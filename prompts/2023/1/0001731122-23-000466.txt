About Forza X1 
 
Our mission is to inspire the adoption of sustainable recreational boating by producing stylish electric sport boats. We are focused on the creation, implementation and sale of electric boats utilizing our electric vehicle (“EV”) technology to control and power our boats and proprietary outboard electric motor. Our electric boats are being designed as fully integrated electric boats including the hull, outboard motor and control system.
 
The three main components of our electric boats are: (1) the fiberglass part of the boat, (2) the motor that propels the boat and (3) the control system. To date, we have completed the design of two electric boat models and have completed tooling the molds which are required to build the physical fiberglass boat. To date, we have completed the design and prototyping of the electric outboard motor that will be used as the initial propulsion source for all electric models. We have also completed the design and prototyping and have begun testing the boats’ integrated control system. We have also entered into a supply agreement for the supply of the lithium battery packs that we plan to use to power the electric boats. We expect to begin production of our two FX1 electric boats and commence selling to end user customers by the end of 2023.
 
We believe that the boating industry will follow in the footsteps of the electrification of the automotive industry by creating electric boats that meet or exceed the traditional boating consumer’s expectations of price, value and run times. In other words, electric boats must offer a similar experience when compared to traditional gas-powered boat in terms of size, capability and price point.
 
We were initially a wholly owned subsidiary of Twin Vee PowerCats Co. (“Twin Vee”). Prior to our incorporation on October 15, 2021, we operated as the Electra Power Sports™ Division of Twin Vee. Following the Twin Vee initial public offering that closed on July 23, 2021 (the “Twin Vee IPO”), Twin Vee determined in October 2021 that for several reasons that include, but are not limited to, avoiding confusion in the marketplace between its legacy Twin Vee gas-powered line of boats, that the company would market its new independent line of electric boats under a new brand name (and new subsidiary) separate and apart from Twin Vee. Twin Vee and Forza X1 brands are unique in their own way, including (i) the profile of the targeted Forza X1 customer who is environmentally conscious and would purchase an electric boat versus gas-powered model, (ii) the marketing and sales strategy of each company, and (iii) Twin Vee’s use of a third-party dealer network whereas Forza X1 plans on implementing a digital direct to consumer model. In addition, electric powered boats will require a specific and unique level of training and knowledge for supporting and servicing the technical and warranty claims that might arise. The service and support of gas and electric powered boats are very different, and it became clear to us that Forza required its own unique brand. As a result, on October 15, 2021, we were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Twin Vee and Twin Vee transferred the entirety of its electric boat business to us pursuant to an assignment of assets agreement and other agreements. Our majority shareholder, Twin Vee, developed and tested the Twin Vee 280 Electric – 2.0 Prototype, which was a Twin Vee 28-foot gas-powered catamaran boat retrofitted with an electric propulsion system. After the successful sea trial of the Twin Vee 280 Electric – 2.0 Prototype in November 2021, Twin Vee decided to develop a new multi-hull, catamaran design for its electric boats and not seek to retrofit an electric propulsion system into a boat originally designed for a gas-engine.
 
Originally, Twin Vee anticipated it would use the same factory and many of the same employees to manufacture both its gas-powered boats and its electric boats. Twin Vee also initially anticipated that its electric boats would be similar to the initial prototype, a retrofitted Twin Vee catamaran boat with an electric motor added to the boat. However, after the test run of the initial prototype and Twin Vee’s reassessment of the market demand, Twin Vee determined that the electric boat should be a newly designed boat with an integrated electric motor, as opposed to a retrofitted Twin Vee boat with an electric motor added to the boat, making it less cost effective to use the current Twin Vee factory for its electric boat manufacturing. In addition, with the increase in Twin Vee’s production since the Twin Vee IPO from one gas-powered boat per week, to an average of 4 gas-powered boats per week in 2022, and our view that the demand for fully integrated electric boats has increased significantly since the Twin Vee IPO (which view is based on, among other things, verbal feedback that we have received from boat distributors and potential consumers), there is limited additional manufacturing capacity at Twin Vee’s current facility for the manufacture of the electric boats. Furthermore, it became apparent that a dedicated facility for manufacturing electric boats would be more efficient given that different equipment, design specifications and personnel is required for the production of electric boats compared to gas-powered boats. For example, a cleanroom, which is a controlled environment that has a low level of pollutants such as dust, is required for the manufacture of our electric boats but not for Twin Vee’s gas-powered boats. Therefore, in November 2021 Twin Vee decided to build a second factory for the manufacture of the electric boats and to hire a separate, second set of employees focused solely on manufacturing fully integrated electric boats.

Twin Vee also came to believe that the current Twin Vee business model, which primarily includes designing, manufacturing and marketing gas-powered boats that are primarily sold through independent dealers, may not work best for Forza’s business, which includes developing fully integrated environmentally friendly electric boats that will be sold primarily directly to the end user via our proprietary web-based and app platform. As stated above, it was originally anticipated that Twin Vee would retrofit a gas-powered boat with an electric motor that would be designed by Twin Vee and that Twin Vee would also sell the electric motors to other third-party boat manufacturers to retrofit their boats. However, Twin Vee came to realize that consumer preference in the electric marine market was and is trending towards the single purchase of a fully integrated electric boat with a technically advanced control system, electric motor and battery pack system, rather than the purchase of a retrofitted hull configured by replacing a boat’s traditional gas and diesel fuel powered fuel compartments with an advanced control system, electric motor and battery pack. Many companies that manufacture gas-powered boats have not embraced the concept of retrofitting their existing gas and diesel fuel powered boats with electric outboard motors and battery packs given that in many cases electric motors are more expensive than gas-powered motors and are generally viewed as less powerful resulting in a more limited range. Furthermore, retrofitting an electric motor with various other boat manufacturers would require extensive development, testing and manufacturing of multiple variations of electric motors, which are no longer required. As a result, the decision not to design and sell a separate electric motor will, we believe, result in significant cost savings as a separate motor would have required a new custom design for each boat retrofitted with the motor as well as a separate stand-alone sales and marketing team. As a result of the decision to design a new boat with an integrated electric motor, Forza X1 can focus on “integrated and factory installed” electric boats where all of the components of an integrated electric boat (i.e., technically advanced control system, electric motor and battery pack system) are combined under a single, stand-alone brand (and entity) that is manufactured in its own facility, which we and Twin Vee believe will be a more successful strategy than attempting to retrofit former gas-powered boats and sell electric motors. In light of the foregoing and the current valuations for electric technology-based companies, such as Rivian and Lucid, it was determined that financing the new factory and developing, manufacturing and marketing fully integrated electric boats would have the greatest chance of success if Forza X1 were to be a stand-alone, publicly traded company.
 
First FX1 Models
 
Forza X1, working with naval architect Albert Nazarov and his company, Albatross Marine Design, have completed the designs of Forza X1’s first boat, the FX1. Unlike the two prototypes developed by Twin Vee, the FX1 model will not be a retrofitted Twin Vee catamaran hull with an electric propulsion system. Instead, the FX1 model is being built based on an entirely new design that will incorporate the same control system as the second prototype.

Our initial two models, the FX1 Dual Console and FX1 Center Console, are being designed to be 25-foot in length, have an 8’ beam or width and utilize a catamaran hull surface to reduce drag and increase run times. To date, we have completed the design of the 25-foot FX dual console model, including hull, deck and small parts. This design has gone from an intellectual concept in CAD to fiberglass and foam plugs, fiberglass molds and, finally, working boat parts in just over one year. 
 
The initial launch of FX1 will include our proprietary single electric outboard motor. Both FX1 models are being designed with advanced high-powered, liquid-cooled lithium battery packs that will be provided by the third party supplier with whom we have entered into a five year supply agreement and a vehicle control unit with proprietary control software all integrated into a 22-inch master control touch screen that will be used to control most functions of the boat.
 
On October 28, 2022, the running surface of the boat and all major components were tested successfully on the Indian River Lagoon in Fort Pierce, Florida. While the motor and control systems have been successfully trialed previously, this was the first voyage including all major components, production batteries, fully functioning “alpha” engine design, control system - including 22” Garmin screen, and Osmosis telematics unit. The performance of the boat exceeded all expectations and will provide a great baseline for improvements, iterations, and design enhancements. We ultimately reached over thirty miles per hour.
 
Subsequent to the initial prototype boat, we started four more prototypes: two more FX-style catamarans, one deck boat and one 22-foot center console monohull. These prototypes have been fully built out and were run in March of 2023. The engine design and lower units and the control system cabling have been revamped and improved in each iteration. The monohull will feature a single battery and the deck boat will, like the FX, utilize a two-battery system. The batteries and engines are liquid-cooled and unique improvements to the heat exchanges have improved performance.
 
We have also filed three design, five utility and two full non-provisional patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating to, among other things, our propulsion system being developed and boat design.

Forza’s Marketing Plans 
 
We plan to market and sell our model offerings in a variety of ways. One way will be to operate in a fundamentally different manner and structure than traditional marine manufacturers and boat dealers by adopting a direct-to-consumer sales model. We are building a dedicated web and app-based platform for sales, deliveries, and service operations to change the traditional boat buying and marine service experience through technological innovation, ease of use, and flexibility. We intend to employ an integrated, digital-first strategy that is convenient and transparent for our customers and efficient and scalable to support our growth. Additionally, to support those looking for a more traditional way of purchasing a boat, or to accompany trade-ins, financing needs, and training, we will also market our boats through a partnership with OneWater Marine, Inc. (“OneWater”), one of the largest dealership networks in the United States. We believe our approach will enable us to provide the best of both worlds to prospective customers and support our mission to electrify recreational boating for mass production.
Forza X1: An All Digital, Direct-to Consumer Platform
 
We intend to offer our EV products, services and support through a Web-based and mobile phone app that will be vertically integrated and a direct-to-consumer platform. Over the last couple of years, non-contact consumerism has brought shopping and customer service experiences to a new level that will likely remain prevalent long after the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to create a high quality customer experience that spans the entire life of our products through an online system that is being designed to be comprehensive, seamless, and efficient for a customer experience. For consumers and states that require a physical location we will develop partnerships, similar to the one we have established with One Water.
 
We plan to utilize a web-based and app platform to connect with customers for an end-to-end experience encompassing everything from buying, financing, delivery, servicing, and training. We have commenced the design of the web-based platform but have not yet commenced design of the app. This customer-centric approach to sales and service aims at simplifying access to necessary information for potential buyers and current owners alike. Customers will be able to communicate directly with us to ensure their questions are answered and their needs are met.

Currently, our web and app-based platform is expected to include the following:
 

● | Build and Price Boats. The web and app platform will offer prospective buyers a place to examine photos and videos of our boats, which will all have a single price based on the model type and a few available options. For example, the consumer would have four gel coat exterior choices, three interior upholstery choices, and an option to increase the battery pack capacity for extended run times. Other options would include charging cords and plugs, boating items such as bumpers, covers, and fun add-ons like clothing, allowing consumers to “personalize” their Forza X1 purchase.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Financing. Prospective customers will be able to apply for third-party consumer financing to complete or supplement their purchase through our web and app platform. 
● | Delivery. Once manufactured, the boat will be delivered directly to a customer’s home, marina, or wherever they choose. The scheduling, communication, and support necessary for coordinating touchless delivery of our Forza X1 boats would all be accomplished over the website or app. 


● | Servicing. We intend to offer highly tailored and differentiated services that enable intuitive experiences throughout the entire customer lifecycle, such as warranty, repair, or other service assistance for their boats. We expect this all-inclusive approach will provide higher customer satisfaction, create strong brand loyalty, and increase operational efficiency while simultaneously allowing us to capture a more significant share of the entire lifecycle value of every Forza X1 boat produced. We anticipate having internal staff with the capability to provide an OTA update to resolve the issue remotely without the boat ever leaving the customer’s sight. As part of our customer satisfaction drive, we plan for our staff to make mobile service calls to the boat docks. We also intend to enter into partnering arrangements with third parties to address service needs that require more than a mobile service visit, and we plan to arrange for the boat to be picked up and brought to one of our partnered service centers. If a service center is not available in a customer’s area, for approved warranty repairs we will permit the owners to take their boat to their local service center who will then invoice us.

● | Customer Service and Feedback. We will utilize customer insights and feedback submitted via our web and app-based platform to improve our offerings by adding new capabilities and functionality. Expanded offerings based on consumer-driven feedback and data is expected to attract more customers, deepen existing customer relationships, and allow us to innovate more quickly. 
● | Training. We intend to provide a series of videos that demonstrate our boats’ safe operation and upkeep. These videos would be accessible on our web and app platform and the boat’s onboard computer for quick access.

With respect to the foregoing, we have not yet: (i) entered into any arrangements with third parties to provide financing services through our web and app platform, or (ii) hired staff for our intended support and service department. We are still in the initial stages of establishing its distribution and service plans. We expect to commence selling to end-user customers by the end of 2023. We are currently in the process of identifying the states we will be allowed to sell direct-to-consumer. For states that have do not allow such an arrangement, we intend to make sales through OneWater’s locations. OneWater will be able to forecast how many FX1 boats they initially require, and after production, we will have the boats transported to the dealerships.
 
Similarly, we are in the process of identifying potential marine service centers and technicians we would like to form strategic relationships with to ensure that we have a comprehensive service support system in place when our FX1 boats are sold, we will utilize OneWater dealerships and service centers where they are available. We will also work to establish our 500-mile radius mobile service vans and trucks before selling the first Forza X1 product so that local customers will have that option.
 
The OneWater Agreement
 
Additionally, to support those looking for a more traditional way of purchasing a boat, or to accompany trade-ins, financing needs, and training, we will also market our boats through a partnership with OneWater, one of the largest dealership networks in the United States. We believe our approach will enable us to provide the best of both worlds to prospective customers and support our mission to electrify recreational boating. On August 17, 2022, we entered into a five-year agreement with OneWater to establish our customer experience and service centers in OneWater’s current and future locations and other strategic locations across the United States pursuant to which OneWater will be the sole dealer distributing our products and OneWater’s retail locations may be used as potential delivery points for customers to pick up our products. We retained the right to sell our products directly to customers. The agreement may be terminated by either party for breach upon thirty days’ notice and without cause upon three months’ notice.
Forza X1 Purpose
 
According to the Environmental Energy Student Institute, a non-profit organization originally formed by a bipartisan group of members of Congress, fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, have been powering economies for over 150 years and currently supply about 80 percent of the world’s energy. When fossil fuels are burned, the stored carbon and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. The excess buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has caused dramatic changes to Earth’s climate—a trend that will worsen as more fossil fuels are burned. Further climate changes may cause rises in sea level, extreme weather, biodiversity loss, and species extinction, as well as food scarcity, worsening health, and poverty for millions of people worldwide.
 
The world’s waterways are also in danger from pollutants caused by gas-powered motors. In the landmark environmental study and book, “Polluting for Pleasure”, author Andre Mele stated that recreational boats, particularly outboards, were polluting as much as all the cars and trucks in America. At the time, Mele discovered that pleasure boats have polluted 80 times more than automobile engines and put more oil into American waters than 15 Exxon Valdez oil spills, annually. The popularity of recreational boating has grown since then.
 
While headway is being made by the automotive industry introducing more viable EV options to replace traditional automobiles, it is also vital that we look to preserve our waterways while reducing carbon emissions. Large gas-powered engines often leak fuel and produce carbon emissions, both of which are harmful to fragile marine ecosystems. We are a company comprised of people who are passionate to move the preservation and carbon free marine lifestyle forward. According to the Bloomberg NEF’s 2021 Electric Vehicle Outlook, passenger automotive EV sales are set to increase from 3.1 million units in 2020 to 14 million units in 2025.
 
We aim to manufacture electric boats with a proprietary electric outboard motor that has been designed and integrated with our own control system. The Forza X1 boats are being designed for the production of a combined boat and motor package, along with our control system that we intend to market and sell as a single package. Our Forza X1 boat is intended to work seamlessly and offer families and water recreation enthusiasts an enjoyable time for an affordable price.
 
Our core market corresponds most directly to those who identify with environmentally friendly vehicles. Electric boats promote environmental sustainability and allow for a much more serene and enjoyable time on the water. The adoption of electric vehicles has increased considerably over the years as they are more environmentally friendly. As per the report by Bloomberg NEF, there are currently 12 million passenger EVs on the road, and the prevalence of electric-powered boats is likely to follow suit. While electric boats only represented about 2% of the market in 2020, a report by IDTechEx shows that the market for hybrid and pure electric boats is expected to rise rapidly to greater than $20 billion worldwide by 2027, finding that recreational boats is the largest and fastest growing electric marine market in sales number.
 
We plan to disrupt recreational marine customs that rely on outdated processes and noxious engines by designing, engineering and manufacturing inspiring electric boats that operate in a more sustainable and eco-friendly way.

240 Electric – Prototype 
 
The first prototype of the electric boat, the 240 Electric, was developed by Twin Vee and publicly announced on December 18, 2020. Wanting to expand its offering to include electric-powered boats, Twin Vee created its Twin Vee Electric division. Twin Vee Electric sought to retrofit a Twin Vee-branded 24-foot center console boat and enable it to run on a bank of lithium-ion batteries. The team worked almost a year designing and developing the first prototype electric boat.
 
In early May 2021 the first prototype was tested in the Indian River near North Hutchinson Island in Fort Pierce, Florida. The initial prototype failed during testing, resulting in the creation of the second prototype with an improved control system.
 
280 Electric – 2.0 Prototype
 
The second prototype, which was a 28-foot Twin Vee retrofitted catamaran was built by Twin Vee with an improved control system, which is the same control system that we intend to install in the electric boats that we are currently designing for mass production.
 
The 280E electric boat consists of two (2) in-board motors with a comprehensive system of control device, display, two lever throttle, touchscreen display, an all-new 86KWH Battery pack, IDU J-box Micro Controller, High Power distribution unit, inverter and motor, and onboard charger as shown in figure 1 below. We intend to use a similar main console for the Forza FX1.
 
The main console consists of a dual lever throttle, display and a key switch. The boat speed control function is activated by deflecting the friction throttle lever forward or reverse. Deflecting the throttle handle sends a control signal to the Microcontroller, which sends the digital signal over CANBUS to the inverter, which provides the energy flow path from battery pack to the motor, thus turning the propeller. The throttle function uses a cruise control feature, which enables the system to automatically adapt to a set speed, operating the battery efficiently as possible without manual intervention.
 
The key switch in the control system activates the main electrical systems (i.e., the battery pack, Inverter, OBC) for the boat, including the accessories, such as the bilge pump, horn, hatch control, etc.
 
The display is a comprehensive system (Battery and Inverter Data) utilizing control software that goes beyond simple monitoring. With the display, the operator gets the additional functionality of alerts. Alerts allow the boat’s operator to setup as many warnings and alarms as they may need so they can be forewarned of potential problems. Additionally, the control functionality provides operators with the ability to manage the electrical system.
 
The IDU J-box is plug and play for easy installation, which contains the main controller connecting pumps for different cooling systems as well as the battery pack, onboard charger, and inverter to control the boat speed. The panel is completely electrical based on 24 VDC volts from the boat’s electrical supply. The IDU J-box is installed under the console for ease of access. The battery pack is connected over the CANBUS network with the IDU microcontroller.
 
These systems were installed in the second prototype at the end of October 2021. The boat, motors and control system were successfully tested out of the water and in Twin Vee’s Fort Pierce facility. These tests included operating the motors through a series of increased and decreased power settings, continuous checks for temperature fluctuations within the battery, battery management system, vehicle control unit, and glycol cooling system. These tests were initially light load tests and once successful, allowed testing to move to medium load, and then high load testing which included the second prototype being launched from Stan Blum Boat Ramp near North Hutchinson Island in Fort Pierce Florida for a sea trial on November 4, 2021. The boat was successfully tested in the water and performed a series of maneuvers and tests. All in water testing included continuous operation and monitoring of all sensors, flow temperatures, battery temperatures, power settings and connectors and glycol flow. We concluded that our system was designed well and allowed us to move to the next stages of our development.
 
As a result of the sea trial, the engineering team identified major control system components capable of withstanding the marine environment while completing a series of maneuvers for an extended period of time. Knowledge of these critical components, including the display, throttle with steering (0-360Deg), onboard charging, high voltage power distribution unit, controller, cooling motors, steering feedback sensor, tilt feedback sensor, charging CCS1 socket, inverter and electric motor, as well as the experience gained in making them work in unison allowed our engineering team to fine tune the technical design aspects of the second prototype so that plans for our proprietary control system and outboard electric motor could be developed.
 
Since the successful launch of the second prototype, we have accomplished the mechanical design of our electric outboard motor and control system, sourcing and detailed fabrication blueprints are completed. The electrical bills of materials, mechanical bills of materials, and assembly fixturing has been completed that are all fundamental to the building and testing of the systems. Over 50 distinct custom parts have been designed for this prototype using 3D modeling software. 3D CAD models, assemblies, as well as 2D fabrication drawings following ASME standards have been completed and sent out to several machine shops, rapid prototype houses and casting suppliers in the US and overseas. At the same time, we are working with local machine shops within a two-hour radius of Ft. Pierce to establish business relationships that will enable future quick turn door to door parts rework and delivery.

We are in the early stage of prototyping and testing our electric boats. The first Forza FX1 prototype outboard motor and control system was completed in Q1 2022, by March of 2023 we had complete four other prototypes and have begun the testing phase on all of these boats. We anticipate that our prototypes will go through additional testing, interactions and refinements before we commence production of consumer boats and thereafter the commercialization of our products. The electric motor and control system are in working, functioning order, our team of engineers have begun the process to build an additional six or more prototype outboard motors. These additional motors will be the same power, shape and design of our working prototype. The additional motors are being produced for the purpose of intensive testing, destruction testing, longevity testing with the goal of commercialization and manufacturing this motor as the original propulsion system for our initial two models to be launched, our FX1 dual console and FX1 center console electric boats. The testing of our prototype motor will continue on a test bed boat that was designed and built specifically for the initial testing. In a parallel path, we have completed the design phase of our FX1 boat, this boat has begun the tooling process, which is the making of the molds required to produce and manufacture the final fiberglass FX1 product. The tooling of the molds are estimated to be completed by Q3 2022 and our first FX1 center console boat as displayed in our graphic images should be completed and rigged with our FX1 motor and control system by Q3 2022. We expect to begin production of our initial FX1 dual console and FX1 center console models and commence selling to end user customers by the end of 2023.
 
Catamaran Technology –Reduced Drag and Extended Run Times
 
We plan to utilize a newly designed multi-hull, catamaran design for our FX1 boat. There is a multitude of benefits for catamaran multi-hulled boats, including better performance, two narrow hulls generate about one-third as much wetted-surface or drag, reduced hydrodynamic resistance allowing for more speed or requiring less power to operate.
 
Catamarans also ride softer because they don’t have a large, round bottom that slams against the waves. In other words, the reduced vertical accelerations on the water from a multi-hull boat helps prevent slamming for a smoother ride.
 
Additional advantages of a multi-hull boat are better stability and an increased level of safety, higher freeboard and flotation. Lastly, multi-hull boats provide a superior amount of comfort for passengers. There is typically plenty of space and accommodations on deck with a catamaran that is difficult to replicate on monohulls.
 
Unlike the two prototypes developed by Twin Vee, the FX1 model we are designing will not be a retrofitted Twin Vee catamaran. Although the FXI model is being designed to incorporate the same control system as the second prototype, the FX1 model is being built based on an entirely new design developed for us by naval architect Albert Nazarov and his company, Albatross Marine Design.
 
Dimensioning of Catamarans – Parametric Approach
    Naval architect Albert Nazarov and his company, Albatross Marine Design, have designed our FX1 boat with mathematical precision. The base system of design equations describing the design can be written as following:
 


Where first equation is relation of sum of required volumes vi and available volume vA; second equation is balance of craft mass M and volume displacement V; third and fourth are comparisons of design speed vs. and range r with required speed [vs.]R and range [r]R. Fifth equation specifies condition of seakeeping as not exceeding certain acceleration level aCG/g. Last equation is criteria of minimization of construction cost S, though operational costs might be considered for complete analysis. Stability condition is excluded from preliminary analysis of catamarans.

Forza X1 Outboard Motor
 
We have completed the design phase of our outboard motor and which is now in the prototype phase of developing and preparing to manufacture it to power our new 24-foot FX1 boat. The outboard motor is expected to provide the FX1 with the capacity for up to 35 knots of speed and 215HP (peak) of power, subject to varying levels, loads, winds, currents and speeds.

Figure 3 — Current specifications of the system
 
Outboard Design
 
The outboard system is designed with modular sub systems. The subsystems connect to a central upper assembly in a common way so that development task management and subsequent engineering activities can take place concurrently if needed. The subsystems include steering, cooling, lower POD drive units, trim and tilt, and cover assemblies.
 
14




Core Motor and Gear Reducer Information
 
The motor is the heart of the entire outboard drive system. Because its output RPM is up to 10,000 RPM it must be reduced to achieve the proper torque on the output propeller. To accomplish this our team had to develop a proprietary custom gear reducer which is incorporated in the core motor. This gear reducer features a two-stage planetary gear assembly with an overall 1.9:1 ratio. The planetary gear reducer is designed to accommodate vertical orientation which is ideal for mounting inside the Forza X1 Outboard.
 


A compliant shaft coupler connects the output shaft of the gear reducer to the lower drive unit which is illustrated in the following sections. The shaft coupler includes a compliant membrane which is engineered to accommodate torsional continuous loads as well as sudden “shock” loads which may occur when reversing shaft rotation. The output shaft is fed through the slewing bearing steering assembly. This is a unique design for outboards for which we filed a design patent application on December 10, 2021, which application is currently pending approval.
 
15


Upper Assembly
 
The upper assembly is the central “torso” of the outboard structure. It houses the main core motor and gear reducer, as well as provides a modular mounting structure for the motor controller, cooling system, steering system, trim and tilt as well as the covers.
 
The upper assembly is being designed to be made from 6061-T6 aircraft grade aluminum alloys. The Trim/Tilt mount is attached to the upper frame block with 5 M12 high strength socket head cap screws as well as 3 supporting M10 socket head cap screws. The mount features a cross pattern which will support and distribute the load for the entire weight of the outboard, as well as transmit the static stress loads through the structure while under operation.
 


16


The central frame design is also proprietary in that it allows for an easy vertical mounting of the core motor assembly but also allows the entire core motor assembly to be removed from one side of the outboard, without a complete teardown of the system. The shape of the uni-body profile includes engineered clearance to accommodate the rare occasion of a motor needing extended service and replacement. We have filed a design patent application for the design of the central frame, which application is currently pending approval.
 


The motor controller frame attaches to the uni-body frame with a set of M8 socket head cap screws. The frame is CNC machined, like the uni-body structure, however it is designed to be removed and replaced as needed as the design of the system matures.
 
Steering System
 
The initial version of our motor will utilize a traditional marine steering system. We are also developing a novel steering system for our version 2.0 motor. It incorporates slew bearing technology that is proven in heavy equipment, wind turbines, and military systems, and combines it with custom gearing, and a coupling interface with the lower POD drive unit. This mechanical steering system in combination with electronically controlled power steering from the helm results in up to 360-degree POD rotation for the lower unit. The upper assembly for the outboard is fixed which is designed to keep the center of gravity stable at high-speed turning, and the 360-degree power steering is expected to result in an un-matched user experience to make boat docking and maneuvering easier than ever before.
 


17


The slewing bearing assembly is precision engineered with high grade 400 series stainless steel bearings, fully sealed encased pinion gear system that is modular. A slewing bearing or slewing ring (also called a turntable bearing) is a rotational rolling-element bearing that typically supports a heavy but slow-turning or slowly oscillating loads in combination (axial, radial and moment loads), often a horizontal platform such as a conventional crane, a swing yarder, or the wind-facing platform of a horizontal-axis (yaw) windmill. In other orientations (e.g., a horizontal axis of rotation) they are used in materials handling grapples, forklift attachments, welding turnover jigs and so on.
 
Compared to a “normal” ball bearing the rings are quite wide and usually have holes drilled in them to provide fixation to a structure. Seals will be provided between the rings to protect the rolling elements. Compared to other rolling-element bearings, slewing bearings are relatively thin sections and require that the structure to which they are bolted is stiff enough so that under load predefined limits of distortion are not exceeded.
 
Slewing bearing designs range from single row ball or roller style, through double row ball or roller, triple row roller, combined (1 roller/ 1 ball) or wore guided raceways — each design having its own special characteristics and application. The Forza X1 design features precision engineered ceramic ball bearings which are designed to withstand the marine environment and are easily replaceable for teardown and rebuilds.
 
Cooling System
 
The cooling system consists of a raw water circuit that feeds up from the lower pod propeller unit and into a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger passes an internal glycol fluid over a series of interspersed tubes where heat conduction takes place to regulate the temperature of the glycol. The glycol is circulated through the gear reducer assembly, core motor and controller/inverter. The circuit uses a glycol pump mounted on or near the uni-body frame. The raw water exits from the heat exchanger and is released through a tube from the upper assembly.
Lower POD Propeller Assembly
 
The lower drive unit is a proprietary design that includes an advanced steering system, which allows up to 360 degrees of rotation of the propeller direction. This should result in boat owners realizing a higher level of vessel control when under speed as well as for docking and mooring maneuvers.
 
Furthermore, the lower drive unit is expected to include an easy interchange mechanism. This interchange mechanism will allow for different lower drive unit configurations to attach to a common upper motor assembly.

The propeller lower POD unit is expected to include a primary aluminum cast housing that is specifically engineered for electric propulsion. Because of the electric drive there is no need for the traditional reversing clutch mechanism or clutch actuation rod, or even the chambers for raw water exiting near the rear of the unit. This results in a lighter weight design with less parts and a more efficient drivetrain.
 
Forza X1 Battery Details
 
Nowadays, the most expensive part of an electric vehicle is the battery, which represents as much as 50% of the price of the electric propulsion system, depending on the technology used. Lithium-ion batteries are the most used technology in EVs due to their high energy density and increased power per mass battery unit.
 
The disadvantage of Lithium-ion batteries is their high developed operational temperature, which could affect energetic performances, along with lifetime expectations. This technology requires a battery management system (BMS) to control and monitor internal cell temperature. Apart from the disadvantages caused by exploitation temperature, there are also problems related to high production costs, recycling capacity of batteries out of use, and recharging infrastructure.
 
Our designers have the following general parameters in mind for the outboard battery system:
 
1) A module size of 36” x 12” x 4”
 
2) Mountable vertically or horizontally
 
3) Liquid cooling.
 
4) An IP rating of at least IP64, preferably IP65
 
5) Internal shock absorption.
 
Mounting of the battery packs is a crucial task especially for the 104kW battery range. These packs must be mounted with careful engineering for vibration isolation, cooling systems and ease of access in order to have the proper working and successful service procedures.
 
We have entered into a five- year supply agreement with a third-party lithium battery reseller to begin supplying us with a line-up of standardized high-voltage battery packs. The battery packs are highly flexible and modular that can be scaled in series or in parallel.
 
The battery packs are based on the world-class 2170 cylindrical cells and have the highest energy density solution in the market with approximately 200 Wh/kg, while also allowing advanced monitoring and diagnostic reporting. The packs contain a highly efficient, liquid cooled thermal management system and the sealed enclosures are rated IP65, which eliminates potential for debris and weather to get inside the battery pack.

Onboard Battery Charging System
 
We intend to utilize multiple charging options that are currently available in the marketplace. The battery charging market has designed and commercially sold faster charging systems for years, but along with the increased speed of charging times, the cost of the equipment also goes up in price. We intend to offer an AC charging system that will be standard with the base boat. Additionally, we intend to offer a Direct Current or “DC” fast charging protocol as an option or as standard equipment on larger, higher priced boats. Specifically, we will adopt the most common connector plug for EV charging, the J1772, which was chosen by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) as the standard in North America and Japan.
 
20


We will mostly utilize an alternating current (AC) charging current. Alternating current (AC) is typically how people charge their electric vehicles overnight. AC charging uses a lower voltage, either Level 1 (120 volts or normal household current) or Level 2 (240 volts or the equivalent power of an electric dryer). Though the low voltage levels mean a slower charge, AC charging can be easily installed in most households. It is a convenient solution for residential, workplace, multi-unit dwellings, and other longer-term parking locations like hotels and municipal or airport parking garages.
 
Direct current (DC) charging for electric vehicles allows for higher charging speeds, since DC can be supplied directly to the electric vehicle’s battery at power levels normally higher than AC charging. The higher the DC power supplied, the faster the electric vehicle can be charged—provided the EV is designed to handle such power. Charging will slow down toward the end of each charging session in order to preserve the battery. This typically happens around 80% full.
 
The Combined Charging System (CCS) is a direct current (DC) fast charging protocol that is Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) certified and is featured on vehicles produced by European and American car companies. The “combined” term in the CCS name designates its capability to incorporate the Level 2 (J1772 standard) plug and DC fast charging connector into the same larger plug.
 
The unit of energy to power an electric motor and charge a battery pack is based on the kWh or Kilo Watt Hour. A kWh unit of energy equivalent to the energy transferred or expended in one hour by one kilowatt of power. Electric car or boat battery sizes are measured in kilowatt-hours.
 
The FX1 boat may have the option for a 6.6 kW or 12 kW onboard charger compatible with Level 2 in-house charging. This means it can be charged at home from any outlet. When connected to a standard 120V 10A outlet, the charge rate is limited to 4 kW. We expect that from a capacity of 25% the charge time using a fast charging or Inboard 50A system will range from 1.5 hours to 5 hours for the FX1 boat. Charge times are as shown below:
 

Power source | Charging Rate | DC Charging Current | Charge time
-------------------------+---------------+---------------------+------------
Fast Charge | 45.0 kW | 125A | 1.8 hours 
Inboard 50A | 12.0 kW | 33A | 6.7 hours 
Inboard 30A dryer outlet | 6.6 kW | 18A | 12.1 hours 
Standard 120 Outlet | 4.0 kW | 11A | 20.0 hours 

 


21


This assumes a standard 104kWh pack discharged to 20 kWh with a 20% reserve.
 
FX1 Screen Integration
 
We are working to integrate a 22-inch screen into our FX1 console. The screen will be utilized for functionality including GPS mapping, depth finder, fish finder, speedometer, electronic compass, battery sensors, power rating, battery usage reporting, lighting controls, bilge and water pumps controls, autopilot and more. The screen would reduce traditional buttons that typically clutter a boat console and enhance a customer’s boating experience. We are designing a customized graphical user interface at the helm to provide FX1 boat owners access to a suite of various systems, sonar technologies, autopilot, apps, engine data, and multimedia, all on one screen. Specifically, we plan to install a large-format multifunction display featuring a 22-inch full HD screen with touch control in Forza X1 boats. The sunlight-readable anti-glare large display should enable owners to experience a powerful, completely networked helm.
 
Our plans include a fully digital switching system that will allow users to power up their boat while away from the dock, switch on pumps, control lights, and underwater lights. Moreover, customers would be able to configure the entire system to provide 1-touch setting access for docking, cruising, fishing, and anchoring without manually switching each monitor separately.
 
Forza X1 Intellectual Property
 
We are working to create a portfolio of proprietary designs and technology that we expect to serve as the foundation of our product development. To date, we have three design and four utility patent applications on file with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Certain of the patent applications were originally filed by, and in the name of, the individual who was the inventor of the technology and since have been assigned to us. Below is a list of pending patent applications that we are seeking approval for from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that our issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. See “Intellectual Property Risks.”

Forza FX1 Future Factory 
 
We are currently designing a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant to incorporate the latest in closed-molded composite boat building technologies and electric engine assembly processes., On July 28, 2022, we received notice that the North Carolina Economic investment committee has approved a Job Development Investment Grant (“JDIG”) providing for reimbursement to
 us of up to $1,367,100 over a twelve-year period to establish a new manufacturing plant in McDowell County, North Carolina. The receipt of grant funding is conditioned upon us investing over $10.5 million in land, buildings and fixtures, infrastructure and machinery and equipment by the end of 2025 and us creating as many as 170 jobs. We have selected our new site in McDowell County, North Carolina to build the Forza X1 factory. We are designing a 100,000 square foot facility designed for capacity and production of 1,000 units annually that we intend to build over time in various phases, starting with an initial 50,000 square foot facility that will have a capacity of 550 units annually that we anticipate the cost of which will be $8 million for the construction of the factory. We anticipate that the local incentives that it has been approved to receive will help to offset some of the cost to be incurred with respect to the building of the factory. However, there can be no assurance that such negotiations will be successful or that we will meet the requirements to receive the anticipated incentives will be granted to us.
 
23


Initially, the target site for the plant was a 14.5-acre parcel of undeveloped land located in a light industrial corridor in St. Lucie County. We and Twin Vee entered into an assignment of land contract pursuant to which Twin Vee assigned to us a land purchase agreement that provides us with an option to acquire the target site for $750,000. On December 6, 2021, we paid the $50,000 refundable deposit on the land purchase agreement from our working capital. It has since been determined that the cost associated with building our factory on the Fort Pierce, Florida site is prohibitive. As a result, on April 28, 2022, we, together with Twin Vee, requested, and were granted, a release and termination of the land contract for this vacant parcel of land.
 
Once we execute a definitive agreement for the purchase of the property upon which the factory will be built, we anticipate that our factory will be complete within 18 months.
 
Before the completion of new factory construction, all fabrication for our Forza X1 boats will be performed onsite at Twin Vee’s facility or, if available additional manufacturing space will be leased. We are currently looking at various locations near the Twin Vee facility or near the future Forza site to rent a facility until our own facility is finished. We expect that boat production can start immediately upon the Forza X1 product launch. While there is limited additional manufacturing capacity at Twin Vee’s current facility for the manufacture of our electric boats, we believe the Twin Vee site can handle approximately 325 units annually, without capital improvements, in addition to current Twin Vee production.
 
Our ability to utilize Twin Vee’s manufacturing capacity pending completion of our own facility will be subject to its availability as determined by Twin Vee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to commence production of our electric boats as planned.”
 
A phone app will be used to reserve orders, and believe we will be able to fulfill orders from Twin Vee as soon as the product launch is ready. The boat construction cycle (lead time) will be under fifteen working days, engines will be built in advance and will be a five-day build cycle. Since orders and deposits will be taken in advance of product launch, the fiberglass molds for the boats will be built to handle expected orders.
 
We expect production at the Forza FX1 future factory to initially ramp up according to orders received and increase over time.
 
Industry Overview
 
We believe traditional marine manufacturers are at a crossroads and face significant industry-wide challenges. Much like in the automotive industry, the reliance on the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine as the principal marine powertrain technology has raised environmental concerns, created dependence among industrialized and developing nations on oil-primarily imported from foreign countries, exposed consumers to volatile fuel prices, and inhibited innovation in alternative fuel powertrain technologies.
 
We expect that shifting consumer preferences will result in significant growth in the market for electric boats, especially as the demand for recreational powerboats, in general, remains strong. We estimate many consumers are increasingly willing to consider buying electric-powered boats due to the environmental and economic consequences of using gasoline-powered vehicles, as demonstrated by the increased sales of hybrid and electric automobiles in recent years. In its Electric Vehicle Outlook 2021, BloombergNEF estimated that there are currently 12 million passenger EVs on the road. The prevalence of electric-powered boats is likely to follow suit. In an August 2020 Boating Industry online article, the marine-focused magazine indicated that electric boat drives represented about 2% of the market, but hybrid and pure electric boats sales were expected to rise rapidly in the coming years. Specifically, the article cites a report from independent market research company IDTechEx where it examined the electric boat and ship sector. The report estimates that the market for hybrid and pure electric boats and ships would be greater than $20 billion worldwide by 2027, finding that recreational boats is the largest and fastest growing electric marine market in sales number.
 
Our initiative into sustainable marine technologies and products is well-timed. The prevalence of batteries necessary to sustain a marine EV model line is expected to rise and become cheaper. BloombergNEF’s Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook reports that annual lithium-battery demand has proliferated in recent years, and meeting the demand will require unprecedented but achievable increases in materials, components, and cell production. Battery production capacity is expanding as more factories are brought online. Moreover, battery technology that improves power and capacity is being designed, developed, and adopted regularly. According to BloombergNEF’s report, it found that the volume-weighted average price of a lithium-ion battery pack fell 13% from 2019 to $137/kWh (kilowatt-hour) in 2020. The report estimates the volume-weighted average cost of battery packs will drop below $100/kW in 2024. The Company is establishing itself in the market at the right time to help keep production costs as low as possible and make our boats affordable for our customers.
 
Our Solution
 
Our company believes our solid foundation in boat building, electric vehicle engineering expertise, and planned direct-to-consumer system will help us rapidly innovate and introduce new boats and technologies cost-effectively. By operating our sales and service network, we believe we can offer a compelling and premium customer-centric experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues that traditional boat manufacturers do not receive in the independent dealer model. We also plan to leverage our electric powertrain technology to develop and sell powertrain components to other boat manufacturers and owners.
 
We believe our proprietary electric powertrain system will enable us to design and develop zero-emission boats that overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric boats. As a result, we believe customers of our vehicles will enjoy many benefits, including:
 
24



● | Extended Run Times and Recharging Flexibility. We are designing our FX1 to offer an intermediate-range option and an option that would increase the battery pack capacity for extended run times. Charging stations specifically designed for electric boats will eventually be an option for customers as well. Norway and Venice, Italy, are beginning to construct a network of electric boat charging stations. In the United States, Lake Tahoe is now home to a rapid-charging electric boat charging station. While the US and the rest of the world begin to adopt a network of electric boat-specific stations, our design for the Forza X1 boats incorporates an onboard charging system, permitting recharging from almost any electrical outlet and residential and commercial charging stations previously only utilized for electric automobiles.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Energy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership. We believe our FX1 will offer consumers an attractive cost of ownership compared to similar outboard powerboats. By using a single powertrain and customizing the systems within the electric powertrain and the rest of the boat, our boats are more energy-efficient, and therefore less expensive to operate and maintain. 
● | Environmental sustainability. Large gas-powered engines often leak and produce carbon emissions, both of which are generally harmful to fragile marine ecosystems. By offering a fully electric boat to our customers and an alternative to traditional propulsion systems, we can foster a more environmentally sustainable boat brand. Our greatest hope is to be purposeful stewards of the marine industry and lead by example in environmentally friendly innovation. 
● | Noise Level. So often, powerboats create large amounts of noise, disturbing wildlife and making it difficult for fellow passengers to hear one another while underway. FX1’s electric powertrain will produce little to no sound, making it easier to enjoy the sounds of nature, family, and friends. Our products will also help tremendously with fishing and other sporting and water-based activities that favor less noise. 

Our Strengths and Competitive Advantages
 
We believe that the following are the critical investment attributes of our company:
 

● | Assembling a Technology, Engineering and Manufacturing Team. We continue to build and add valuable, experienced and knowledgeable team members. Jim Leffew, our President and Chief Executive Officer, comes to us from Maverick Boat Group, Inc. that was recently sold to Malibu Boats. Jim Leffew has been designing, building and manufacturing boats on a large-scale basis for over 25 years. The year Maverick Boat Group was sold to Malibu Boats, Jim Leffew was overseeing the manufacturing and Maverick Boat Group was building and selling over 1,400 boats annually. The experience and knowledge that Jim Leffew brings to the table is expected to be valuable to the requirements of designing and ramping up our manufacturing facility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Singular Focus and Leadership in Electric Powertrain Technology. We are focused exclusively on developing our electric boats and electric powertrain technology to achieve a compelling combination of range and performance at a price point accessible to a large segment of the boating population. We intend to use our electric powertrain expertise to innovate rapidly and sustain technological and time-to-market advantages over other marine manufacturers. Our targeted base cost for the Forza X1 is approximately $150,000. We are not aware of any other electric boats currently being manufactured and sold commercially in the U.S. The electric boats we are aware of that are in pre-production by other manufacturers are designed either for the luxury or speed boat market and carry a base cost in the range of approximately $300,000.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Combination of Expertise from the Traditional Boat Manufacturing Industry and Electrical Engineers. Our company’s founders have been in the boat building business for over 25 years. Our boat design and manufacturing knowledge are supplemented by engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering and software and controls. 
● | Rapid Customer-Focused Product Development. We are designing our product development process to rapidly react to data collected from our boats, direct interaction with our customers, and feedback from our web and app platform. That information should enable us to introduce new models and features to expand our customer base and brand recognition. 
● | Direct To Consumer System. We are building a vertically integrated and premium direct-to-consumer system to achieve operating efficiencies and capture sales and service revenues traditional boat manufacturers do not generally receive in the distribution and service model they employ. 
● | Capital Efficiency. We believe our rapid product development process, powertrain technology applicable for future boat models, and our plan to hold lower inventory levels while still meeting customer demand will help reduce the capital required to reach operating efficiencies. This approach is designed to allow us to achieve profitability at relatively low sales volumes and create a viable long-term business.

Our Strategy
 
We intend to be a leading manufacturer and direct seller of electric boats and electric powertrain and propulsion technologies through the following strategies:
 

● | Successfully Launch the FX1 and electric monohull. We believe the successful launch of our first commercially available electric boat is critical to our ability to capitalize on the marine electric vehicle market opportunity and establish ourselves as leaders in the industry. We are in the early stage of prototyping and testing our electric boats. The first Forza FX1 prototype outboard motor and control system was completed in Q1 2022, by Q3 of 2022, the first Forza FX1 catamaran boat was completed and the engine, propulsion systems and boat were successfully tested in October or 2022. By March of 2023 we had completed seven prototypes and had begun the testing phase on all of these boats. In addition to the FX1 style catamaran, we have successfully prototyped a deck boat and twenty-two-foot monohull. We anticipate that our prototypes will go through additional testing, design, and fabrication iterations, and refinements before we commence production of consumer boats. The electric motor and control system are in working order, our team of engineers have begun the process of improving these engines and are developing a “stacking” engine design which will double the horsepower in the same sleek cowling. These additional motors will have improved features including enhanced liquid cooling heat exchangers and higher power availability. Additional motors are being produced for the purpose of intensive reliability and durability testing, utilizing destructive and non-destructive techniques. The goal is to commercialize and manufacture this motor as the original propulsion system for our FX1 dual console. In a parallel path, we are adapting the motor and control system to the twenty-two-foot monohull specifically designed for electric propulsion. We expect to offer these products for sale to the public at the end of 2023. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Invest in Our Infrastructure. We plan to invest in our product development and operations infrastructure to enable our growth, product innovation, and customer experience. 
● | Use a Common Platform to Introduce New Models. We intend to design the FX1 with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain to provide us the flexibility to use the FX1 platform to launch subsequent electric boat models cost-efficiently. 
● | Focus on Technological Advancements and Cost Improvement. We intend to constantly look for ways to improve upon and further develop our proprietary electric powertrain system while reducing its manufacturing cost. 
● | Build our Company-Owned Sales and Service Network. We are programming and building our expansive and vertically integrated customer-centric web and app platform to connect with customers for an end-to-end experience encompassing everything from buying, financing, delivery, servicing, and training. This customer-centric approach to sales and service is intended to simplify accessing necessary information for potential buyers and current owners in an easily accessible and streamlined online space. 
● | Leverage Industry Advancements in Battery Cells. We intend to leverage the substantial investments made globally by battery cell manufacturers to improve power and capacity. 
● | Build and Leverage Strategic Relationships. We intend to establish and develop strategic relationships with industry leaders to launch our planned electric boats and sell our electric boat powertrain components. We envision significant inroads with boat manufacturers to retrofit various hull configurations, replacing traditional gas outboard motors and existing boat owners who could retrofit their boats with Forza X1’s outboard motors, controller, and battery packs. 

Our Future Service Network
 
We intend to develop a support and service department that will include technicians, service representatives, quality control specialists and customer satisfaction agents. Moreover, we aim to provide convenient and comprehensive service coverage in all markets where our boats are sold, which customers may access through a comprehensive service and support website and app.
 
The website and app platform will be the cornerstone of our services and repair program. We have selected a web design firm for the development of our website and app. Our goal is to have the app completed by the second quarter of 2024. Our customers would be able to report through our app or interact directly with our service support team to schedule an appointment with a Forza X1 mobile service van, perform remote diagnostics or help arrange appointments with partnered boat repair technicians, marinas, and service centers with whom we have strategic relationships, arrange for service or repair work, or even schedule the boat’s transportation back to the Forza X1 factory if needed.
 
26


We believe that Forza X1 mobile service vans and trucks will be able to perform a majority of physical service calls at a customer’s home, marina, dock, or wherever our boats might be located, offering a level of convenience at lower cost than traditional dealer-owned service centers. These mobile service vans and trucks will travel to the location of the electric boats for repair, or if the boat cannot be repaired at such location, then the Forza technician will have a vehicle capable of towing the boat back to the Forza factory, where the boat will have access to a more significant amount of repair and support staff.
 
We believe that our electric vehicles will require less service than gas vehicles because electric vehicles are simpler to maintain than internal combustion vehicles. Our outboard motor system is expected to be less susceptible to wear and tear by exchanging hundreds of moving parts for only a few. There are no spark plugs or engine motor oil to change or worry about.
 
Additionally, remote diagnostics will allow the Company to find issues with customer boats remotely, in real time. In many cases, our service team will be able to provide an OTA update to resolve the issue without the customer’s boat ever leaving the customer’s sight. Our mission will be to make the servicing of our products as simple as possible by connecting to and utilizing the diagnostics technology in every Forza X1 boat. Whether a customer needs maintenance or needs repairs, we intend to provide convenient and comprehensive service and warranty coverage for our customers throughout the country.
 
Customers who lack Forza X1 service access through our network of mobile services vans and trucks will be able to utilize the traditional warranty claim process, which is standard throughout the recreational boat industry. In our case, a customer will contact us through our website or app and speak with our support and service department and provide them with details about the issues they are experiencing with their boat. If over-the-air updates to software or hardware are insufficient to solve the problems and FX1 customer experience and service center or mobile service van are not within range of the customer, our support and service department will provide assistance.
 
In the case of a covered warrantable issue, our support and service department will put them in contact with a local partnered boat repair service technicians or arrange transportation of the boat to one of our partnered marinas and service centers. If none are available in a customer’s area, our support and service department would instruct the customer to obtain a quote for the covered warranty repair work and labor at a marine service center of their choosing. They would transmit the quote for the necessary repair work to our support and service department for approval. Once approved, the work is completed on the covered warrantable repairs, and we will pay the marine service center directly.
 
There may be instances where the customer’s issue is too technical for a traditional marine service center (e.g., issues related to the EV components of the boat). In such cases, our support and service department would coordinate with the customer to have the boat picked up on a trailer and towed to our manufacturing facility in Fort Pierce, Florida, for service.
 
If a customer contacts our support and service department for maintenance or an issue not covered under warranty, then our support and service department would be able to coordinate with them to arrange service with a mobile service van, partnered boat repair technician, or partnered marina or service center and the customer will be responsible for paying them directly.
 
We are still in the initial stages of establishing our service plans. We are in the process of identifying potential marinas, service centers, and technicians we would like to form strategic relationships with to ensure that we have a comprehensive service support system in place when our FX1 boats are sold. Although we are planning to eventually internalize most aspects of boat warranty and service through our mobile service vans and trucks over time, initially, we plan to operate them within 500 miles of the Forza X1 factory and partner with third parties elsewhere to enable nationwide coverage for our customers’ boat service and warranty repair needs.
 
Competition
 
The performance sport boat category and the powerboat industry as a whole are highly competitive for consumers and dealers. We also compete against consumer demand for used boats. Competition affects our ability to succeed in both the markets we currently plan to serve and new markets that we may enter in the future. Competition is based primarily on brand name, price, product selection, and product performance. We will compete with several large manufacturers that may have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do and who are represented by dealers in the markets in which we now operate and into which we plan to expand. We also will compete with a variety of small, independent manufacturers. We cannot assure you that we will not face greater competition from existing large or small manufacturers or that we will be able to compete successfully with new competitors. Our failure to compete effectively with our current and future competitors would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We also compete with other leisure activities. Our boats are not necessities and in times of economic hardship, consumers may cease purchasing non-essential items. Luxury items may not be used for recreational and sport purposes, and demand for our boats may be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ leisure time and by changes in consumer lifestyle, usage pattern or taste.

We also face competition for employees. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric boats is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business and prospects.
 
For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our industry is characterized by intense competition, which affects our sales and profits” and “If we fail to manage future growth effectively, we may not be able to market or sell our products successfully.”
 
Environmental and Safety Matters
 
Certain materials used in our manufacturing, including the resins used in production of our boats, are toxic, flammable, corrosive or reactive and are classified by the federal and state governments as “hazardous materials.” Control of these substances is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, and state pollution control agencies. The United States Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and corresponding state and provincial rules regulate emissions of air pollutants. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, standards limit the amount of emissions to which an employee may be exposed without the need for respiratory protection or upgraded plant ventilation. Twin Vee’s facilities are, and our future factory will be, regularly inspected by OSHA and by state and local inspection agencies and departments. We believe that Twin Vee’s facilities comply in all material aspects with these regulations. Although we anticipate that once our factory is built, we will incur capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws, we do not currently anticipate incurring any material expenditure in order to comply with environmental or safety regulations in connection with our future manufacturing facility.
 
Powerboats sold in the United States must be manufactured to meet the standards of certification required by the United States Coast Guard. In addition, boats manufactured for sale in the European Community must be certified to meet the European Community’s imported manufactured products standards. These certifications specify standards for the design and construction of powerboats. We believe that all of our boats will meet these standards. In addition, safety of recreational boats is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. Twin Vee has instituted recalls for defective component parts produced by certain of its third-party suppliers. None of Twin Vee’s recalls has had a material adverse effect on it. We expect to begin production of our two FX1 electric boats and commence selling to end user customers by late 2023. Once we have commenced production of our electric boats, we intend to institute recalls for any defective component parts produced by our third-party suppliers.
 
If we are not able to pass these additional costs along to our customers, it may have a negative impact on our business and financial condition.
 
State Dealership and Servicing Regulations
 
We intend to comply with specific state regulations, if any, regarding boat dealerships and servicing when we establish our direct-to-consumer sales and service model. While there are limitations on the ability of a motor vehicle manufacturer to act as its own dealer to provide direct sales in many states, these limitations generally do not apply to boat manufacturers.
 
We will investigate each state’s laws before our products become available for purchase in that jurisdiction. To determine how the laws would apply to our business would require fact-specific analysis of numerous factors of business in the state, including whether we have a physical presence or employees, whether we advertise or conduct other marketing activities, how sale transactions are structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state prohibits boat manufacturers from acting as dealers or servicing boats.
 
We plan to establish direct-to-consumer sales in those states where we are permitted to engage in direct-sales of our products. Moreover, in states where the law is unclear or prohibitive of direct sales, we intend to work with the governments of those states to carve out an exception for the sale of zero emission boats that are not available at other dealers within the state and use OneWater sites, where applicable, for the purpose of selling, delivering and servicing our boats within that particular state.
 
As a result, we may not be able to sell to customers in each state in the United States or provide service from a location in every state.
 
Employees/Human Capital
 
We believe we maintain excellent relations with our employees. As of March 20, 2023, we employed sixteen people as full-time employees, these employees are provided additional administrative support from Twin Vee. We also work with a variety of third-party consultants, including naval architects, electrical engineers, prototype professionals and procurement professionals. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transition Services Agreement.”

Corporate Information
 
Our principal executive office is located at 3101 S. US-1, Ft. Pierce, Florida 34982, and our telephone number is 772-202-8039. We maintain our corporate website at www.forzax1.com. Investors should not rely on any such information in deciding whether to purchase our common stock.
 
Forza X1, Inc. was initially incorporated as Electra Power Sports, Inc. on October 15, 2021, but we subsequently changed our name to Forza X1, Inc. on October 29, 2021. Our majority shareholder was incorporated in the State of Florida as Twin Vee Catamarans, Inc. on December 1, 2009, and reincorporated in Delaware on April 7, 2021, as Twin Vee PowerCats Co.
 
On July 22, 2022, our Board and our sole stockholders approved a forward split that was effected on July 22, 2022 at a ratio of 1.076923077:1, such that after the forward split our outstanding shares of common stock increased to 7,000,000 shares of common stock.
 
Facilities
 
We currently share our corporate headquarters located at 3101 US Highway 1, Fort Pierce, Florida, 34982 with Twin Vee. Twin Vee’s parent company, Twin Vee PowerCats, Inc., leases the facility from Visconti Holdings, LLC, (“Visconti Holdings”) an entity owned and controlled by our Executive Chairman and Chief of Product Development, Joseph Visconti pursuant to a lease agreement (the “Lease Agreement”), dated January 1, 2020, by and among the Company, Visconti Holdings, LLC and Twin Vee PowerCats, Inc. The Lease Agreement currently has a 5-year term, with an option to renew for an additional 5-year term. Twin Vee PowerCats, Co., currently pays Visconti Holdings $26,500 per month plus applicable sales and use tax, which is currently 7% in St. Lucie County. While we believe these headquarters are adequate for our current operations and needs, we do believe that the capacity at the facility will not be sufficient to support both our full-scale production and Twin Vee’s full-scale production. We are currently in negotiations for a new site to build the Forza factory. We are currently designing a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant to be built on a new parcel of land as our future boat manufacturing facility. The parcel of land to be acquired and the manufacturing facility to be built on such property will be owned by us, and not Twin Vee. In October of 2022, we signed a two-year lease agreement, on a 8,800 square foot warehouse facility in Old Fort, North Carolina to begin building out our prototype engines. The monthly base rent will be $7,517 the first year, including taxes and common area maintenance, the lease required a $7,517 security deposit. The bases rent will increase three (3%) on the anniversary of the annual term. See “Forza FX1 Future Factory.”
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and therefore we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including not being required to have our internal controls over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments. We may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year: (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (the “IPO”); (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion; or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with that term in the JOBS Act.
