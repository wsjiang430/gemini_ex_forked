These e-commerce venues form an effective global network serving thousands of consumers, enterprises, and governments. We are actively pursuing distribution, marketing and license arrangements and joint ventures with companies that could distribute their products through our e-commerce platform. We may also seek to joint venture with or purchase part or all of businesses that manufacture or distribute products, particularly those that we believe we could market through our e-commerce platform, as well as business that could enhance our e-commerce platform. As part of our efforts to enhance our e-commerce platform we have also begun the design and development of a next generation platform for digital assets built for Web3 (an internet service built using decentralized blockchains). This new platform (“NextPlat Digital”) will enable the use of a range of digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), in e-commerce and in community-building activities.

Recent Investments in Progressive Care Inc.
 
During 2022, with a view to enhancing our product and services offerings, we invested in securities issued by Progressive Care Inc. Progressive Care Inc. (OTCQB: RXMD) (“Progressive”) is a Florida health services organization and provider of Third-Party Administration (TPA), data management, COVID-19 related diagnostics and vaccinations, 340B contracted pharmacy services, prescription pharmaceuticals, compounded medications, provider of tele-pharmacy services, the sale of anti-retroviral medications, medication therapy management (MTM), the supply of prescription medications to long-term care facilities, and health practice risk management. Our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Charles Fernandez, was appointed as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Progressive in November 2022 along with our Board member, Mr. Rodney Barreto, who was appointed to serve as Vice Chairman of Progressive’s board of directors. Our holdings in Progressive include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and convertible debt, and we currently account for it on the equity method. In addition, we have extended an equity line of credit to Progressive. Through conversion of our convertible debt and warrants as well as via securities issuances that would result from utilization of the equity line of credit, we are able to own more than 50% of the voting equity securities of Progressive should we choose to do so. We have determined to use our ownership of the above securities to assert significant influence over Progressive Care, and we are in the process of assessing whether we should take steps to obtain further control of Progressive and/or integrate Progressive’s business with our own; or whether we should maintain it as a separate business.
Communications Products and Services
 
Through our legacy Global Telesat Communications Ltd and Orbital Satcom Corp business units, we provide Mobile Satellite Services (“MSS”) solutions to fulfill the growing global demand for satellite-enabled voice, data, personnel and asset tracking, Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity services. We provide these solutions for businesses, governments, military, humanitarian organizations, and individual users, enabling them to communicate, connect to the internet, track and monitor remote assets and lone workers, or request SOS assistance via satellite from almost anywhere in the world, even in the most remote and hostile of environments. As we proceed to grow and enhance our e-commerce business and product offerings, we will consider whether we should retain our Global Telesat Communications Ltd and Orbital Satcom Corp business units, or whether we should sell or spin them off.
 
We provide voice, data communications, IoT and M2M services via Geostationary and Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) satellite constellations and offer reliable connectivity in areas where terrestrial wireless or wireline networks do not exist or are limited, including remote land areas, open ocean, airways, the polar regions and regions where terrestrial networks are not operational, for example due to political conflicts and natural or man-made disasters.
 
We have expertise and long-term experience in providing tracking and monitoring services via satellite, specifically through the Globalstar Low Earth Orbit satellite network. We own unique network infrastructure devices, known as appliqués, which are in various Globalstar ground stations around the world and provide the signal receipt and processing technology that enables and powers the Globalstar simplex data service. Our ownership of these appliqués provides us with competitive access to the global simplex data service which addresses the market demand for a small and cost-effective solution for sending data, such as geographic coordinates, from assets or individuals in remote locations to a central monitoring station and is used in numerous applications such as tracking vehicles, asset shipments, livestock, and monitoring unattended remote assets. In addition, we also provide tracking and monitoring solutions using Automatic Identification System (AIS), 2G-5G, Push-to-Talk and two-way radio technology.
 
We generate revenue from both the provision of services and the sale of equipment. Higher margin recurring service revenue from the sale of monthly, annual, and prepaid airtime or messaging plans has historically represented an increasing proportion of our revenue, and we expect that trend to continue as we introduce new products requiring associated airtime or messaging plans.
 
We provide our products and services directly to end users and reseller networks located both in the United States and internationally through our subsidiaries, U.S. based Orbital Satcom Corp (“Orbital Satcom”) and U.K. based Global Telesat Communications Limited (“GTC”). We have a physical presence in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as an ecommerce storefront presence in 18 countries across 5 continents. We have a diverse geographical customer base having provided solutions to more than 50,000 customers located in more than 165 countries across most every continent in the world.

MSS Products
 
Our MSS products rely on satellite networks for voice, data and tracking connectivity and thus are not reliant on cell towers or other local infrastructure. As a result, our MSS solutions are suitable for recreational travelers and adventurers, government and military users, and corporations and individuals wishing to communicate or connect to the internet from remote locations, or in the event of an emergency such as a power outage, following a hurricane or other natural disaster during which regular cell phone, telephone and internet service may not be available.
 
Our satellite communications products enable users to make voice calls, send and receive text messages and emails, and transmit GPS location coordinates from virtually anywhere on the planet, no matter how remote the location and regardless of the availability of local communication infrastructure. Our range of satellite data products allows users around the world to connect to the internet, stream live video, and communicate via voice and data applications.
 
We are a provider of GPS enabled emergency locator distress beacons that can save lives, on land and at sea. Our distress beacons enable essential communication between our customers and search and rescue organizations during emergency situations and pinpoint locational information to Search and Rescue services, essential during an emergency.
 
We provide a wide range of satellite tracking devices used to monitor the location, movements, and history of almost anything that moves. We specialize in offering satellite tracking services through the Globalstar satellite network and have supplied tens of thousands of tracking devices which are used around the world to locate lone workers, track shipping containers, livestock, vehicles, and vessels along with many other types of assets.
 
The first product launched by the Company, SolarTrack, is a compact, lightweight, IoT tracking device powered by the sun and operating on one of the most modern satellite networks in the world. It is designed for tracking and monitoring anything that moves, or any remote asset used outdoors, almost anywhere in the world and we anticipate strong demand from customers looking for a low cost, low maintenance tracking device to monitor remote assets.
 
Mapping and Tracking Portal
 
Our advanced subscription-based mapping and tracking portal, GTCTrack, is available for use by registered customers who pay a monthly fee to access it. This mapping portal provides a universal and hardware-agnostic, cloud-based data visualization and management platform that allows managers to track, command, and control assets in near-real-time. Asset location reports including position, speed, altitude, heading and past location and movement history reports for a wide range of tracking devices and other products sold by us are available through GTCTrack.
 
Online Storefronts and E-Commerce Platforms
 
We operate two e-commerce websites offering a range of MSS products and solutions through our subsidiaries, Orbital Satcom, which targets customers in North and South America, and GTC which targets customers in the UK, EU, Middle East, Asia and the rest of the world. These websites produce sales and attract enquiries from customers and potential customers from all around the world. Over the long term, we plan to develop additional country-specific websites to target customers in South America, Asia and Europe where we anticipate there will be substantial further demand for our products.

In addition to our two main e-commerce websites, we make portable satellite voice, data and tracking solutions easier to find and buy online through our various third-party e-commerce storefronts such as Alibaba, Amazon, OnBuy and Walmart. We currently operate 25 storefronts across various countries on 5 continents. We have invested in personnel to translate our listings correctly in the different countries we are represented in and intend to regularly improve and increase our listings on all e-commerce sites. We currently have more than 10,000 product listings on all third-party sites and invest significantly in inventory to hold at Amazon’s various fulfillment centers around the world to ensure that orders are shipped to customers as quickly as possible. The products include handheld satellite phones, personal and asset tracking devices, portable high-speed broadband terminals, and satellite Wi-Fi hotspots. Our Amazon online marketplaces represented approximately 54.3% and 63.6% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively and we anticipate that these marketplaces will continue to represent a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. Our e-commerce storefronts enable us to attract a significantly diversified level of sales from all over the world, ensuring we are not overly reliant on any single market or sector for our sales revenue. Furthermore, many products we sell require subscription-based services which allow us to increase our recurring revenue airtime sales.
 
With consumer behavior drastically changing because of COVID-19, e-commerce traffic witnessed double-digit gains in 2021 and 2020, respectively, as stores closed, and shoppers used digital options. This significant change in consumer shopping habits resulted in a substantial increase of U.S., EU and U.K. consumers electing to shop online. Starting in 2021, senior management of the Company invested in a comprehensive systems upgrade project with the goal of building a state-of-the-art e-commerce platform. This implementation is substantially complete, and the Company is collaborating with businesses to optimize their ability to sell their goods online, domestically, and internationally, enabling customers and partners to optimize their e-commerce presence and revenue.
 
Expanding beyond our current global network of online storefronts serving thousands of consumers, enterprises, and governments, we are developing a next generation platform for digital assets built for Web3.NextPlat Digital which has been designed and developed in collaboration with consultants and contracted developers, will enable a range of digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), in e-commerce and in community-building activities. As currently contemplated, NextPlat Digital will facilitate the creation/minting, purchase and sale of a broad range of NFT products, including, but not limited to, art, music, collectables, digital real estate, video games and game items. NextPlat Digital will be used to create both (a) public marketplaces, for us and third parties, where anyone with a crypto wallet can buy and sell their own NFTs, and (b) private marketplaces that only allow a particular company or entity to sell their own NFTs (such as for the promotion of a particular brand or product).
 
Industry and Market
 
We compete in the mobile satellite products and services sector of the global communications industry. The products and airtime that we sell are intended to meet users’ needs for connectivity in all locations where existing terrestrial wireline and wireless communications networks do not exist, do not provide sufficient coverage, or are impaired. Government organizations, including military and intelligence agencies and disaster response agencies, non-governmental organizations and industrial operations and support teams depend on mobile voice and data satellite communications products and services on a regular basis. Businesses with global operations require reliable communications services when operating in remote locations around the world. Mobile satellite services users span many sectors, including emergency services, maritime, aviation, government, utilities, oil and gas, mining, recreation, forestry, heavy equipment, construction, and transportation, among others. We believe many of our customers view satellite communications products and services as critical to their daily operations.
 
There is we believe a fast growing, multi-billion-dollar global market for a small and cost-effective solution for receiving and processing mobile voice and data communications from remote locations used in applications such as tracking vehicles or asset shipments, monitoring unattended remote assets or mobile security. Over the past two decades, the global mobile satellite services market has experienced significant growth. Increasingly, better-tailored, improved-technology products and services are creating new channels of demand for mobile satellite services. Growth in demand for mobile satellite voice services is driven by the declining cost of these services, the diminishing size and lower costs of the devices, as well as heightened demand by governments, businesses and individuals for ubiquitous global voice and data coverage. We believe our solutions are ideally suited for industries such as maritime, aviation, government/military, emergency/humanitarian services, mining, forestry, oil and gas, heavy equipment, transportation and utilities, as well as recreational users. We do not tailor our products and services to different types of customers as in our experience military, non-profit, government and recreational users tend to purchase the same types of products and services.

Competition
 
The global satellite communications industry is highly competitive. In certain regions, such as North America, we currently face substantial competition from other service providers that offer a range of mobile and fixed communications options. In other regions, such as the UK and EU, we have a strong presence and are one of the leading providers of satellite communicators, emergency locator beacons and satellite tracking devices. We compete primarily on the basis of coverage, quality, portability, pricing and in the case of our e-commerce storefronts, availability of services and products.
 
The competitors for our satellite telecommunications services and products are other resellers of leading satellite networks such as Iridium, Inmarsat, Thuraya and Globalstar, some of which are also our suppliers. We expect the competition for our satellite telecommunications services and our satellite tracking and monitoring services to increase significantly as market demand accelerates.
 
We believe that we are well positioned to compete for the satellite telecommunications services business largely on a cost basis and our global e-commerce presence, which makes products more accessible to buy as compared to more traditional methods of purchasing e.g., bricks and mortar storefronts.
 
Our competitive strengths
 
We believe that the following strengths contribute to our success:
 

● | Our global presence enables us to compete in various markets around the world, with our multi-lingual personnel allowing us to respond to global customer inquiries with 24/7/365 customer support. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our significant expertise in global e-commerce sales allows us to maintain a competitive advantage over traditional methods of purchase through “brick and mortar” stores. 
● | Our significant levels of inventory stored in fulfillment centers around the world enable us to quickly secure customer orders against competitors who may not hold available inventory. 
● | Economies of scale of a leading provider of MSS product allows us to offer competitive prices for our products. 
● | Long-term contracts and experience with Globalstar allow us to compete competitively on satellite tracking opportunities. 
● | A diverse customer base with no single customer representing more than 3.0% of our annual gross sales revenue, and no single country representing more than 33% of our gross annual sales revenue as of December 31, 2022. This diversification reasonably permits the Company not to rely on any single customer, or group of customers, on any single product line, or any specific geographic area. Our Amazon sales represent the majority of our sales effort in the last 24 months. 

 
Our business strategy
 
We intend to achieve our mission and further grow our business by pursuing the following strategies:
 

● | Increased product offerings - we are constantly increasing our product lines and offerings and will continue to do so in the future. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Marketplace expansion – We intend to open new global e-commerce storefronts around the world to develop sales in new markets.

● | Government sourced revenue - We intend to target US government/GSA sales which have not historically represented a significant part of our sales revenue. We will also recruit experienced government sales professionals to assist with this plan. We plan to become an approved seller on the US Government’s GSA Schedule, which gives federal, and in some cases state and local buyers, access to a great number of commercial products and services at negotiated ceiling prices. Schedule purchases represent approximately 21% of overall federal procurement spending. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Product innovation - We will continue to launch our own innovative branded products, such as our SolarTrack solar powered satellite tracking device, to differentiate us and gain a competitive edge over other MSS suppliers. 
● | Future acquisitions - We will seek suitable acquisition opportunities to further increase our scale, expand sales and access new markets and sectors. 
● | E-Commerce Platforms - Expanding beyond our current global network of online storefronts serving thousands of consumers, enterprises, and governments, we intend to develop a next generation platform for digital assets built for Web3. Our new platform, which is currently in the design and development phase in collaboration with consultants and contracted developers, will enable the use of a range of digital assets, including NFTs, in e-commerce and in community-building activities. 

Intellectual Property
 
Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to maintain our trade secrets. All of our employees and consultants are subject to non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights.
Regulatory Matters
 
Government contract laws and regulations affect how we will do business with our customers, and in some instances, will impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, and the termination of any contracts, or the inability to bid on future contracts. We intend our Orbital Satcom subsidiary to become qualified as a government contractor. Our products may also be subject to regulation by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Communications Commission that regulate wireless communications.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 18 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee.
 
Sources and Availability of Components
 
Certain materials and equipment for our products are custom-made for those products and are dependent upon either a single or limited number of suppliers. A supplier failure could cause delays in product delivery if another supplier cannot be found promptly, or if the quality of such replacement supplier’s components is inferior or unacceptable. As a result of COVID-19 and related supply chain constraints, we have experienced shortages in inventory due to manufacturing and logistical issues.
Our Risks and History of Losses
 
Our ability to achieve our mission and execute our strategies is subject to certain challenges, risks and uncertainties, including, among others:
 

● | Our ability to obtain sufficient funding to expand our business and respond to business opportunities 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our ability to acquire new customers or retain existing customers in a cost-effective manner 
● | Our ability to successfully improve our production efficiencies and economies of scale 
● | Our ability to manage our supply chain to continue to satisfy our future operation needs 
● | Our ability to retain our market share in our industry 

 
We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we have incurred net losses of $9.2 million, $8.1 million, and $2.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $31.1 million. We expect to incur additional losses prior to recording sufficient revenue from our operations as a result of the costs associated with expanding and seeking additional sources of revenue to our current revenue base.
