ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 
Overview
 
Kisses From Italy Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as “us,” “our,” “we,” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Florida on March 7, 2013, with a focus on developing a fast, casual food dining chain restaurant business.
 
The Company operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Kisses From Italy 9th LLC, Kisses From Italy-Franchising LLC, Kisses From Italy, Inc. (Canada) (a company incorporated under the laws of Canada and registered in Quebec on December 23, 2020), and Kisses From Italy Italia SRLS (a limited liability company incorporated in Italy), and its 70% owned subsidiary, Kisses-Palm Sea Royal LLC.
 
We commenced operations by opening our initial corporate-owned restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in May 2015. By April 2016, we opened three additional restaurants located in various Wyndham Hotel properties in the Pompano Beach, Florida area. In September 2017, Hurricane Irma caused significant damage to the area, which resulted in Wyndham halting operations at its hotel properties for repairs and renovations and the closure of our Wyndham hotel locations. In December 2017, we vacated one of our restaurants in the Wyndham Hotel properties due to damage from the hurricane and have not re-opened such restaurant. During the first half of 2021, we consolidated the remaining two Wyndham stores into one location.
 
While our Fort Lauderdale location was reopened in early November 2017, we were only able to reopen two of the hotel locations in Pompano Beach in late January 2018. We also elected not to reopen our fourth location, as the damages were too excessive. If we can raise additional capital, of which there is no assurance, we intend to own and operate up to 10 restaurants and utilize them as a showcase in the marketing of our proposed franchise operations.
 
In May 2017, we completed our National Franchise License which permits us to sell franchises in all of the states in the United States except for New York, Virginia, and Maryland, which licenses we hope to obtain if sufficient demand exists in the future.
 
We opened our first European location in Ceglie del Campo, Bari, Italy, in October 2019. The Bari location closed in April 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, briefly re-opened and has not re-opened as of the date of this Report. Such location was intended to serve as the distribution center for products for European locations, as well as to be used as a training facility for European franchises. However, this initiative has been severely curtailed due to the onset and lingering impact of Covid -19 in Europe.
 
Our two corporate-owned restaurants, one located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and one within the Wyndham location in Pompano Beach, Florida, have fully re-opened without limitation or any social distancing requirement.
 
In September 2019, the Company's common stock was approved for trading by FINRA and in October 2019 was approved for uplisting by the OTC Markets Group to the OTCQB under the symbol “KITL”.

In June of 2020, the Company entered into a multi-unit development agreement (the “Development Agreement”) pursuant to which it granted development rights to Demasar Management, Inc. (“Demasar”) to open and operate up to 100 restaurants in Canada. Under this Development Agreement, the developer is obligated to open a minimum of 20 restaurants by June 17, 2025. On November 20, 2021, we opened a franchise location under the Development Agreement in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Company expects to generate franchise fees from its franchise locations once the franchises become established.
 
In September of 2020, we entered retail food and grocery stores with Kisses From Italy branded products in Canada. The product launch began in November of 2020 and Kisses From Italy branded products were in nine retail stores by the end of 2020. Currently, Kisses From Italy branded products are in 40 stores across Ontario and Quebec, Canada.
 
In April of 2021, we entered into a Consulting Agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with Fransmart, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Fransmart”), pursuant to which we engaged Fransmart as our exclusive global franchise developer and representative for a period of ten years.

On March 9, 2022, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of its authorized common stock from 200,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares. Such action was approved by the Board of Directors on January 25, 2022 and a majority of the Company’s shareholders on January 27, 2022. The purpose of the share increase was to make available additional shares of common stock to meet the current obligations of the Company to issue common stock, including under outstanding convertible securities.

For as long as the Note is outstanding, the Company must have authorized and reserved, free of preemptive rights, six times the number of shares issuable upon full conversion of the Note (initially 25,846,153 shares), subject to the 4.99% beneficial ownership limitation.
 
The Company entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement, effective as of March 1, 2023 (the “SAA”), with SC Culinary LLC, a New York limited liability company (“SC Culinary”).
 
SC Culinary is currently the creator and owner of, and in possession of, a quick-service food concept (the “Concept”) and is developing and will develop all intellectual property rights related to the Concept (the “Intellectual Property Rights”), all of which were or will be developed or acquired by SC Culinary, independently, or assigned to it by Scott Conant.

Pursuant to the SAA, SC Culinary will license its interest in the Concept, the Intellectual Property Rights, and the NIL Rights (collectively, the “License”) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to be established (the “Subsidiary”) for the purpose of developing the Concept into the business of the Subsidiary (the “Brand”).
 
In consideration for the use of the License under the SAA, SC Culinary is entitled to receive certain minimum cash payments and restricted shares of common stock of the Company (the “Shares”) upon the achievement of certain milestones.

OUR STRATEGY
 
We strive to provide the highest level of service, high-quality ingredients, and products. Enveloped in our mission is our philosophy to support and partner with local producers and suppliers within the regions in order to provide a truly authentic experience to our customers. Our vision is to leverage the success of our flagship store and our initial hotel locations in the South Florida market and to expand into other regions on a local, state, national, and global level. The main focus is doing so through our continued corporate-owned store expansion, along with the development and sales of additional locations through the advancement of our franchise and territorial rights program.
Our Menu
 
Our menu includes grilled paninis including an Italian style Panini, sausage, beef, sliced pork, or chicken topped with quality natural “sott'olio” (grilled and marinated vegetable) products at prices ranging from $5.95 to $7.95. We also offer deli paninis including fresh cheese Panini, prosciutto, salami, capocollo, bresaola, and turkey panini’s ranging in price from $5.95 to $7.95. All our panini’s include lettuce, tomato, and one choice of cheese and three choices of marinated vegetables, or three choices of grilled vegetables.
 
We also offer desserts including a Nutella sandwich, a variety of fresh Danish, cannoli, Italian biscotti, sfogliatelle or a corneti, ranging in price from $1.50 to $2.50. Our breakfast menu is served all day We also have a full coffee and tea favorites, including espresso, cappuccino, and other coffee drinks, soft drinks, bottled water, and juices, as well as various flavors of granite (ices).
 
Our vision is to transport true authentic and rustic taste from the provinces of Italy through our menu items. We intend to offer products that will cater to all diets, including gluten-free diets and emphasize fresh products with no preservatives.
 
All our sott'olio and coffee products are made in Italy. Our management is in constant communication with our product manufacturers and search for high quality and authentic products from different regions from Southern Italy including Sicily, Calabria, Puglia, Napoli, Potenza, and Toscana. Ensuring freshness and quality, our representatives work closely with local farmers and ranchers for all meats and fresh vegetables. All our products are D.O.P. (Protected Designation of Origin) certified and defined in the European Commission Regulations. 
 
Quick Service Restaurants
 
Our initial restaurant is located at 3146 NE 9th Street in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This location is across the street from an Atlantic Ocean public beach and consists of approximately 1,000 square feet of a retail restaurant with seating for up to 25 guests. Subsequently, we opened three additional similar restaurants, all in Southern Florida.
 
Except for the Fort Lauderdale location, all of our restaurant locations arose out of a relationship we established with Wyndham Vacation Ownership, Inc., which operates timeshare apartment complexes. Of our three restaurants, two are located in Wyndham timeshare resort properties where they are the only restaurants on site. Our lease agreements provide for our restaurants to provide room service that can be charged to the customer’s room, as well as an opportunity to provide food and beverage service to various sales, orientations, marketing, and owner events held by Wyndham regularly on these properties. Wyndham remits payments for these services bi-weekly and charges us with a 5% administrative fee for processing costs.
 
Each location is managed by one senior employee/manager and individually assessed based on foot traffic, seasonality, and other demographic factors. Our U.S. locations abide by the standards and rules set forth by the State of Florida Department of Health, and our Italian location abides by the standards and rules set forth by Italy’s Ministry of Health and the Puglia (Apulia) region’s legislative/administrative authority. Michele Di Turi, our CEO, possesses the Certified Food Manager accreditation and has the proper authority to provide necessary food safety courses.

Restaurant Franchising
 
In addition to opening our company-owned restaurants, we are engaged in franchising our restaurant concept so that we can build market share and brand awareness. In May 2017, we completed our National Franchise License which permits us to sell franchises in all of the states in the United States except for New York, Virginia, and Maryland which we intend to add at later dates if sufficient demand exists. On June 23, 2017, we completed the sale of our initial two Florida franchises at a price of $15,000 per location. These locations are set to be developed at a later date. In June 2021 and November 2021 the Company opened its first two franchise locations in Chino, California and Montreal, Canada, respectively. Due to the onset of Covid-19 the Company has temporarily waived any franchise fees at both locations so that the franchisees could establish operations at each of those locations.
 
In June 2020, the Company entered into the Development Agreement pursuant to which it granted development rights to Demasar to open and operate up to 100 restaurants in Canada. Demasar will be taking the lead for franchise expansion and assisting in the Canadian brand building for the Kisses From Italy brand.
 
Each of our franchise restaurants are required to conform to a standard of interior design, featuring a distinctive and comfortable Italian décor. Our prior approval is required for each specific location of a proposed franchise restaurant, which includes a requirement that the same be in a clearly identifiable commercial location built out in accordance with our standards. Franchisees are also required to satisfactorily complete training and purchase certain equipment and supplies from us and other approved suppliers. We also require the purchase of a point-of-sale system and data polling services from a specified supplier and a computer system that meets established system standards.
 
Franchisees will be required to purchase approximately 90% to 95% of their supplies and food inventory either directly from us, or from approved suppliers. We attempt to negotiate system-wide volume discounts and/or rebates for our franchisees from approved suppliers and if successful, pass such discounts and/or rebates on to franchisees based on the volume of their purchases from the suppliers providing the discounts.
 
Our franchise agreement with franchisees also requires our franchisee to pay royalties of 9% of gross sales, which are defined to be total actual charges for all products (food and non-food) and services, such as catering and delivery, sold to customers, exclusive of taxes, every week. We retain 6% of this royalty and the remaining 3% goes towards a marketing fund. The marketing fund is broken down in two parts, 2% for local marketing and 1% for national marketing. We anticipate that until national coverage is warranted, local and/or regional marketing campaigns will be implemented.
 
We also require that our franchisee enter into a collateral assignment and assumption of lease through which we are granted a security interest in all of the furniture, removable trade fixtures, inventory, licenses, and supplies located in the restaurant as collateral for (1) the payment of any obligation owed to us, (2) any default or breach under the terms of the lease, and (3) any default or breach of any of the terms and provisions of the franchise agreement. In the event of a breach of or default under the lease or payment by a franchisee as a result of a breach or default, we may be entitled to possession of the restaurant and all of our rights, title, and interest in and to the lease. We also enter into a conditional assignment of telephone numbers and listings that assigns us telephone numbers and directory listings upon termination or expiration of a franchise relationship.
 
The initial term of a franchise agreement is ten years, with a renewal provision of between 2-5 years on the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement so long as there has been substantial compliance with the franchise agreement and pay a to-be-determined fee for each renewal.

Franchisees are also required to replace any franchise that terminates or expires or any restaurant that closes within the territory if necessary, to maintain the number of our named restaurants required in the development schedule. If a franchisee fails to meet the development schedule, we have the right to terminate the franchise agreement or adjust that territory to eliminate any state in the territory where they have not achieved the minimum number of restaurants required for that state.
 
We are required to perform the following services:
 

· | Solicitation of new franchise owners - Actively and continuously market and promote through advertising and solicit prospective franchise owners in their territory according to an annual plan and budget that a franchisee develops and submits for our approval. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Develop and maintain relationships with landlords for purposes of obtaining sites for restaurants and coordinating efforts with franchise owners to lease such sites. Develop relationships with landlords, contractors, equipment suppliers, and service providers in the territory and assist in the supervision of the build-out for the restaurants in our territory.

· | Training - Provide all initial training to the franchise owners, as well as supplemental and refresher training at our training restaurant. Schedule and coordinate all training of all franchise owners with our required mode of operations.

Provide franchise owners with supervisory assistance and guidance in connection with the opening and initial operations of their restaurants. Provide pre-opening and post-opening assistance for each new restaurant. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Monitoring, audit, and inspection - Be responsible for at least monthly monitoring of the operation of their restaurants, including monitoring and reporting of the sales volume and other data as determined from time to time. Monitor and communicate to our franchisee the marketing efforts of our restaurants. Conduct or assist franchisees with inspecting or auditing restaurants and their owners, with visits no less than monthly and in-depth reports at least quarterly. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Vendors and suppliers - Notify vendors and, if necessary, locate new vendors for the franchises and coordinate distribution and purchasing programs. Assist franchisees in developing programs for suppliers and distributors of approved products. Maintain positive relationships and evaluate additional incentive programs and marketing programs from approved and preferred suppliers, vendors, and other designated parties. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continuing assistance to franchise owners - Provide continuing operating assistance and assist in facilitating transfers and renewals of franchises. Assist franchise owners during transfers of their franchises or restaurants. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We also require our franchisees to maintain certain staffing levels. For the first development year, we require each location to have 2 corporate employees, increasing to 3 in the fifth development year.
 
If a franchisee fails to perform services and we need to assume such tasks, we require that they pay us an amount equal to 125% of the expenditures incurred by us. and we have the right to terminate the agreement after notice of a 30-day cure period.
 
Each franchisee must refer all inquiries for franchises in their territory to us. Under the terms of an Area Representative Agreement, we have the sole right to grant franchises in all our unsold territories, terminate a franchise agreement, and approve site selections, leases, and other franchise real estate transactions.
 
Franchise Marketing
 
Our marketing strategy for establishing multi-unit franchises is to contact individuals or entities that have previously developed franchises in other concepts. This strategy allows us to find people with the proper knowledge, experience, and financial resources to develop a successful franchise operation in a timely fashion.

We seek individuals or groups with the skills and financial strength to operate multi-unit franchise organizations within specific geographic territories.  We anticipate that a franchise territory will consist of areas that are either cities or counties depending on population. We seek to identify people with considerable experience in the management of food service venues who also have sufficient start-up capital to open several of our restaurants. We have entered into discussions with several possible franchise owners, however. we currently have no franchise agreements.
 
We will consider the skills and investment capital that each potential multiple franchise owner presents to determine the size and nature of the territory and the minimum number of our restaurants that the franchise owner will be required to maintain in the territory in order keep the exclusive rights to that territory. We will review the demographics of each proposed location to consider the appropriate number of restaurants in each area based upon population and other factors including per capita income and then set the minimum number of restaurants at half the amount. Franchisees will not be restricted from opening additional restaurants beyond the minimum for their territory. We have not yet generated revenue from the sourcing of franchises and there are no assurances we will ever generate revenues from this business concept.
 
Commissary System
 
We plan to develop centralized commissary facilities that will serve all of the restaurants that we own in a given region. We believe that a commissary that serves a region of restaurants will improve efficiency and consistency for the restaurant concept. We also believe that a commissary system will allow our restaurants to be approximately 500 square feet smaller than they would otherwise be. We plan to build commissaries in areas with lower rent. In this manner, we plan to save the difference between the 500 fewer square feet that retail rental space would cost and the commissary’s costs located in a lower-rent area. Our commissary will have storage space for paper products as well as walk-in coolers to store food. Food preparation for sauces, salad dressings, and other base ingredients will be done in the commissary “clean room” and then delivered to local restaurants daily. We believe central food preparation of sauces and base ingredients will maintain the consistency of our restaurants’ products and possibly reduce labor costs.
Restaurant Advertising
 
Our advertising has and will consist primarily of newspaper print ads, direct mailing efforts and also through social media, including Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets. We also participated in other forms of advertising. For example, we intend to use an airplane to advertise our Kisses banner to the Fort Lauderdale beach crowd, offering promotional free coffee and T-shirts. Our ads will contain a coupon for a free coffee with the purchase of any meal item.
 
As we open restaurants in new markets we plan to duplicate the advertising effort we employed in Fort Lauderdale and to spend initially approximately 2% to 3% of monthly revenue for local advertising on a per company-owned restaurant basis. Since we plan to build multiple restaurants simultaneously within a specific geographic region, we believe our advertising cost as a percentage of revenue will decrease as we increase the number of restaurants within a region. There are no assurances we will successfully open multiple restaurants in the future.
 
Employees
 
We currently employ 8 full-time persons, plus our officers. We do not have any part-time employees. Our employees work at will and are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe our relationship with our employees is excellent in most cases. We require all our employees and consultants to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Our success relies on our ability to hire additional employees, particularly on the local sales side. We believe there are numerous quality people to choose from throughout our area of targeted expansion.
 
As we grow we anticipate we will require a franchise director and a Chief Financial Officer/Controller, as well as various administrative support personnel.

Competition
 
The fast-food segment of the restaurant industry is highly competitive and fragmented. In addition, fast food restaurants compete against other segments of the restaurant industry, including fast-casual restaurants and casual dining restaurants. The number, size, and strength of our competitors vary by region. Our competitors also compete based on a number of factors, including taste, the speed of service, value, name recognition, restaurant location, and customer service.
 
The restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional, or local economic conditions; currency fluctuations; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number, and location of competing food retailers and products; and disposable purchasing power. Our restaurant concept is expected to compete with international, national, and regional restaurant chains as well as locally-owned restaurants. We will compete not only for customers, but also for management and hourly personnel, suitable real estate sites, and qualified franchisees.
 
We believe that each of the following restaurants may provide competition to our proposed restaurants because they all are franchise operations that sell sandwiches and coffee:
 

· | Jimmy John’s
--+-------------


· | Subway
--+-------


· | Chipotle Mexican Grill
--+-----------------------


· | Miami Subs Grill
--+-----------------


· | Starbucks
--+----------

 
Of the above-listed restaurants, all are larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we currently have available.
 
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to various federal, state, and local laws affecting our business. Our restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, sanitation, safety, and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. In addition, we must comply with various state laws that regulate the franchisor/franchisee relationship.
 
We are also subject to federal and state laws governing employment and pay practices, overtime, tip credits, and working conditions. The bulk of our employees are paid on an hourly basis at rates related to the federal and state minimum wages.
 
We are also subject to federal and state child labor laws which, among other things, prohibit the use of certain “hazardous equipment” by employees 18 years of age or younger. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, we could be required to expend funds to modify our restaurants to better provide service to, or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of disabled persons. We continue to monitor our facilities for compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act in order to conform to its requirements. We believe future expenditures for such compliance would not have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
As a potential franchisor, we will be soliciting prospects for franchises and are subject to federal and state laws pertaining to franchising. These laws require that certain information be provided to franchise prospects at certain times and regulate what can be said and done during the offering process. Some states require the franchise offering circular to be registered and renewed on an annual basis.
