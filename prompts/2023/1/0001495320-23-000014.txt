Item 1.        Business
Our Company
Vera Bradley, Inc. operates two unique lifestyle brands – Vera Bradley and Pura Vida. We believe Vera Bradley and Pura Vida are complementary businesses, both with devoted, emotionally-connected, and multi-generational female customer bases; alignment as casual, comfortable, affordable, and fun brands; positioning as “gifting” and socially-connected brands; strong, entrepreneurial cultures; a keen focus on community, charity, and social consciousness; multi-channel distribution strategies; and talented leadership teams aligned and committed to the long-term success of their brands.
In July 2019, Vera Bradley, Inc. acquired a 75% interest in Creative Genius, Inc., which operates under the name Pura Vida Bracelets (“Pura Vida”). Pura Vida results are consolidated within the Company’s financial statements beginning on July 17, 2019, the first full day following the acquisition. On January 30, 2023, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 25% interest in Pura Vida.
The Company has three reportable segments: Vera Bradley Direct (“VB Direct”), Vera Bradley Indirect (“VB Indirect”), and Pura Vida. For financial information about our reportable segments, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this report.
Our Brands
Vera Bradley 
Vera Bradley is a leading designer of women’s handbags, luggage and travel items, fashion and home accessories, and unique gifts. Founded in 1982 by friends Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia R. Miller, the brand is known for its innovative designs, iconic patterns, and brilliant colors that inspire and connect women. The reportable segments within the Vera Bradley brand are VB Direct and VB Indirect.
VB Direct. The VB Direct business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products through Vera Bradley full-line and factory outlet stores in the United States; e-commerce sites verabradley.com and verabradley.ca; the Vera Bradley online outlet site; and typically the Vera Bradley annual outlet sale in Fort Wayne, Indiana. As of January 28, 2023, the Company operated 51 full-line stores and 79 factory outlet stores. The annual outlet sale was cancelled in 2020, 2021, and 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but will resume in calendar 2023.
VB Indirect. The VB Indirect business consists of sales of Vera Bradley products to approximately 1,700 specialty retail locations, substantially all of which are located in the United States; sales to department stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators; and royalties recognized through licensing agreements related to the Vera Bradley brand.
Pura Vida
Pura Vida, based in La Jolla, California, is a digitally native lifestyle brand that we believe resonates with its loyal consumer following. The Pura Vida brand has a differentiated and expanding offering of bracelets, jewelry, apparel, and other lifestyle accessories. The Pura Vida segment represents revenues generated through the Pura Vida websites, www.puravidabracelets.com, www.puravidabracelets.eu, and www.puravidabracelets.ca and through the distribution of Pura Vida-branded products to wholesale retailers and department stores, substantially all of which are located in the United States, as well as through its five retail stores.
Our History
When they were traveling together in 1982, Fort Wayne, Indiana friends Barbara Bradley Baekgaard and Patricia Miller realized there was a lack of stylish travel accessories in the market. Within weeks, the friends created Vera Bradley, named after Ms. Bradley Baekgaard’s mother, and began manufacturing and marketing their distinctive products. The founders, together with past and present members of the executive management team, have been instrumental in our growth and success. 
The passion for design and customer service established by our founders has driven our Company for over 40 years and remains the cornerstone of Vera Bradley, Inc. today. Ms. Baekgaard retired from Vera Bradley operations in 2017 but continues to serve 
on the Board of Directors and as a brand ambassador. Ms. Miller retired in October 2012 as our National Spokesperson and in August 2019 from the Board of Directors.
In July 2019, Vera Bradley, Inc. acquired a majority interest in Pura Vida. On January 30, 2023, subsequent to the end of fiscal 2023, the Company acquired the remaining interest in Pura Vida.
Similar to the Vera Bradley brand, Pura Vida was founded by two friends, Griffin Thall and Paul Goodman. Thall and Goodman, from Southern California, were traveling through Costa Rica in 2010 and crossed paths with two bracelet artisans. Thall and Goodman asked the artisans to make 400 bracelets to take home with them. 
Upon returning to San Diego, Thall and Goodman placed the bracelets in a bowl at a local boutique. Within days, the bracelets sold out and customers were asking for more. Thall and Goodman quickly recognized the significance of these simple string bracelets. They were more than just ordinary locally-crafted bracelets; they symbolized a movement valuing the simple things in life. So, Pura Vida, which means “pure life” in Spanish and is a philosophy that encourages the appreciation of life’s simple treasures, was born.
We believe Pura Vida is a great strategic fit for Vera Bradley and that the two companies have combined to make Vera Bradley, Inc. a unique lifestyle company.
Enterprise Vision and Growth Strategies
We are committed to driving growth in our two lifestyle brands, generating strong cash flow, and returning capital to shareholders.
To drive long-term top-line and bottom-line growth, in fiscal 2024 we are embarking on Project Restoration and will focus on four key pillars – Consumer, Brand, Product, and Channel.
Vera Bradley
Consumer. We will focus on restoring brand relevancy, targeting the casual and feminine 35 to 54 year old woman who not only values fashion and style but also function. With this strategy we will also inspire and retain our loyal customers outside of this age group.
Brand. We will strategically market our distinctive and unique positioning as a colorful, feminine, fashionable brand that connects with consumers on a deep, emotional level.
We are continually looking for new ways to creatively engage our customers, grow brand awareness, and introduce new customers to our brands in a cost-effective manner, but that is becoming more challenging and expensive for both of our brands.
Vera Bradley’s marketing platform will continue to be a blend of digital and more traditional channels, such as direct mail, email, quality media placements, public relations, and targeted TV ads. Vera Bradley continues to rank among the top of the industry for our Net Promoter and Customer Satisfaction Scores.
Product. We will refocus on core product categories and items we are “best at” by innovating and expanding around our core products, We will elevate our colorful feminine heritage, keeping it distinctive but more trend relevant through updated print and design. We will innovate into strategic adjacent lifestyle item introductions that make sense for our customers. We will also continue to pursue collaborations and partnerships that align with our target customers.
In fiscal 2023, we launched our Featherweight collection, continued with product collaborations such as Disney, Harry Potter, and Crocs and introduced new partnerships with Star Wars, Coleman, Tupperware, and Totes. We also expanded our home assortment and added cloud slip-ons and mules to our VB footwear franchise in the fall and holiday seasons, as well as expanded our cozy, sleep, and outerwear collections. 
Channel. We will accelerate our digital-first focus and online presence through a mix of brand storytelling and product messaging. We will build a balanced footprint that more clearly differentiates full-line from factory stores, through differentiated pattern and color, product functionality, sustainably-sourced fabrics, and pricing. We will also target new or strengthen existing relationships with strategically-aligned wholesale partners.
In fiscal 2023, we continued to expand options for customers to shop, including enhancing our presence in third-party marketplaces and adding boutiques in select high-traffic airports. We opened five new factory stores and closed 20 underperforming retail stores.
Pura Vida
Consumer. We will sharpen our focus on the care-free 18-24 year old girl, who both those younger and older aspire to be. Our target customer is free-spirited, a trendsetter, and focused on “living her best life.” Pura Vida jewelry is a way of expressing herself and fits her personality.
Brand. We will refresh our brand image with a focus on showing what “living free” looks and feels like – showing real places, real moments, and real faces that are authentic, diverse, and inclusive. We will recenter our brand ethos on “living life to the fullest” as well as Pura Vida’s hallmark of supporting charities and social responsibility. 
Pura Vida remains one of the most highly-engaged brands in the accessories space, surpassing the 2.2 million mark of followers on Instagram and is consistently listed as one of the most engaged jewelry brands on Instagram. Pura Vida continued to rank among the top of the industry for our Net Promoter and Customer Satisfaction Scores.
In fiscal 2023, we began the process of implementing a comprehensive customer data platform to build a single, coherent, complete view of each Pura Vida customer so that we can better target and personalize marketing and become less reliant on third-party marketing. This project is scheduled for completion in the spring of fiscal 2024.
Product. We will focus on delivering unique, fun, playful product designs that are affordable and accessible. We will continue to deepen our expertise and innovate in our hero core category of string bracelets as well as other jewelry items, and we will opportunistically explore additional close-in, adjacent categories that make sense for our business and our customers.
In fiscal 2023, we continued collaborations with Disney, Harry Potter, Hello Kitty, and the World Surf League; partnered with key influencers; and offered themed-collections centered around key events such as Shark Week. We also launched our new demi-fine collection featuring 18 karat gold plating, sterling silver, and natural stones and expanded our assortment of engravable jewelry. 
Approximately a third of the total Pura Vida business is comprised of jewelry categories other than bracelets, such as rings, anklets, and necklaces.
Channel. We will have a strong focus on restoring e-commerce growth, utilizing our new comprehensive customer data platform to strategically target and personalize marketing. We will drive strategic growth of wholesale by pursuing larger, more strategic partnerships and expansion of our larger existing accounts. In addition, we will refine our store model to further drive top and bottom line growth. We are pausing new store growth in fiscal 2024 to determine how big our store base should be and what infrastructure is needed to support it.
We also opened three additional full-line locations, building on the success of our first store opening in San Diego, California in August 2021. Our four full-line stores are playing a role in driving new customer acquisition as we continue to diversify our marketing platforms, and they demonstrate the power a retail presence can have in driving digital sales, omni-channel loyalty, and spending.
Our Product Release Strategy
Vera Bradley. We typically introduce new collections monthly. Each launch typically consists of one to three signature cotton-quilted prints, as well as other fabrications including Performance Twill, Re-Active, microfiber, and nylon some of which are also available in solid colors. These collections of prints and solids are incorporated into the designs of a wide range of products, including bags, accessories, and travel items. These collections typically include classic styles, updates to existing designs, and new product introductions.
To keep our assortment current and fresh, and to focus our inventory investments on our best performers, we discontinue prints and fabrications as necessary. We sell our remaining inventory of retired products primarily through our websites (including our online outlet site), factory outlet stores, typically our annual outlet sale, and third-party liquidators.
Pura Vida. We introduce new Pura Vida products seasonally, approximately three times a year (spring, summer, and fall). We release curated product assortments multiple times per season that each embody a trend that we believe resonates with our customer base. Each product launch collection typically consists of 20 to 30 customer choices. We offer a mix of seasonally inspired designs and next generation designs of core bestsellers.

Bags. Bags are a core part of our product offerings and are the primary component of every seasonal assortment. The category consists of classic and new styles developed by our product development team. Our bag product category includes items such as backpacks, totes, crossbodies, lunch bags, satchels, clutches, and baby bags. Bags play a prominent role in our visual merchandising, and we showcase the different fabrications, patterns, colors, and features of each bag.
Travel. Our travel product category includes rolling luggage, cosmetics, travel and packing accessories, and travel bags which include our iconic duffel and weekend bags. The first Vera Bradley product offering included duffel bags, which have consistently been strong performers. We believe their popularity, as well as the appeal of our other travel items, results from our vibrant designs, functional styles, and lightweight fabrications.
Accessories. Accessories include Vera Bradley-branded fashion accessories such as ID holders, lanyards, wallets, wristlets, eyewear, scarves, various technology accessories, hair accessories, as well as Pura Vida-branded accessories such as bracelets, rings, and necklaces. A majority of products are sold through the accessories category in the Pura Vida business. We believe our accessories are attractively priced and allow the consumer to include some color in her wardrobe. Our product development teams consistently update the accessories assortment based on consumer demand and fashion trends.
Home. Our home category includes textiles, including throw blankets, beach towels, and bedding, as well as items such as mugs and tumblers.
Apparel/Footwear. Our apparel and footwear category includes sleepwear, footwear, outerwear, cotton face masks, socks, Vera Bradley tops, and Pura Vida tees and hoodies. Cotton face mask sales began, and were most significant, during fiscal 2021 at both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida.
Product Development
Vera Bradley. We have implemented a fully integrated and cross-functional product development process that aligns design, trend and market research, merchandising, planning, sales, marketing, and sourcing. We believe product development is a core capability that makes our products unique and that our designs and aesthetics set our products apart and drive customer loyalty. Our design and product development teams combine an understanding of the desires of our target customers, with knowledge of upcoming color, material, consumer, and fashion trends to design new collections, as well as new product categories.
We typically begin the development stage of our products in the Vera Bradley portfolio twelve to eighteen months in advance of their release. The development of each new pattern includes the design of a primary print and sometimes a secondary coordinating print. All print development is managed by our internal print design team. Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate. We believe that great design is not only central to our products, but also is a fundamental part of our brand development and growth strategies.
Our design team works to ensure that new collections contain an assortment of products and styles that are in line with both trends and customer desires and regularly updates classic styles to enhance functionality. Our team monitors fashion trends and customer needs by typically attending trend and industry shows, subscribing to trend monitoring services, and engaging in comparison shopping.
Our product development team works closely with our marketing and merchandising teams to gather consumer insights through a variety of methodologies, including seasonal market research, in-store testing, scheduled interviews, and online and in-person surveys conducted by our internal team. Our work is also informed in part by market data analysis provided through our membership in industry services and organizations. The design and product development teams work to ensure that we offer products that are constructed to meet our design, function, construction, and quality standards in a cost-effective manner. We believe that, with our cross-functional, collaborative approach, we are able to introduce and market our products in a way that clearly communicates the Vera Bradley brand.
In addition to products developed in-house, we also pursue brand extensions through strategic partnerships, licensing agreements, and brand collaborations. We currently have licenses in place for eyewear; bedding; technology accessories; stationery/drinkware; sleepwear and loungewear; outdoor furniture, accessories, and décor; and wallpaper. We also have licensing agreements with Disney Consumer Products, Warner Brothers Consumer Products, Peanuts Worldwide, Crocs, Gillette, Totes, NCAA (collegiate), and certain U.S. Military forces. We will continue to look for the right strategic partners and licensees that can augment the brand and provide established distribution networks for certain categories of business. Additional arrangements will be launched in fiscal 2024.
Pura Vida. Pura Vida continues to develop new styles and re-invent existing styles. We have a cross-functional team that aligns product development with merchandising to strategically manage the design process. Our cross-functional team attends trade shows and performs market research to develop what we believe will be on-trend products that communicate and emulate the “pura vida” lifestyle. We also pursue brand extensions through licensing agreements and we have partnered with Discovery, Warner Brothers Consumer Products, Disney Consumer Products, Sanrio, and other companies that are consistent with our brand.
Marketing
We believe that the growth of our brands and our business is influenced by our ability to introduce and sell our merchandise in a way that clearly conveys the Vera Bradley and Pura Vida brand personalities. We use marketing as a critical tool in our efforts to promote our brands.
We are continually focused on looking for new ways to creatively engage and retain our customers, grow brand awareness, and introduce new customers to our brands in a cost-effective manner, but that is becoming more challenging and expensive for both of our brands due in part to rising digital media costs.
Vera Bradley’s marketing platform will continue to be a blend of digital and more traditional channels, such as direct mail, email, quality media placements, PR, and targeted TV ads. Our marketing efforts are increasingly reflective of our ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion. The goal of our 360 brand marketing program is to drive brand awareness and desirability, as well as connect with consumers where they are.
We will continue to drive social media engagement by employing more user-generated content, growing our influencer and ambassador programs, further enhancing social storytelling and social selling, expanding Facebook Live and Reels, and growing TikTok engagement.
Vera Bradley
Retention Advertising. We communicate with our established customers consistently throughout the year with regular e-mails, social media, and notifications, as well as seasonal direct mail related to the Vera Bradley brand. Our retention advertising is geared to keeping Vera Bradley top of mind with our customers, rewarding our customers, and providing them with news of our seasonal launches, new product introductions, and VB Cares initiatives. 
New Customer Acquisition Advertising. We primarily employ digital (i.e., display banner, mobile, geo-targeting, and pre-roll video) advertising to increase overall brand awareness and attract new customers.
Public Relations and Product Placement. Vera Bradley has received considerable editorial exposure in the press, with mentions in Oprah Daily, In Style, Good Morning America, Today, Cosmopolitan, WWD, Seventeen, Travel and Leisure, Real Simple, and Good Housekeeping. In addition, we have expanded our public relations efforts to reach popular online influencers and content creators.
Product placement of Vera Bradley products in feature-length films and on prime-time television shows remains strong with television placements in This is Us, All American, Call Me Kat, Grownish, How I Met Your Father, and The Neighborhood. Movie placements include: A Man Named Otto, Leave the World Behind, No Hard Feelings, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3, and Barbie.
Partnerships. During fiscal 2023, under the umbrella of VB Cares, we reinforced our position as a total stakeholder-focused and socially-conscious organization and continued to strengthen our community support and charitable initiatives that are meaningful to our customers and that make a significant impact on those in need, particularly women and children. Efforts included supporting the Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer, Blessings in a Backpack, New Hope Girls, Free Mom Hugs, One Atta Time, American Heart Association, Boys and Girls Club, Big Brothers Big Sisters, among others.
Social Media and Online Marketing. We use online marketing and social networking sites as tools to increase brand awareness and drive traffic to verabradley.com and to our Vera Bradley stores. Vera Bradley can be found on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube.
For Vera Bradley, we have captured approximately 7.5 million active customer e-mail addresses in our online customer file, with many of these customers providing age, occupation, and location data. This information provides us with deeper insight into the products and categories that are of the highest interest to our customers, and allows us to better target our customers with appropriate messages. As of January 28, 2023, we had approximately 2.0 million Facebook fans and approximately 72,000 Twitter followers. Our Instagram has grown to over 570,000 followers and is our most highly engaged social medium. In addition, we often partner with brand-right bloggers to promote our products.
Mall Advertising. We had representation in key markets with mall partner participation. Collaborations and holiday promotions were the primary focus for our retail store locations. The factory outlet channel participated in center marketing throughout the year highlighting key seasonal moments, such as: Spring Break, Back to School, Labor Day, and Holiday.
Direct Mail. Vera Bradley mailers are a vehicle for promoting the Vera Bradley brand and product portfolio. Each mailer is sent to a targeted customer mailing list. We believe our direct mail medium generates excitement and awareness about the Vera Bradley brand and allows us to reach both new and loyal customers in their homes. We use direct mail for prospecting, customer retention, and reactivation.
Pura Vida
Retention Advertising. We connect with our established customers with regular emails, affiliate marketing, SMS marketing, and social media marketing. Our retention advertising focuses on informing Pura Vida customers of new product launches, exclusive offers, inventory restocks of best sellers, upselling subscription products, promoting referral and loyalty rewards, and the latest Pura Vida news. 
New Customer Acquisition Advertising. Pura Vida focuses on digital advertising through Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Google, Snapchat, and Pinterest to acquire new customers. We are consistently testing new audiences, channels, creative ads, and promotions to maximize our return on paid media spend.
Ambassador Program. We have a grassroots program of brand ambassadors who drive customers to our website and generate buzz in local communities, digitally through their social media channels, in person through events, and through word of mouth. This program helps us reach our customers in a peer-to-peer fashion, similar to word of mouth marketing. We acquire these brand ambassadors through advertising on Instagram and Snapchat, as well as regular promotion through our organic and retention channels.
Influencer Marketing. We have tiers of small to large sized influencers across various key markets and demographic profiles. We work with macro influencers on product collaborations and campaigns, and foster organic relationships with them through photoshoots, trips, and events which we believe drives organic growth for the brand. We have also built a network of micro influencers through our gifted program who post for our brand in exchange for product and exposure on our social channels.
Charity Collaborations. We actively partner with charities to donate to causes that are important to our customers. To date, we have donated nearly $5.0 million to various charities around the world.
Events Marketing. To reach our existing customers in person, to acquire new customers, and to expose customers to the experiential aspect of our brand, we have hosted several successful events at our retail stores, including for store openings and seasonal-based events such as for Valentine's Day.
Seasonality
Because Vera Bradley and Pura Vida products are frequently given as gifts, we have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. In addition, our products are popular during back-to-school periods of August and September. Fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. 
Channels of Distribution
We distribute our Vera Bradley products through our VB Direct (including e-commerce and retail stores) and VB Indirect segments and Pura Vida products primarily through e-commerce, wholesale retailers, and retail stores. This multi-channel distribution model is designed to enable operational flexibility and maximizes the methods by which we can access potential customers.
Vera Bradley Direct Segment
Full-Line Stores. We have developed a retail presence through our full-line stores, all located in the United States, which provides us with a format to showcase our brand and the full array of Vera Bradley products. As of January 28, 2023, we operated 51 full-line stores averaging approximately 2,000 square feet per store. Our sales associates are passionate about our products and customer service, which we believe translates into a superior shopping experience.
Factory Outlet Stores. Our factory outlet stores are a vehicle for selling factory exclusive styles, as well as retired merchandise at discounted prices, while maintaining brand integrity. Typically, approximately 95% of the merchandise found in our factory outlet stores consists of factory exclusive styles. Factory outlet stores are an integral part of our distribution strategy, as this format provides an additional channel of distribution for our products and enables us to better target value-oriented customers. Our factory outlet stores average approximately 3,500 square feet per store and we expect to invest approximately $0.5 million per new store, consisting of inventory, pre-opening costs, and build-out costs, less tenant-improvement allowances. As of January 28, 2023, we operated 79 factory outlet stores, all located in the United States.
Store Location Selection Strategy. Our store location decisions for both full-line and factory outlet stores are made based upon our comprehensive retail strategy that includes actual and planned penetration in both Indirect and Direct segments, as well as existing e-commerce demand. While we have temporarily suspended full-line store growth and forecast that we will close additional full-line stores, we believe that long-term expansion of our store base is necessary to increase brand awareness and reinforce our brand image by contributing to our omni-channel retail strategy. In addition to analyzing store economics, we pay particular attention to the location within the shopping center, the size and shape of the space, and co-tenancies. Along with seeking co-tenants that we believe share our target customer, we seek a balanced mix of moderate and high-end retailers to encourage high levels of traffic.
Store Operations. The focus of our store operations is providing consumers with a comfortable and memorable shopping experience. We strive to make the experience interactive through special store events, such as showcasing newly launched products or celebrating our namesake’s birthday. Our customer service philosophy emphasizes friendly service, merchandise knowledge, and passion for the brand. Consequently, an essential requirement for the success of our stores is our ability to attract, train, and retain talented, highly motivated district managers, store managers, and sales associates. 
E-Commerce. We sell our products through the verabradley.com and verabradley.ca websites. The objective of these websites is to provide both a mechanism for marketing directly to consumers and a storefront where consumers can find the entire full-line Vera Bradley collection. During fiscal 2021, we re-platformed our websites to become more streamlined, nimble, and efficient in our technology platform and business processes. Since 2018, we have also operated an online outlet site to reduce clearance sales from verabradley.com. We had approximately 52 million visits to verabradley.com and our online outlet site during fiscal 2023.
Annual Outlet Sale. We have not held our annual outlet sale for the past three years as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic but plan to resume the sale in June 2023. Our annual outlet sale is typically held in the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum Exposition Center in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The annual outlet sale is an important tradition for Vera Bradley, has many loyal followers, and is an opportunity for us to sell our retired merchandise at discounted prices in a brand-right fashion.
Vera Bradley Indirect Segment
As of January 28, 2023, we sold our products in approximately 1,700 specialty retail locations, as well as department stores, national accounts, third-party e-commerce sites, and third-party inventory liquidators, as well as through licensing agreements. 
In fiscal 2012, we launched our products in the department store channel. We are currently in approximately 300 department store locations.
The top 25% of our specialty retailers account for approximately 80% of total specialty retailer revenue. No single Indirect retailer represented more than 10% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2023, with the top ten Indirect retailers, representing in the aggregate approximately 60% of total Indirect segment net revenues. The majority of our Indirect retailers have been customers for over five years.
Indirect Sales Force
We believe that having a combination of an in-house field sales force and a third-party agency, covering certain geographies, results in a more consistent brand presentation and messaging, enhanced support for our Indirect customers, and a more predictable, scalable, and cost-efficient business model. As of January 28, 2023, our in-house sales team consisted of approximately 25 full-time sales consultants.
In addition to acquiring new and growing existing accounts, our sales consultants serve as a support center for our Indirect customers by assisting and educating them in areas such as merchandising and visual presentation, marketing the brand, product selection, and inventory management. Our visual merchandising program provides our sales consultants with a framework to guide our Indirect customers regarding optimal product placement and display that is intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinctive.
Pura Vida Segment
E-Commerce. Pura Vida products are available on our websites, www.puravidabracelets.com, www.puravidabracelets.eu, and www.puravidabracelets.ca. Pura Vida’s website immerses visitors in the brand, its products, and its social mission. Pura Vida is a digitally native brand, and the e-commerce storefront continues to be the primary source of revenues for the Pura Vida business. The e-commerce site also includes a monthly bracelet and jewelry subscription club. The subscription club is a mechanism to continue to build brand loyalty and stimulate higher retention.
Wholesale. The Pura Vida wholesale channel is comprised primarily of specialty stores including Tilly’s, The Paper Store, Ron Jon Surf Shops, and Hallmark stores, among others. Pura Vida also has a presence on Amazon through a third-party wholesaler. We have a combination of in-house and external sales personnel who work with our wholesale retailers regarding order fulfillment and compilation.
Retail. Pura Vida has five retail store locations. Four of the locations opened in fiscal 2023 and one location opened in fiscal 2022. Our full-line locations are allowing us to showcase the Pura Vida lifestyle with a full array of existing products and new product innovations.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain Model
During fiscal 2023, we continued to be impacted by higher tariffs from previously duty-free countries, where we source products, as a result of the Generalized System of Preferences (“GSP”) duty-free status expiring at the end of calendar year 2020. We cannot guarantee if or when the GSP duty-free status will be reinstated and retro-actively applied by Congress. 
In addition, supply chain disruptions, including delivery delays and inbound and outbound freight cost increases began to stabilize toward the end of fiscal 2023. During the prior fiscal year, delivery delays oftentimes added several weeks of delays to our deliveries. 
Vera Bradley
Our multi-country manufacturing and supply chain model is designed to achieve efficient, timely, and accurate order fulfillment while maintaining appropriate levels of inventory.
Our manufacturing and sourcing strategy is part of the larger cross-functional product development process. The overall objective for our sourcing team is to build and sustain collaborative partnerships throughout our supply chain, with a focus on identifying appropriate countries and partners to manufacture our products while maintaining and focusing on flexibility. Our sourcing team leverages its expertise in negotiation, relationship management, flexibility, and change management to maintain a strong, diverse global supply chain. Our sourcing team also focuses on achieving the right balance of production sites and countries of origin to mitigate the risk of concentrated production, including potential incremental tariffs. To continue to assist in this risk mitigation, our sourcing team reduced our Vera Bradley production in China from over 50% in fiscal 2019 to approximately 15% in fiscal 2023.
We strive to maintain the appropriate balance of inventory to enable us to provide a high level of service to our customers, including prompt and accurate delivery of our products at a reasonable cost. We believe that we have an active and nimble sales and operations planning process that helps us balance the supply and demand issues that we encounter in our business, optimize our inventory levels, and anticipate inventory needs. We have also integrated our Vera Bradley planning, forecasting, and segmentation processes under one function called Merchandise Planning and Allocation. 
Approximately half of Vera Bradley product sales are cotton-based. Our other fabrics include primarily fleece, polyester, and microfiber. We source our raw materials from various suppliers in Asia, with the majority of non-cotton based products coming from China and South Korea. Our cotton-based products are sourced from areas outside of China. Our global sourcing team works with select suppliers enabling us to optimize the mix of cost, lead time, quality, and reliability within our global supply network. We actively mitigate raw materials price increases through purchasing at advantageous times and periods. All of our suppliers must comply with our quality standards, and we use only a limited number of pre-approved suppliers who have demonstrated a commitment to delivering the highest quality products. We are continually updating our factory audit process and building a better compliance program to ensure our vendor code of conduct is met. In fact, in fiscal 2022 we moved from internal factory audits to partnering with BetterWork to conduct the audits. BetterWork brings diverse groups together (governments, global brands, factory owners, unions, and workers) to improve working conditions in the garment industry and make the sector more competitive. These audits encompass both the Vera Bradley and Pura Vida brands. In April 2016, we opened an office in Hong Kong to lead the global supply chain in Asia, including the oversight of sourcing and procurement.
The majority of our Vera Bradley finished goods, not sourced through licenses or strategic partners, are manufactured by a variety of global manufacturers located primarily in Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, China, and the Philippines. We discontinued manufacturing in Myanmar in mid-2021. With the oversight of our office in Hong Kong and our independent contractors, we believe financial benefits have been realized without sacrificing the level of quality inherent in our products or service to our customers.
Pura Vida
Pura Vida products are sourced primarily from El Salvador, as well as China, India, Guatemala, Cambodia, and Indonesia. We have continued an active supply chain diversification process to ensure a focus on maintaining flexibility and to help mitigate the risk of concentrated production, similar to the Vera Bradley supply chain.
When determining the size of orders placed with our manufacturers, we take into account forward-looking demand, lead times for specific products, current inventory levels, and minimum order quantity requirements. Overseas production has resulted in substantial cost savings and a reduction of capital investment.
Distribution Centers
Vera Bradley owns a 428,500 square-foot distribution center in Roanoke, Indiana. This automated, computerized facility allows Vera Bradley employees to receive information directly from the order-collection center and quickly identify the products and quantities necessary to fulfill a particular order. The facility’s technology enables us to accurately process and pack orders, as well as track shipments and inventory. We believe that our systems for the processing and shipment of orders from our distribution center have enabled us to improve our overall customer service through enhanced order accuracy and reduced turnaround time; however, we continue to make technology and automation enhancements to our distribution center processes to promote optimal output.
Vera Bradley products are shipped primarily via third-party common carriers to our stores, our Indirect retailers, and directly to our customers who purchase through our website. We believe we are positioned well to support the order fulfillment requirements of our business, including business generated through our website.
Pura Vida products for the U.S. e-commerce site and wholesale accounts are distributed primarily through a third-party provider in Tijuana, Mexico. Pura Vida also distributes product through a third-party provider in the Netherlands and Canada, which supports European e-commerce and Canadian wholesale operations, respectively.
Management Information Systems
We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position. We maintain computer hardware, applications, and networks to enhance and accelerate the design process, to support the sale and distribution of our products to our customers, and to improve the integration and efficiency of our operations. Our information systems are designed to provide, among other things, enterprise class business management, comprehensive order processing for all commerce channels, production, accounting, and management information and analytics for the product development, retail, sales, marketing, distribution, finance, and human resources functions of our business. In fiscal 2021 at Vera Bradley, we 
migrated our ERP, POS, Business Intelligence, and Order Management systems to cloud-based platforms streamlining and simplifying our work and providing for additional capabilities such as mobile POS and multi-company operations on the same platform. We completed our ERP migration during fiscal 2022 for Pura Vida, so that our entire enterprise is on a unified technology platform. We continue to assess our on-premise and cloud-based technology solutions in an effort to ensure we have the optimal solutions for our business. We are continuing to implement a new suite of inventory planning tools to optimize full line assortments, localized assortments, pricing and promotion planning, and inventory positions. Part of these tools were implemented in fiscal 2023 and the remainder is planned for implementation in fiscal 2024.
Competition
For both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida, we face strong competition in each of the product lines and markets in which we compete. We believe that all of our products are in similar competitive positions with respect to the number of competitors they face and the level of competition within each product line. Due to the number of different products we offer, it is not practicable for us to quantify the number of competitors we face. Our products compete with other branded products within their product categories and with private label products sold by retailers. Moreover, the general availability of contract manufacturing allows new entrants to relatively easily access the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. We compete against other independent retailers, department stores, catalog retailers, gift retailers, and Internet businesses that engage in the retail sale of similar products. 
The market for handbags and accessories, in particular, is highly competitive. Our competitors include not only established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of handbags and accessories, but also frequent new entrants to the market. We directly compete with wholesalers and direct sellers of branded handbags and accessories.
In varying degrees, depending on the product category involved, we compete on the basis of design (aesthetic appeal), quality (construction), function, price point, distribution, and brand positioning. We believe that our primary competitive advantages are consumer recognition of our brands, customer loyalty and engagement, product development expertise, and our widespread presence through our multi-channel distribution model. Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, distribution, marketing, and other resources than we do. Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets.
Copyrights and Trademarks
For Vera Bradley, the development of new patterns includes the design of primary and secondary prints. Once developed, we generally copyright our patterns as appropriate. We currently have over 1,200 copyrights related to the Vera Bradley business.
We also own the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, and distribution of all of our products, both in the United States and in the other countries in which our products are principally sold. Our trademarks include “Vera Bradley” and “Pura Vida.” We aggressively police our trademarks and copyrights and pursue infringers and counterfeiters both domestically and internationally. Our trademarks will remain in existence for as long as we continue to use and renew them in advance of their expiration dates. We have no material patents.

Equal employment opportunities are available to all persons at Vera Bradley, Inc. without regard to race, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, age, color, religion, creed, national origin, ancestry, mental or physical disability, medical condition, genetic information, military or veteran status or any other category protected under applicable federal, state, or local law. We put this standard into practice through our hiring, training, and an annual affirmative action program. 
As of January 28, 2023, we had approximately 2,180 employees. Of the total, approximately 1,475 were engaged in Vera Bradley retail selling positions; approximately 315 were engaged in Vera Bradley distribution, sourcing and quality functions; approximately 50 were engaged in Vera Bradley product design; approximately 90 were involved in the Pura Vida business, including the Pura Vida retail stores; and approximately 250 were engaged in corporate support and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good, and we have never encountered a significant work stoppage other than as related to temporary stoppages necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Project Quilt. In fiscal 2021, we launched our Company-wide diversity and inclusion initiative, Project Quilt, to continue to enhance diversity, equality, and inclusion, focusing on three key areas – the Associate Experience, the Customer Experience, and the Community Experience.
Engagement. Vera Bradley believes it is critical to engage its different stakeholders in order to understand their views, values, and ideas and to design a more responsible environment for all involved. This stakeholder group includes associates. The Company engages its associates through surveys, town halls, and focus groups. Collectively, the Company's success is based upon the unique value of each person's contributions. Our long-term success depends on talented and engaged associates. 
Every year, we conduct an associate engagement survey in order to better understand our associates’ insights into our Company’s strengths and opportunities. In calendar year 2022, we once again had outstanding participation, with over 80% of our associates sharing their candid feedback. Our calendar year 2022 overall engagement score was once again above average in all categories compared to peer companies with some categories in the upper quartile compared to peer companies. The feedback gave us insight into improvement opportunities and was instrumental in decisions we made to shape, strengthen, and improve our Company. As a result of the survey feedback, over the last several years we have made meaningful improvements to benefits, career development, compensation, mental health and wellness programs, and our facilities. We believe listening to our associates’ feedback provided through the annual engagement surveys continually strengthens our corporate culture.
Additionally, on February 9, 2022, Vera Bradley was awarded the #1 ranking on the Forbes list of America’s Best Midsize Employers 2022. This prestigious award is presented by Forbes and Statista Inc., the world-leading statistics portal and industry ranking provider. 
Pay and Benefits. The Company offers competitive pay packages that include market-competitive base and hourly compensation, healthcare, a 401(k) savings plan that typically includes a Company contribution match, paid time off (including for volunteer work), paid family leave, matching gifts program, and an Employee Assistance Program.
Leadership Programs. Our associates are our biggest asset and when they win, we all win. We recognize everyone in the Company has the ability to lead by example and influence others in a positive way that ultimately provides meaningful value and will make us stronger. Our long-term initiative, Leaders by Design, encourages our associates to grow as leaders through
new associate orientation and onboarding, formal training programs, mentorship programs, job shadowing and career-pathing programs and development, including THE LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE®, a globally recognized, research-based leadership development program designed to enhance leadership effectiveness.
Associate Safety. Associate safety and well-being is of paramount importance to our Company. We have a comprehensive employee safety program, WorkWise Wellness, that focuses on overall employee health and safety. The WorkWise Wellness program emphasizes our high standard of safety throughout all operations of the organization. The program and its materials, including a comprehensive Safety Manual, addresses a variety of topics including reporting injuries, OSHA compliance, and emergency procedures (related to workplace violence, active shooters, severe weather and blood-borne pathogens, among others). Policies are routinely communicated and training is provided to associates as appropriate.
Government Regulation
Many of our imported products are subject to existing or potential duties or tariffs that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the United States and other countries or impact the cost of such products. Customs duties have not comprised a material portion of the total cost of a majority of our products. In addition, we are subject to foreign governmental regulation and trade restrictions, including U.S. retaliation against prohibited foreign practices, with respect to our product sourcing and international sales operations.
We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental matters, including the handling, transportation, and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, and groundwater. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties, or the imposition of other liabilities. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. If we violate any laws or regulations, however, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
