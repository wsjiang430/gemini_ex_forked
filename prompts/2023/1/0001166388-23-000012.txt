Item 1. Business
Our Company 
Verint® Systems Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “Verint”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”, unless the context indicates otherwise) helps brands provide Boundless Customer Engagement™. For more than two decades, the world’s most iconic brands – including more than 85 of the Fortune 100 companies – have trusted Verint to provide the technology and domain expertise they require to effectively build enduring customer relationships.
Verint is uniquely positioned to help organizations close the Engagement Capacity Gap™ with our differentiated Verint Customer Engagement Cloud Platform. Brands today are challenged by new workforce dynamics, ever-expanding customer engagement channels and exponentially more consumer interactions – often while facing limited budgets and resources. As a result, brands are finding it more challenging to deliver the desired customer experience. This creates a capacity gap, which is widening as the digital transformation continues. Organizations are increasingly seeking technology to close this gap with solutions that are based on artificial intelligence (“AI”) and are developed specifically for customer engagement. These solutions automate workflows across enterprise silos to optimize the workforce expense and at the same time drive an elevated consumer experience. 
Verint is headquartered in Melville, New York, and has approximately 30 offices worldwide. We have approximately 4,300 passionate employees plus a few hundred contractors around the globe exclusively focused on helping brands provide Boundless Customer Engagement.
Background
We were incorporated in Delaware in February 1994 and completed our initial public offering in May 2002. 
On February 1, 2021, we completed the spin-off (the “Spin-Off”) of Cognyte Software Ltd. (“Cognyte”), whose business and operations consisted of our former Cyber Intelligence Solutions business (the “Cognyte Business”), into an independent public company. For further information on discontinued operations, see Note 2, “Discontinued Operations” in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Through our website at www.verint.com, we make available our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, filed or furnished by us pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such materials with, or furnish such materials to, the SEC. Our website address set forth above is not intended to be an active link, and information on our website is not incorporated in, and should not be construed to be a part of, this report.
Market Opportunity
The customer engagement market is increasingly embracing digital transformation across the enterprise while also transitioning to the cloud. With the shift to digital, brands are experiencing an increasing number of customer interactions as well as elevated customer expectations for faster and more consistent and contextual responses across any engagement channel. With the constraints of limited budget and resources, brands realize that hiring more workers and increasing workforce expense is not a sustainable solution. This creates an Engagement Capacity Gap, and as consumer adoption of digital accelerates, the gap is widening. Many brands are already experiencing the consequences of the widening gap and face the risk of declining brand reputation and customer attrition. The market is seeking new customer engagement technology and the opportunity is to use innovative AI, specifically designed for customer engagement automation, that can help brands close this gap.
The Opportunity: Close the Engagement Capacity Gap
Market Trends
We believe there are three market trends that are benefiting Verint today: the acceleration of digital transformation, a changing workforce, and elevated customer expectations.
•Acceleration of Digital Transformation: Digital transformation is accelerating, and it is driving significant change in customer engagement for contact centers and across the enterprise. Long gone are the days when customer journeys were limited to phone calls into a contact center. Today, customer journeys take place across many touchpoints in the enterprise and across many communication and collaboration platforms, with digital leading the way. Many brands understand that as digital rises in importance and telephony becomes more commoditized, organizations need to change business processes and focus on application capabilities when making customer engagement technology decisions. Customer touchpoints take place in contact centers, in back-office and branch operations, in ecommerce, in digital marketing, in self-service, and in customer experience departments. We believe that the breadth of customer touchpoints across the enterprise and the rapid growth in digital interactions benefit Verint as these trends create demand for new solutions that increase automation and connect organizational silos to increase efficiency and elevate the customer experience.
•A Changing Workforce: Brands are facing unprecedented challenges when it comes to how they manage their changing workforce. Increasingly, brands are managing employees that may work from anywhere. Providing flexibility for where employees work creates challenges in managing and coaching employee teams. And because of the limited resources that are available, brands must drive greater workforce efficiency. They need to find ways to use technology like AI-powered bots to augment their workforce. Brands recognize the need to leverage data and automation to achieve greater efficiency. In addition, the importance of the employee experience continues to grow, and brands must quickly evolve how they recruit, onboard, and retain employees. We believe that these trends benefit Verint as they create demand for new solutions that can shape the future of work, with a workforce of people and bots working together, increased automation, greater employee flexibility, and a greater focus on the voice of the employees.
•Elevated Customer Expectations: Customer expectations for faster, more consistent, and contextual responses continue to rise, and meeting those expectations is becoming more difficult with legacy technology. The increase in the number of channels and the desire of customers to seamlessly shift between channels creates a more complex customer journey for brands to support and manage. Customers also expect that each brand will have a deep understanding of the customer’s relationship with that brand — an understanding that is unified across the enterprise regardless of whether the customer touchpoint is in the contact center, on a website, through a mobile app, in the back office or in a branch. To develop that deep understanding, brands recognize the need to pull together the data that has traditionally 
existed in silos across the business and use that data to inform and automate the customer experience. We believe that this trend benefits Verint as it creates demand for new solutions that help brands support complex customer journeys and increase automation to meet elevated customer expectations.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to help brands close the Engagement Capacity Gap with our innovative, AI-powered, platform that enables customer experience (CX) automation. Our platform helps brands create significant business value throughout the organization by introducing automation and workflows to reduce operating costs while at the same time increasing customer satisfaction and revenue opportunities.
Below are the key elements of our platform, including our open approach to the ecosystem which has made us easy to work with, our market leading Verint Da Vinci™ AI and Analytics, our robust Engagement Data Hub, best-of-breed applications, and enterprise-wide capabilities: 
•Open Approach to the Ecosystem: Because it is designed to be open, the Verint Platform can seamlessly fit into a brand’s enterprise ecosystem. The open and extensible architecture enables the platform to easily integrate and augment the brand’s existing systems of record such as customer relationship management (CRM). The platform is designed to manage a large volume of engagement data and seamlessly integrate with the brand’s enterprise data strategy. The platform is agnostic to communication infrastructure choices and seamlessly integrates with a brand’s existing CCaaS (contact center as-a-service), UCaaS (unified communications as-a-service), and CPaaS (communications platform as-a-service) solutions. Verint’s open cloud platform is more than the technology alone – it provides an opportunity for our customers and partners to build a community through our Verint Connect web portal. Verint Connect can be accessed directly from our cloud platform and provides the tools and resources to foster a rich partner and customer ecosystem around our applications. These tools include a marketplace where Verint and partner components are made available to accelerate time to value with downloadable extensions, and a developer portal where customers can engage directly with the Verint technical community. Our APIs are available to test, with code samples, developer sandboxes, downloadable test clients, education, and discussion forums. Verint Connect also provides access to educational courses, our support teams, a knowledgebase and a community for customers and partners to interact with each other.
•Engagement Data Hub: The Verint Platform includes an Engagement Data Hub. Interaction data captured from multiple voice, video, digital, and social communication systems, experience data captured from multiple survey systems, and enrichment data from systems of record, are unified and managed in a single data hub at the core of the platform. Engagement data in the hub is made available for Verint Da Vinci algorithms for any Verint application 
which requires access to it, as well as for the brand’s data lake strategy to its business intelligence tools, and to its partners who need data to develop their own applications. Verint applications use the engagement data in the hub to address several areas including contact center analytics, enterprise analytics, customer journey analytics, workforce compliance with policies and regulations, and fraud mitigation.
•Verint Da Vinci™ AI and Analytics: We believe Verint is a market leader in AI solutions specifically designed for customer engagement. Verint’s AI capabilities, named Verint Da Vinci™ AI and Analytics, are embedded natively in the core of the Verint Platform. Verint Da Vinci is used by the business applications running in the platform to infuse AI across the platform. Verint Da Vinci capabilities are the result of over two decades of research into optimizing customer engagement and use state-of-the-art machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning algorithms. Honed on our unique data set, Verint Da Vinci is supported by a large and growing team of data and AI scientists, working on pure and applied research to advance Verint Da Vinci and solve global customer engagement challenges.
•Best-of-Breed Business Applications: The breadth of the Verint Platform includes applications that are rich in capability and enable a brand to apply best-of-breed processes to close the engagement capacity gap. For a contact center, that includes capabilities for forecasting, quality, knowledge, analytics, channel automation, and more. For other areas of the organization with customer touchpoints, the Verint Platform also includes deep capabilities such as web self-service, enterprise experience management and branch location workforce management.
•Enterprise-wide Capabilities: The Verint Platform enables customer engagement initiatives across all areas of a business – from the contact center and back office to retail locations as well as through their websites and mobile applications. The engagement data hub at the core of the platform manages data captured across the enterprise and Verint DaVinci AI and Analytics powers the platform applications with enterprise-wide CX automation.
Our Customer Engagement Solutions
The Verint Platform offers a broad set of solutions to help brands close the Engagement Capacity Gap. The platform is open and modular to offer maximum flexibility. Brands can choose to deploy solutions by starting anywhere based on their business priorities, and then expand with other solutions over time to maximize their return on investment.
In addition to the platform’s core components described above, brands can deploy a variety of best-of-breed business applications across three solution areas: Digital-First Engagement, Workforce Engagement, and Experience Management. 
Digital-First Engagement
Our Digital-First Engagement applications help brands accelerate their digital strategy, including through: 
•Channel Automation: Enable conversational automation over digital channels, as well as workforce orchestration across all channels, to help businesses scale customer engagement, reduce cost-per-contact, and power seamless self-service.
•Engagement Channels: Brands can digitally transform the customer experience across a wide number of channels, including messaging, social, chat, email, interactive voice response (IVR), and communities.
•Conversational AI: With our intelligent virtual assistant (IVA), enable human-like conversations across every channel delivering productive and personalized experiences.
•Knowledge Management: Enable humans and bots with knowledge to deliver outstanding service with tools for accessing content across the organization, delivering consistent and compliant answers, and achieving compliance with regulations and processes. 
Workforce Engagement
Our Workforce Engagement applications help brands manage their customer engagement work and their workforce across the enterprise. From the contact center to the back office and branch, these applications enable brands to empower a workforce of humans and bots, enable connected work across all silos, and drive real-time work actions. We offer applications for the following:
•Forecasting & Scheduling: Enable brands to understand the work needed to meet and exceed customer expectations, determine the optimal resourcing strategy to address customer expectations with a combination of employee input and automation, and provide staff across all customer touchpoints and across the enterprise with flexible scheduling options for balancing work and personal needs.
•Quality & Compliance: Enable the use of automation and workflows to make customer interactions across both attended and self-service voice and digital channels more pleasant, productive, and secure, while empowering employees with the skills they need to deliver outstanding performance.
•Interaction Insights: Extract insights from structured and unstructured customer interactions and activities across the enterprise to drive strategy, productivity, customer loyalty, and revenue.
•Real-Time Work: Support in-the-moment workforce activities with workflows, guidance, assistance, and automation to enhance customer experiences, workforce engagement, and compliance, while reducing operating costs.
Experience Management
Our Experience Management applications help brands collect and analyze customer experience data across all customer journeys - including direct, indirect, and inferred experiences - across digital, contact center, and location touchpoints. With a complete and unified view of the customer experience, brands are empowered with insights and actions to improve engagement from every level of the organization. Within this solution area, we offer applications for the following:
•Enterprise-wide: Enable brands to understand CX metrics across their organization so that they can identify and prioritize CX initiatives.
•Web and Mobile: Help brands to understand voice of the customer data across web, mobile, social, and survey feedback.
•Location: Help brands to understand complex customer journeys at store or retail banking locations by measuring multiple touchpoints, and driving improvements in real-time.
Our Experience Management applications can be combined to provide solutions that solve experience management challenges throughout the enterprise, in the contact center, for digital teams, retail locations, marketing organizations and employee experience for human resources departments.
In addition to the Verint Platform, Verint continues to develop and enhance its Workforce Engagement (WFE) On-Premises Platform. Customers running the On-Premises Platform may also choose to keep their applications on-premises, while adding applications from the Verint Platform. They can also choose to convert to the Verint Platform when they are ready to move their applications to the cloud. We are committed to providing our customers with choice and flexibility when it comes to 
deploying solutions on-premises or in the cloud. We can help our customers evolve customer engagement at their own pace, while protecting their existing investments with minimal disruption to their operations.
Our Customers 
Our customer engagement solutions are used by approximately 10,000 organizations in over 175 countries across a diverse set of verticals, including financial services, healthcare, utilities, technology, and government. Our customers include large enterprises with thousands of employees, as well as SMB organizations. In the year ended January 31, 2023, we derived approximately 70%, 20%, and 10% of our revenue from sales to customers in the Americas, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and in the Asia-Pacific (“APAC”) regions, respectively. In the year ended January 31, 2023, no customer or partner represented more than 10% of our total revenue.
Seasonality and Cyclicality 
As is typical for many software and technology companies, our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical factors. In most years, our revenue and operating income are typically highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter (prior to the impact of unusual or nonrecurring items). Moreover, revenue and operating income in the first quarter of a new year may be lower than in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, in some years, potentially by a significant margin. In addition, we generally receive a higher volume of orders in the last month of a quarter, with orders concentrated in the latter part of that month. We believe that these seasonal and cyclical factors primarily reflect customer spending patterns and budget cycles, as well as the impact of incentive compensation plans for our sales personnel. While seasonal and cyclical factors such as these are common in the software and technology industry, this pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future revenue or financial performance. Many other factors, including general economic conditions, may also have an impact on our business and financial results. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of factors which may affect our business and financial results.
Direct and Indirect Sales
We sell our solutions through our direct sales teams and indirect channels. Our direct sales teams are focused on large and mid-sized customers and, in many cases, co-sell with our indirect channels. Our indirect channels also address large and midsize customers, as well as smaller customers. Our direct sales teams and indirect channels are supported by business consultants, solutions specialists, and presales engineers who, during the sales process, help determine customer requirements and develop technical responses to those requirements.
Customer Success
We offer a range of services to help our customers achieve their business objectives and maximize their return on investment. Additionally, we provide our customers and partners with metrics to measure our solutions’ adoption, performance, and effectiveness to deliver the desired business outcomes. The services we provide include the following:
Cloud Operations. We deploy our cloud applications in multiple cloud environments, including the leading cloud infrastructure environments. We provide our customers with service-level commitments with respect to uptime and support.
Managed Services. We offer a range of managed services that are recurring in nature and can be delivered in conjunction with our technology or on a standalone basis, which help build strong relationships with our customers.
Implementation. Configurations, commissioning, integrations, and other implementation work can be performed by us, our authorized partners, or by end customers themselves. 
Education and Training. Education and training programs are designed for customers and to certify our partners. Customer and partner training is provided at the customer site, at our training centers around the world, and/or remotely through Verint Academy, our learning management system.
Consulting and Value Services. We and our partners offer customers help in maximizing the value of our solutions, including consulting on business strategy, process excellence, performance management, and project and program management.
Support. We offer a range of support plans to our customers and partners, designed to help ensure long-term successful use of our solutions. 
Research and Development 
We continue to enhance the features and performance of our existing solutions and introduce new solutions through extensive research and development (“R&D”) activities. Our R&D team, which is comprised of engineers, data scientists, PhDs and other technical experts, have deep software expertise, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence, data aggregation and curation, machine learning, specialized language and vocabulary processing, and other key areas that support our strategic initiatives. In addition to the development of new solutions and the addition of capabilities to existing solutions, our R&D activities include cloud platform and shared service investment, quality assurance, and advanced technical support for our customer services organization. R&D is performed primarily in the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Hungary, India, and Indonesia.
To support our research and development efforts, we make significant investments in R&D every year. We have a well-defined roadmap to introduce new features and functionality that we believe will further enhance the value of our solutions to our customers. We allocate our R&D resources in response to market research and customer demand for additional features and solutions. Our development strategy involves rolling out initial releases of our products and cloud services and adding features over time. We consider feedback received from our customers as part of our product development process. While the majority of our products are developed internally, in some cases, we also acquire or license technologies, products, and applications from third parties based on timing and cost considerations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us” in Item 1A of this report.
Third-Party Suppliers 
For certain services, products, or components, including our cloud hosting operations, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Regulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality—We rely on third parties for our cloud hosting operations, which could expose us to liability and harm our business and reputation” in Item 1A of this report for a discussion of risks associated with our suppliers and our cloud partners.
Human Capital
We are committed to conducting business in an ethical manner and to working towards a sustainable future. We believe that doing so contributes to our objectives of creating value for our stakeholders, including customers and partners, employees and stockholders, the communities in which we work and the global community at large, and helping make the world a better place.
As of January 31, 2023, we employed approximately 4,300 employees plus a few hundred contractors, with approximately 43%, 34%, and 23% of our employees and contractors located in the Americas, EMEA (including Israel), and APAC, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and a critical factor in our success. The market for talent in our industry is highly competitive. See Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the human capital risks we face.
Our employees in the United States are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. In some cases, our employees outside the United States are automatically subject to certain protections negotiated by organized labor in those countries directly with the government or trade unions, or are automatically entitled to severance or other benefits mandated under local laws.
We maintain policies and procedures to comply with the UK Modern Slavery Act, in an effort to ensure that our practices are in line with relevant human rights and labor standards. We are committed to ensuring that neither our own business practices nor those of our suppliers involve any form of slavery, forced labor, or human trafficking, or child labor.
Culture and Values
We have five core values that inform how we operate and the way we conduct our business:
•The integrity to do what’s right
•The innovation to create leading solutions for real-world challenges
•The transparency that fuels mutual trust and productive, collaborative working relationships
•The humility to view our successes as milestones in our journey, and our mistakes as opportunities for improvement
•A passion for making our customers and partners successful
These values are at the heart of our business activities, engagements, and relationships with stakeholders.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Our mission is to have our company reflect the global communities in which we work and the customers we serve. We are dedicated to fostering an inclusive and diverse global workforce and believe that our business is further strengthened by that diversity.
For the year ended January 31, 2023, on a global basis, women represented 33% of our employees and 29% of our leadership roles.
For the year ended January 31, 2023, approximately 35% of our U.S. workforce was comprised of minorities.
Our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce continues to be a priority, with a focus both on gender and on those groups historically underrepresented in the technology field.
•We are currently building relationships in the U.S. with historically black and women colleges, including establishing connections with career centers, attending career fairs they organize, and establishing recruiting programs for interns and new graduates from such schools.
•Our U.S. talent recruitment efforts focus on strategic outreach to build diverse pools of qualified candidates that include posting open jobs with over 70+ minority-based organizations and job alliances, including those focused on opportunities for veterans, disabled persons, and promoting ethnic and gender diversity.
Our Diversity & Inclusion Council focuses on promoting an environment that attracts and retains the best talent, values diversity, educates our employees, and encourages innovation. The council has two main objectives:
1.Continue to increase diversity across the organization when recruiting new talent; and
2.Increase cultural and diversity awareness within the organization through training, education, community partnership, and employee events. 
The council currently has several initiatives underway and is actively promoting gender inclusion, through our “Women In Tech” employee resource group.
Our board of directors is currently comprised of 10 directors, 2 of whom are female, and we are continuing our efforts to enhance the diversity of our board.
The board has adopted a policy (reflected in the Corporate Governance Guidelines contained in the charter of the Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee) that the initial list of candidates from which new director nominees are selected as part of any independent search process initiated by the board include candidates with a diversity of gender, race, or ethnicity. The composition of the current board reflects diversity in business and professional experience, skills, gender, and age among our directors.
Employee Wellness, Development & Engagement
We have adopted a hybrid work model, offering our employees flexibility on where they work. We provide each employee with a full technology stack comprised of a laptop, monitors, and other accessories to support a remote work setup.
Our company-paid or subsidized benefits, competitive paid time off programs, flexible work schedules, and family-friendly environment are key in recruiting and retaining high-caliber talent globally. 
We are focused on employee wellness, including by providing programs that focus on mental health, financial and physical wellness, and advice to improve work life balance. We also provide a company-paid employee assistance program that provides for over 200 learning opportunities for our employees’ personal and professional growth and other initiatives focused on providing employees with a toolkit of professional development options.
We recognize differences in family composition and our U.S. benefit plans provide options for employees in diverse family circumstances, including domestic partner benefits, adoption assistance, and fertility assistance.
Our fast-paced, challenging, and collaborative work environment nurtures professional growth and offers a wide array of career advancement opportunities. Our workforce planning tools provide managers with a framework for thinking strategically about the talent needed to achieve our business goals. Continuous learning and the professional development of our employees are key factors in our success. All our employees are afforded the opportunity to take part in our training programs, with the ability to focus their learning on the skills and knowledge that are most relevant for their professional development. We offer thousands of training courses in our online Learning Center in addition to classroom training. We conduct annual performance reviews for all of our employees, which include an opportunity for employees to discuss career development with their managers.
Community Involvement and Giving
We are committed to giving back to the communities in which we live and work. In 2005, we launched the Verint Next-Generation Program, which engages our employees around the globe in projects that benefit children in need. 
As part of the program, our employees have engaged in various community activities, including supplying food pantries, participating in blood drives, collecting clothing and school supplies, building playgrounds, cleaning parks and planting gardens. We are also proud to support our employees’ community service activities with programs for donating employee time to qualified children’s organizations and matching grants. For the year ended January 31, 2023, Verint and our employees donated over $450,000 to children’s charities through the program, with nearly 500 of our employees supporting approximately 40 local non-profit organizations in our local communities. For the year ended January 31, 2023, we also focused on supporting vulnerable children in Ukraine given the essential humanitarian aid required for children and their families.
Please see the Diversity and Inclusion section of our website and our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report in the Corporate Responsibility section of our website for further information on our ESG initiatives, including with respect to human capital. These resources and the information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report filed with the SEC.
Competition 
We face strong competition from many vendors, some of whom focus on customer engagement and some of whom offer customer engagement-related capabilities. Key competitors include Alvaria, Inc., Calabrio, Inc., Genesys, Medallia, NICE Ltd., Pegasystems Inc., Qualtrics International Inc., divisions of larger companies, including Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, and Salesforce, Inc., as well as many smaller companies, which vary from region to region globally.
We believe that we compete principally on the basis of:
•Product performance and functionality;
•Product quality and reliability;
•Breadth of product portfolio, ease of infrastructure integration, and pre-defined application integrations;
•Global presence, reputation, and high-quality customer service and support;
•Specific domain expertise, industry knowledge, vision, and experience; and 
•Price.
We believe that our competitive success depends primarily on our ability to provide technologically advanced and cost-effective solutions and services, including achieving and maintaining the competitive differentiation of our solution platform. Some of our competitors have, among other things, superior brand recognition and significantly greater financial or other resources than we do. We expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter our markets or we enter theirs, and as new products, services, and technologies are introduced. In addition, consolidation is common in our markets and has in the past and may in the future improve the position of our competitors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—Intense competition in our markets and competitors with greater resources or the ability to move faster than us may limit our market share, profitability, and growth” in Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the competitive risks we face.
Intellectual Property Rights 
General
Our success depends to a significant degree on the legal protection of our software and other proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees and third parties to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Patents
As of January 31, 2023, we had more than 700 patents and patent applications worldwide across areas including data capture, artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, and automation. We regularly review new areas of technology related to our businesses to determine whether they can and should be patented.
Licenses
Our customer and partner license agreements prohibit the unauthorized use, copying, and disclosure of our software technology and contain customer restrictions and confidentiality terms. These agreements generally warrant that the software and proprietary hardware will materially comply with written documentation and assert that we own or have sufficient rights in the software we distribute and have not violated the intellectual property rights of others. We generally make our solutions available through our cloud platform or license them in a format that does not permit users to change the software code.
While we employ many of our innovations exclusively in our own products and services, we also engage in outbound and inbound licensing of specific patented technologies. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based on industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Markets, Competition, and Operations—For certain services, products, or components, we rely on third-party providers, which may create significant exposure for us” in Item 1A of this report.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We use various trademarks and service marks to protect the marks used in our business. We also claim common law protections for other marks we use in our business. 
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Intellectual Property—Our intellectual property may not be adequately protected” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Intellectual Property—Our products or other IP may infringe or may be alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, which could lead to costly disputes or disruptions for us and may require us to indemnify our customers and resellers for any damages they suffer” in Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion regarding the risks associated with the protection of our intellectual property.
Regulatory Matters
Our business and operations are subject to a variety of evolving regulatory requirements in the countries in which we operate or in which we offer our solutions, including, among other things, with respect to data privacy, artificial intelligence, information security, government contracts, anti-corruption, trade compliance, tax, and labor matters. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Regulatory Matters, Data Privacy, Information Security, and Product Functionality—We are subject to complex, evolving regulatory requirements that may be difficult and expensive to comply with and that could negatively impact us or our business”, and “—Increasing regulatory focus on data privacy issues and expanding laws in these areas may result in increased compliance costs, impact our business models, and expose us to increased liability” in Item 1A of this report for a more detailed discussion of the regulatory risks we face.
