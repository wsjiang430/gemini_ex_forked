ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
MediaCo Holding Inc. (“MediaCo” or the “Company”) is an owned and operated multi-media company formed in Indiana in 2019, focused on radio and digital advertising, premium programming and events.
Our assets consist of two radio stations, WQHT(FM) and WBLS(FM), which serve the New York City demographic market area that primarily targets Black, Hispanic, and multi-cultural consumers. We derive our revenues primarily from radio and digital advertising sales, but we also generate revenues from events, including sponsorships and ticket sales, licensing, and syndication.
On December 9, 2022, Fairway Outdoor LLC, FMG Kentucky, LLC and FMG Valdosta, LLC (collectively, “Fairway”), all of which are wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries of MediaCo, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), with The Lamar Company, L.L.C., a Louisiana limited liability company (the “Purchaser”). The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement closed as of the date of the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price was $78.6 million, subject to certain customary adjustments, paid at closing in cash. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $46.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2022.
We have classified the related assets and liabilities associated with our Fairway business as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets and the results of our Fairway business have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented through December 9, 2022 as the sale represented a strategic shift in our business that had a major effect on our operations and financial results. Unless otherwise noted, discussion refers to the Company's continuing operations. See Note 2 — Discontinued Operations in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.
Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we”, “us” and “our” refer to MediaCo and its subsidiaries.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
We are committed to improving the operating results of our core assets while simultaneously seeking future growth opportunities in new radio businesses that focus predominately on multi-cultural audiences in the national and digital advertising spaces. Our strategy is focused on the following operating principles:
Develop unique and compelling content and strong brands
Our established nationally recognized media brands have achieved and sustained a leading position in their respective local market segments over many years, with each having a strong brand identity that reaches beyond its local footprint. The knowledge of the New York market and consistently producing unique and compelling content that meets the needs of our target audiences are critical to our success. As such, we make substantial investments in areas such as market research, data analysis and creative talent to ensure that our content remains relevant and fresh, has a meaningful impact on the communities we serve and reinforces the core brand image of each respective property.
Extend the reach and relevance of our local brands through digital platforms
In recent years, we have placed substantial emphasis on enhancing the distribution of our radio content through digital and mobile platforms. We believe these digital platforms offer excellent opportunities to further enhance the relationships we have with our audiences by allowing them to consume and share our content in new ways and providing us with new distribution channels for one-to-one communication with our end user.
Deliver results to advertisers
Competition for advertising revenue is highly competitive and becoming more so as the overall market has declined due to shifts in the way advertising dollars are directed. To remain competitive, we focus on sustaining and growing our radio audiences, optimizing our pricing strategy and developing innovative marketing programs for our clients that allow them to interact with our audiences in more direct and measurable ways. These programs often include elements such as on-air endorsements, events, contests, special promotions, Internet advertising, email marketing, interactive mobile advertising and online video. Our ability to deploy multi-touchpoint marketing programs allows us to deliver a stronger return-on-investment for our clients while simultaneously generating ancillary revenue streams for our media properties.
Extend sales efforts into new market segments
Given the competitive pressures in many of our “traditional” advertising categories, we have been expanding our network of advertiser relationships into not-for-profits, political advertising, corporate philanthropy, environmental initiatives and government agencies. These efforts primarily focus on the health care and education sectors. We believe our capabilities can address these clients’ under-served needs.
Enhance the efficiency of our operations
We believe it is essential that we operate our businesses as efficiently as possible. We regularly review our business operations and reduce costs or realign resources as necessary. We have also invested in technology solutions to help further streamline our business processes.
Pursue acquisition and investment opportunities
We may pursue acquisitions or other investment opportunities in a variety of media-related businesses as well as a variety of other industries and market sectors. We believe that consummating such acquisitions and investments can be a valuable tool in our efforts to grow our business.
Leverage the power of the brands
We believe our brands are well integrated within the Hip Hop and R&B marketplace. We will continue to expand our national reach on each of our brands through the digital, streaming, syndication and licensing arenas. Our celebrity talent has broad national and international influence and are integrated into key cultural moments, which help amplify our brands.
RADIO STATIONS
In the following table, “Market Rank by Revenue” is the ranking of the market revenue size of the principal radio market served by our stations among all radio markets in the United States. Market revenue rankings are from BIA’s Investing In Radio 2022, fourth edition. “Ranking in Primary Demographic Target” is the ranking of the station within its designated primary demographic target among all radio stations in its market based on the December 2022 Nielsen Audio, Inc. (“Nielsen”) Portable People Meter results. A “t” indicates the station tied with another station for the stated ranking. “Station Audience Share” represents a percentage generally computed by dividing the average number of persons in the primary demographic listening to a particular station during specified time periods by the average number of such persons in the primary demographic for all stations in the market area as determined by Nielsen.

WQHT(FM) | | Hip-Hop | 18-34 | 5 | 5.1 
WBLS(FM) | | Urban Adult Contemporary | 25-54 | 3 | 6.2 

RADIO ADVERTISING SALES
Our stations derive their advertising revenue from local and regional spot radio and digital advertising in the marketplaces in which they operate, as well as from the sale of national advertising. Local and most regional sales are made by a station’s sales staff. National sales are made by firms specializing in such sales, which are compensated on a commission-only basis. We believe that the volume of national advertising revenue tends to adjust to shifts in a station’s audience share position more rapidly than does the volume of local and regional advertising revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 22% of our total spot radio advertising revenues were derived from national sales and 78% were derived from local sales.
NON-TRADITIONAL REVENUES
Our stations are involved with numerous events in the market in which we operate, that support the local community, entertain our audiences, and better connect our listeners with our stations and our advertisers. In most cases, a third party produces the event, which we help promote, and we sell certain sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers. In these situations, we do not bear financial risk on the success of the event. In limited cases, such as Hot 97's Summer Jam, we produce the event, including securing the performing artists and venue, and are primarily responsible for the financial risk and reward, including ticket and sponsorship sales associated with the event.
NEW TECHNOLOGIES
We believe that the growth of new technologies not only presents challenges, but also opportunities for broadcasters. The primary challenge is increased competition for the time and attention of our listeners. The primary opportunity is to further enhance the relationships we already have with our listeners by expanding products and services offered by our radio stations to adjacent areas of entertainment, including streaming, gaming, and sports, and to increase audience reach via connected devices.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
We believe that to be successful, we must be integrally involved in the communities we serve. We see ourselves as community partners. To that end, our radio stations participate in many community programs, fundraisers and activities that benefit a wide variety of causes. Charitable organizations that have been the beneficiaries of our support include, among others, Hip Hop has Heart, the Harlem Chamber of Commerce, the Sarcoidosis Foundation, New York Cares, American AIDS Foundation and the Queens Police Service Area Community Counsel. We have embarked on a relationship with the Universal Hip Hop Museum, which is currently under construction in New York City.
In January 2022, we helped raise over $1 million by broadcasting a day-long fundraiser for the families impacted by the Bronx apartment fire at Twin Parks North-West.
COMPETITION
Radio broadcasting stations compete with the other broadcasting stations in their respective market areas, as well as with other advertising media such as newspapers, cable, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, the Internet, satellite radio, streaming services, direct marketing, and mobile and wireless device marketing. Competition within the broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual market areas, so that a station in one market (e.g., New York) does not generally compete with stations in other markets (e.g., Los Angeles). Our stations face competition from other stations with substantial financial resources, including stations targeting the same demographic groups. In addition to management experience, factors that are material to competitive position include the station's rank in its market in terms of the number of listeners, authorized power, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other stations in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position with programming and promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups targeted by our stations. We also seek to improve our position through sales efforts designed to attract advertisers that have done little or no radio advertising by emphasizing the effectiveness of radio advertising in increasing the advertisers' revenues. The policies and rules of the FCC permit certain joint ownership and joint operation of local stations. Our radio stations take advantage of these joint arrangements when appropriate to lower operating costs and to offer advertisers more attractive rates and services. Although we believe that each of our stations can compete effectively in its market, there can be no assurance that either of our stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience ratings or advertising revenue market share.
Although the broadcasting industry is highly competitive, barriers to entry exist. The operation of a broadcasting station in the United States requires a license from the FCC. Also, the number of stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of the frequencies that the FCC will license in that market, as well as by the FCC's multiple ownership rules regulating the number and types of stations that may be owned or controlled by the same person or company.
In selecting the form of media through which to advertise, advertisers evaluate their ability to target audiences having a specific demographic profile, lifestyle, brand or media consumption or purchasing behavior, or audiences located in, or traveling through, a particular geography. Advertisers also compare the relative costs of available media, evaluating the number of impressions (potential viewings), exposure (the opportunity for advertising to be seen) and circulation (traffic volume in a market), as well as potential effectiveness, quality of related services (such as advertising copy design and layout) and customer service. In competing with other media, we believe that radio is more cost-efficient than other media, allowing advertisers to reach broader audiences and target specific geographic areas or demographic groups within markets. Additionally, the strength of our digital reach and brand recognition allows us to compete for national digital advertising dollars.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our mission is to connect brands and consumers by delivering innovative advertising insights and solutions while enhancing our communities. We believe that our success is dependent upon successful execution of this mission, and a critical component in achieving this mission is attracting, motivating and retaining great people who allow us to continue to find new and innovative ways to serve our customers and our communities. We believe our key human capital management objective is to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent and subject matter experts in the sectors we operate. We believe an alignment between talent and strategy is key to scaling the business.
At December 31, 2022, we had 141 full-time and part-time employees, compared to 192 at December 31, 2021, at which earlier date 49 of which employees were employed in our disposed outdoor advertising business.
To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create strong teams and vibrant culture at every level of our organization through our core values of integrity, innovation, excellence and safety. We also strive to offer a fair and competitive compensation and benefits program, foster a community where everyone feels included and empowered to do their best work, provide a safe workplace, and give employees the opportunity to give back to their communities and make a social impact. We believe people can achieve their full potential when they enjoy their work, so it is our priority to provide a workplace where growth, success and fun go hand in hand. We are implementing annual goal-setting and performance management processes, as well as formal surveys of our employees on a periodic and ongoing basis to measure engagement and identify areas for improvement.
Code of Business Conduct
We are deeply committed to promoting a culture of ethical conduct and compliance. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all employees as well as officers and all members of the Board, reinforces our core values and helps drive our workplace culture of compliance with ethical standards, integrity and accountability. Training on the Code is mandatory upon employment and is provided on an annual basis. Highlights from our Code include a no retaliation policy for anyone who, acting in good faith, notifies us of a possible violation of the Code, our policies or the law; a commitment to human rights and labor protections in all of our operations, and the expectation that our business partners uphold the same standards; and an anti-corruption policy that prohibits offering, attempting to offer, authorizing or promising any bribe or kickback for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an unfair advantage.
Compensation and Benefits Programs
Our compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and reward talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business objectives, assist in the achievement of our strategic goals and create long-term value for our stockholders. We provide competitive packages to address the needs of the individuals we employ to ensure we have alignment with culture, expectations and value driven results. Our sales employees are incentivized through sales commission programs. Our executives and certain other employees receive long-term equity awards that vest over time. We believe that a compensation program with both short-term and long-term awards provides fair and competitive compensation and aligns employee and stockholder interests.
We also provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of healthcare and insurance benefits, qualified spending accounts, retirement savings plans and various other benefits.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. We respect and embrace diversity of thought and experience and believe that a diverse workforce produces more innovative insights and solutions, resulting in better products and services for our customers. As we bring brands face-to-face with people, we believe our teams need to be as diverse in their composition and outlook as the audiences we reach every day, and we work together to create an inclusive environment where everyone can bring their true selves to work. We work on building teams that reflect the life experiences of those we serve. Our teams align with our mission and values; of the 141 full-time and part-time employees driving the business, over 78% are Black, Hispanic, or Asian, and 43% are female.
Community Involvement
One of our guiding principles is making a difference in the communities we serve, and our corporate social responsibility initiatives are an important part of our culture. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. As a company, we endeavor to use our resources and products to drive meaningful societal change and have collaborated with local and national organizations globally to improve health and public safety; to ensure a sustainable environment; to promote arts, education and cultural diversity; and to support market-by-market advertising standards. MediaCo aims to be purposeful and do the right thing and over the years we have worked with our community to educate, understand, guide and amplify their voices to ensure our audience feels heard and appreciated.

FEDERAL REGULATION OF BROADCASTING
Radio broadcasting in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), including as amended in part by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “1996 Act”). Radio broadcasting is prohibited except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the public interest, convenience and necessity would be served by the grant of such license. The FCC has the power to revoke licenses for, among other things, false statements made in FCC filings or willful or repeated violations of the Communications Act or of FCC rules. In general, the Communications Act provides that the FCC shall allocate broadcast licenses for radio stations so as to provide a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of service throughout the United States. The FCC determines the operating frequency, location and power of stations; regulates the equipment used by stations; and regulates numerous other areas of radio broadcasting pursuant to rules, regulations and policies adopted under authority of the Communications Act. The Communications Act, among other things, prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of an entity holding such a license without the prior approval of the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of media that compete with broadcast stations.
The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act as well as FCC rules, public notices and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations. Legislation has been introduced from time to time which would amend the Communications Act in various respects or otherwise affect the Company, and the FCC from time to time considers new regulations or amendments to its existing regulations. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted or whether new or amended FCC regulations will be adopted or what their effect would be on the Company.
License Renewal
Radio stations operate pursuant to broadcast licenses that are ordinarily granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application and approval by the FCC. License renewal applications for both WQHT(FM) and WBLS(FM) were granted in July 2022. The following table sets forth our current FCC license expiration dates in addition to the call letters, license classification, antenna elevation above average terrain, power and frequency of all owned stations as of December 31, 2022:

Radio Market | Stations | City of License | Frequency | ExpirationDateof License | FCC Class | Height AboveAverageTerrain (in feet) | Power(in Kilowatts)
New York, NY | WQHT(FM) | New York, NY | 97.1 | June 2030 | B | 1,339 | 6.7 
 | WBLS(FM) | New York, NY | 107.5 | June 2030 | B | 1,362 | 4.2 

Review of Ownership Restrictions
The FCC is required by statute to review its broadcast ownership rules on a quadrennial basis (i.e., every four years) and to repeal or modify rules that are no longer “necessary in the public interest.”
Despite several such reviews and appellate remands, the FCC’s rules limiting the number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a local market have remained largely unchanged since their initial adoption following the 1996 Act. The FCC’s previous ownership reviews have been subject to litigation. In April 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a lower court decision blocking a number of FCC rule changes designed to update the FCC’s media ownership regulations. As a result, the FCC’s Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule, which limited the number of radio and television and stations that could be commonly owned in a single market, was eliminated.
The FCC initiated its 2018 quadrennial review in December 2018 and that proceeding remains pending. The 2022 quadrennial review was launched in December 2022 and that proceeding also remains pending. We cannot predict whether either of the quadrennial review proceedings will result in modifications of the ownership rules or the impact (if any) that such modifications would have on our business.
Attribution of Ownership Interests:
In applying its ownership rules, the FCC has developed specific criteria that it uses to determine whether a certain ownership interest or other relationship with an FCC licensee is significant enough to be “attributable” or “cognizable” under its rules, such that there would be a violation of the FCC’s rules where such person or entity holds attributable interests in more than the permitted number of stations or a prohibited combination of outlets in the same market. The FCC’s regulations generally deem the following relationships and interests to be attributable for purposes of its ownership restrictions:
•all officer and director positions in a licensee or its direct/indirect parent(s);
•voting stock interests of at least 5% (or 20%, if the holder is a passive institutional investor, i.e., a mutual fund, insurance company or bank);
•any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company where the limited partner or member has not been “insulated” from the media-related activities of the LP or LLC pursuant to specific FCC criteria;
•equity and/or debt interests which, in the aggregate, exceed 33% of the total asset value of a station or other media entity (the “equity/debt plus policy”), if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the station’s total weekly programming (usually pursuant to a time brokerage, local marketing or network affiliation agreement) or is a same-market media entity (i.e., a broadcast station).
To assess whether a voting stock interest in a direct or indirect parent corporation of a broadcast licensee is attributable, the FCC uses a “multiplier” analysis in which non-controlling voting stock interests are deemed proportionally reduced at each non-controlling link in a multi-corporation ownership chain.
Ownership-rule conflicts could require divestitures by either the Company or the affected shareholders, officers or directors. Such conflicts could also result in the Company being unable to obtain FCC consents necessary for future acquisitions. Conversely, the Company’s media interests could operate to restrict other media investments by shareholders having or acquiring an interest in the Company.
Local Radio Ownership:
The local radio ownership rule limits the number of commercial radio stations in a radio market in which a person or entity may hold an attributable interest based on the number of radio stations in that market:
•if the market has 45 or more radio stations, one entity may own up to eight stations, not more than five of which may be in the same service (AM or FM);
•if the market has between 30 and 44 radio stations, one entity may own up to seven stations, not more than four of which may be in the same service;
•if the market has between 15 and 29 radio stations, one entity may own up to six stations, not more than four of which may be in the same service; and
•if the market has 14 or fewer radio stations, one entity may own up to five stations, not more than three of which may be in the same service, however one entity may not own more than 50% of the stations in the market.
The New York radio market has more than 45 radio stations.
For purposes of applying these numerical limits, the FCC has adopted rules with respect to (i) so-called local marketing agreements, or “LMAs,” by which the licensee of one radio station provides programming for another licensee’s radio station in the same market and sells all of the advertising within that programming and (ii) so-called joint sale agreements, or “JSAs,” by which the licensee of one station sells the advertising time on another station in the market. Under these rules, an entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time, or sells more than 15% of the advertising time, on another radio station in the same market pursuant to an LMA or JSA is generally required to count the station toward its media ownership limits even though it does not own the station. As a result, in a market where we own one or more radio stations, we generally cannot provide programming to another station under an LMA, or sell advertising on another station pursuant to a JSA, if we could not acquire that station under the local radio ownership rule.
In the 2018 and 2022 quadrennial review proceedings, the FCC is considering all aspects of the local radio ownership rule, including whether the rule in its current form remains necessary in the public interest.
Alien Ownership:
Alien Ownership: Under the Communications Act, no FCC license may be held by a corporation if more than one-fifth of its capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, a foreign government or representative thereof, or an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country (collectively, “Non-U.S. Persons”). Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC license may be granted to an entity directly or indirectly controlled by another entity of which more than one-fourth of its capital stock is owned or voted by Non-U.S. Persons if the FCC finds that the public interest will be served by the denial of such license. The FCC has adopted rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees and has revised the methodology that publicly traded broadcasters must use to assess their compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions. The foregoing restrictions on alien ownership apply in modified form to other types of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Code of By-Laws authorize the Board of Directors to prohibit such restricted alien ownership, voting or transfer of capital stock as would cause the Company to violate the Communications Act or FCC regulations.
Assignments and Transfers of Control
The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant such approval, the FCC considers a number of factors, including compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the “character” of the assignee or transferee and those persons holding attributable interests therein and compliance with the Communications Act’s limitations on alien ownership as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements. When evaluating an assignment or transfer of control application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment of the broadcast license or transfer of control of the licensee to a party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application.
Programming and Operations
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” Beginning in the late 1970s, the FCC gradually relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station’s community of license. However, licensees are still required to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness.
Federal law prohibits the broadcast of obscene material at any time and the broadcast of indecent material during specified time periods. Federal law also imposes sponsorship identification (or “payola”) requirements, which mandate the disclosure of information concerning programming the airing of which is paid for by third parties. The company may receive letters of inquiry or other notifications concerning alleged violations of the FCC’s rules at its stations. We cannot predict the outcome of any complaint proceeding or investigation or the extent or nature of any future FCC enforcement action.
Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identification, equal employment opportunities, contest promotions, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation.
Failure to observe FCC rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary fines, the grant of “short-term” (less than the maximum term) license renewals or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license.
Additional Developments and Proposed Changes
The FCC has adopted rules implementing a low power FM (“LPFM”) service, and over 2000 such stations have been licensed. In November 2007, the FCC adopted rules that, among other things, enhance LPFM’s interference protection from subsequently-authorized full-service stations. Congress then passed legislation eliminating certain minimum distance separation requirements between full-power and LPFM stations, thereby reducing the interference protection afforded to full-power FM stations. As required by the legislation, the FCC in January 2012 submitted a report to Congress indicating that the results of a statutorily mandated economic study indicated that, on the whole, LPFM stations do not currently have, and in the future are unlikely to have, a demonstrable economic impact on full-service commercial FM radio stations. The FCC has since modified its rules to permit the processing of additional LPFM applications and to implement the legislative requirements regarding interference protection, and has accepted applications seeking authority to construct or make major changes to LPFM facilities. Although to date there have been very few, if any, instances of LPFM stations interfering with full-power radio stations, we cannot predict whether any LPFM stations will actually interfere with the coverage of our radio stations in the future.
The FCC also previously authorized the launch and operation of a satellite digital audio radio service (“SDARS”) system. The country’s single SDARS operator, Sirius XM, provides nationwide programming service as well as channels that provide local traffic and weather information for major cities.
In addition, the FCC permits terrestrial digital audio broadcasting (“DAB,” also known as high definition radio or “HD Radio®”) by FM stations, and in October 2020, adopted rules permitting all-digital operations by AM stations.
In order to broadcast musical compositions or to stream them over the Internet, we must pay royalties to copyright owners of musical compositions (typically, songwriters and publishers). These copyright owners often rely on organizations known as performing rights organizations, which negotiate licenses with copyright users for the public performance of their compositions, collect royalties, and distribute them to copyright owners. The three major performing rights organizations, from which the Company has licenses and to which we pay royalties, are the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), and SESAC, Inc. These rates are set periodically, are often negotiated by organizations acting on behalf of broadcasters, and may increase in the future. It also is possible that songwriters or publishers may disassociate with these performing rights organizations, or that additional such organizations could emerge in the future. In 2013 a new performing rights organization named Global Music Rights (“GMR”) was formed. GMR has obtained the rights to certain high-value copyrights and has negotiated individual licensing agreements with radio stations for songs within its repertoire. If a significant number of musical composition copyright owners withdraw from the established performing rights organizations, if new performing rights organizations form to license compositions that are not already licensed, or if the consent decrees between the DOJ and ASCAP/BMI are materially modified or eliminated, our royalty rates or negotiation costs could increase.
In order to stream music over the Internet, MediaCo must also obtain licenses and pay royalties to the owners of copyrights in sound recordings (typically, artists and record companies). These royalties are in addition to royalties for Internet streaming that must be paid to performance rights organizations.
Legislation also has regularly been introduced in Congress that would require the payment of performance royalties to artists, musicians, or record companies whose music is played on terrestrial radio stations, ending a long-standing copyright law exception. If enacted, such legislation could have an adverse impact on the cost of music programming.
Congress and the FCC also have under consideration, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of additional matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations and/or affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters include, but are not limited to:
•proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees;
