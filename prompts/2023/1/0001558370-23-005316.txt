ITEM 1. Business
Overview of our Business
Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment provides premium content to value-conscious consumers. The Company is one of the largest advertising-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) companies in the US, with three flagship AVOD streaming services: Redbox, Crackle and Chicken Soup for the Soul. In addition, the company operates Redbox Free Live TV, a free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) service with over 160 channels as well as a transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) service, and a network of approximately 32,000 kiosks across the U.S. for DVD rentals. To provide original and exclusive content to its viewers, the company creates, acquires, and distributes films and TV series through its Screen Media and Chicken Soup for the Soul TV Group subsidiaries. The company’s best-in-class ad sales organization is known to advertisers as Crackle Plus, a sales platform of unique scale and differentiated reach. Crackle Plus combines the ad inventory of our owned-and-operated networks and inventory with over 20 other premium AVOD partners who have chosen us to represent them in the marketplace. Across Redbox, Crackle, Chicken Soup for the Soul and Screen Media, the Company has access to almost 70,000 content assets. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment is a subsidiary of Chicken Soup for the Soul, LLC, which publishes the famous books series and produces super-premium pet food under the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand name.
Our AVOD services boast approximately 50 million monthly active users and are distributed through every major distribution platform including Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Samsung, Vizio, Xbox, PlayStation and many more. Our consumers view content produced through our various television production affiliates, acquired by Screen Media, or licensed from Sony Pictures Television (SPT), Lionsgate, Paramount, Fox, Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney and more than 100 other production and distribution companies, as well as through our media partners. Crackle is among the most watched ad-supported independent VOD streaming services and has multiple branded FAST networks, all of which offer consumers free TV series and movies. Crackle is known for premium original and acquired content that delivers audiences of scale across a demographic spectrum.

Through our recently launched Chicken Soup for the Soul AVOD streaming service and FAST channel, we offer original and acquired unscripted lifestyle and scripted series and theatrical content that appeals to women and families. 
The acquisition of Redbox in August 2022 added another established brand and leading home entertainment provider to the Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment portfolio of companies. For over 20 years, Redbox has focused on providing U.S. customers with the best value in entertainment and the most choice in how they consume it, through physical media and/or digital services. Through its physical media business, consumers can rent or purchase new-release DVDs and Blu-ray Discs® from its nationwide network of approximately 32,000 self-service kiosks. In the recent past, Redbox transformed from a pure-play DVD rental company to a multi-faceted entertainment company, providing additional value and choice to consumers through multiple digital products across a variety of content windows. The Redbox digital business includes Redbox On Demand, a TVOD service offering digital rental and purchase of new release and catalog movies; Redbox Free On Demand, an AVOD service providing free movies and TV shows on demand; and Redbox Free Live TV, a FAST service providing consumers access to over 160 linear channels. Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment also generates revenue through its Redbox Service business by providing installation, merchandising and break-fix services to other kiosk operators, and via Crackle Plus, selling third-party display advertising within Redbox’s mobile app, website, and e-mails, as well as display and digital advertising at the kiosk.
Screen Media manages one of the industry’s largest independently owned television and film libraries consisting of approximately 20,000 films and television episodes. Screen Media also acquires approximately 10 to 20 new feature films and a few hundred genre titles each year. Screen Media provides content for the Crackle Plus portfolio and also distributes its library to other exhibitors and third-party networks to generate additional revenue and operating cash flow. Our Halcyon Television subsidiary manages the extensive film and television library we acquired from Sonar Entertainment in 2021. This library is distributed by Screen Media and contains more than 1,000 titles, and 4,000 hours of programming, ranging from classics, including The Little Rascals, Laurel & Hardy and Blondie (produced by Hal Roach Studios), to acclaimed epic event mini-series such as Lonesome Dove and Dinotopia. Our Halcyon library titles have received 446 Emmy Award nominations, 105 Emmy Awards and 15 Golden Globe Awards. In March of 2022, Screen Media acquired 1091 Pictures that added approximately 4,000 films and episodes of licensed content as well as established FAST and AVOD channels in genre specific verticals with approximately 1 billion yearly ad-impressions.
 Chicken Soup for the Soul Television Group houses our film and television production activities and produces or co-produces original content for Crackle Plus as well as content for other third-party networks. This group’s production efforts are conducted through a number of affiliates, including Landmark Studio Group Chicken Soup for the Soul Studios, Indian-centric Locomotive Global Inc., and Halcyon Studios, which was formed in connection with our acquisition of the assets of Sonar Entertainment. Halcyon Studios develops, produces, finances, and distributes high-caliber scripted content for our company for all platforms across a broad spectrum in the U.S. and internationally, including premium series such as Hunters (Amazon Prime) and Mysterious Benedict Society (Disney+).
Collectively, Screen Media and Chicken Soup for the Soul Television Group enable us to acquire, produce, co-produce and distribute content, including our original and exclusive content, in support of our streaming services. We believe that we are the only scaled independent AVOD business with the proven capability to acquire, create and distribute original programming, and that we have one of the largest libraries of company-owned and third-party content in the AVOD industry. We believe this differentiation is important as consumers materially shift their viewing habits from traditional network-scheduled, linear and broadcast viewing to individual, personalized on-demand viewing in response to the ever-growing availability of high-speed content delivery across devices.
The U.S. market for AVOD and FAST saw record revenues approaching $17 billion in 2022 up approximately 40% from 2021. The industry projections have these revenues growing to $31 billion by 2027 in the U.S. and closer to $70 billion worldwide. At the same time, advertising spending on traditional linear television networks is expected to decline as more viewers transition from pay television subscriptions to connected TV (CTV) viewing. For these reasons, interest in the AVOD business model is increasing, evidenced by traditional linear network operators increasingly seeking to acquire or launch AVOD networks to maintain access to viewers making this transition and established SVOD players expanding their offerings to include a hybrid AVOD that in most cases still requires a subscription fee. We believe free AVOD networks will continue to accelerate growth, particularly as consumers seek affordable programming alternatives to multiple SVOD offerings.
Since our inception in January 2015, our business has grown rapidly. For the full year 2022, our net revenue was $252.8 million, as compared to the full year 2021 net revenue of $110.4 million. Our 2022 Adjusted EBITDA was approximately 

5



$33.5 million, as compared to 2021 Adjusted EBITDA of $21.8 million. We had net losses of approximately $(111.3) million in 2022, as compared to net losses of $(59.4) million in 2021. As described below in “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure”, we use Adjusted EBITDA as an important metric for management. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition” and “Item 8. Financial Statements” for more information.
Our Strategy
We believe our company is in a differentiated position within the growing and evolving television industry, as we execute our strategy to become the leading provider of premium entertainment for value-conscious consumers. We identified the trends favoring the growth of free AVOD streaming services in 2015 and began building our direct-to-consumer (DTC) offering in 2017, including the development of our original content production strategy. Since then, with Crackle and Chicken Soup for the Soul, we have built premier ad-supported streaming services that deliver utility and value to viewers and advertisers. With the addition of Redbox, we have added an iconic and beloved brand that enhances our existing leadership in the AVOD landscape. Redbox’s connected TV app boasts a robust and integrated ad-supported VOD and free live TV (FAST) service. Redbox’s DVD rental kiosks and connected TV transactional VOD businesses are perfectly positioned to capitalize on the post-COVID resurgence of theatricals at the box-office. This combination of assets elevates our newly combined company within the marketplace to a top 5 AVOD business and top 4 TVOD platform. We believe Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment has the advantage of being unencumbered by the often-conflicting strategic choices and priorities faced by diversified media companies that own both legacy linear television networks and VOD streaming services intended to compete with legacy networks. We are singularly focused on the value-conscious consumer and serving that consumer with unique and differentiated offerings that feature a range of mass-appeal and thematic content, a focus on original and exclusive content, and which employ innovative user platforms and data analytics to deliver more personalized viewing experiences and more engaging advertising. We are executing on our strategy in multiple ways:

● | Content: Maximize transactional revenue and cost-effectively grow our production business, our content library, and our ownership of content rights.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Transactional revenue. As films exit the theatrical window, they enter the home video window in which we are dominant player offering rentals and sales across both physical and TVOD. We are focused on maximizing and accelerating transactional content revenue for both our Redbox physical and digital businesses. As the volume, quality and cadence of significant theatrical releases returns to pre-COVID levels, we expect to drive DVD rentals and sales higher at our vast national kiosk network, as well as continue growing our TVOD rentals and sales.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Original & exclusive programming. Our focus on “original and exclusive” content, supported by our distribution and production business, is designed to distinguish our AVOD network brands among viewers. We are able to add to our existing broad base of content without the significant capital outlay of a traditional television or film studio by producing new originals at low cost through creative partnerships, such as our popular series Going from Broke from executive producer Ashton Kutcher, and Inside The Black Box, our innovative and award-winning look inside black Hollywood.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Content acquisition and rights ownership. Through Screen Media, we continue to acquire the rights to additional exclusive content. This strategy reduces our reliance on content licensing, which leads to lower costs of revenue and increased gross margin and provides us with wider distribution opportunities to generate additional revenue. When economically attractive, we often, from time to time, choose to sell all or a subset of rights of an individual title in our content library to generate funds to keep our overall investment in content cost effective and maximize returns to our investors. We consider all sources of content recoupment revenue, including ancillary revenues and intellectual property infringement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Advertising: Utilize technology and data to deliver innovative advertising formats and relevant ads that engage viewers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Advertiser-desired audience profile. We believe we enjoy strong relationships with leading advertisers based on our demographic reach, our sales approach, and our commitment to premium content and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

innovative, engaging ad formats. Our networks offer advertisers a desirable target audience. For example, the average age of our Crackle viewers is 33, compared to 58 for traditional broadcast networks, and 54 for advertising-supported cable networks. We estimate that 32% of our viewers fall in the 18-34 age demographic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Diverse sales channels. We employ a diverse and targeted advertising sales strategy, using direct, local reseller and programmatic sales channels to provide us with optionality based on market conditions. Most of our advertising revenues are derived from direct sales and local reseller agreements, which we believe give us greater margin contribution and control over our advertising avails than is possible with traditional programmatic advertising. The majority of our programmatic advertising sales are sold by our direct sales force and executed programmatically, providing greater insights and data to our customers, resulting in higher-than-normal programmatic CPMs.

o | Technology investment. As we grow our portfolio of streaming services, we continue to upgrade our entire suite of streaming applications to add value for advertisers and enhance the user experience, including more intuitive navigation, enhanced video players, seamless ad insertion and better content recommendation engines. As we execute on these initiatives, we believe we will be positioned to increase both overall advertising sales and ad insertion rates, firmly establishing our streaming services as a compelling option for advertisers compared to traditional linear broadcast or cable networks.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct-to-consumer (DTC): Grow distribution to gain new viewers and employ sophisticated data analytics to deliver more compelling experiences.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Content and Distribution. We exploit our growing libraries of premium content to grow and retain viewers on our streaming services. To augment audience acquisition, we have engaged in distribution arrangements with an increasing number of media platforms including Roku, Amazon Fire, Vizio, Samsung, LG and others, as well as increased advertising and branding on and off media platforms. For example, we have distribution partnerships with Vizio and Hisense for Crackle and Redbox buttons on millions of new television remote controls sold over the next year, which increases consumer awareness of Crackle and Redbox and guides them directly to our connected TV apps.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | New Genre-Specific Networks. With the addition of Redbox, we now own and operate 15 clearly branded, curated and widely distributed FAST channels. As we grow our content libraries, we are also continuously evaluating opportunities to create new thematic AVOD and FAST networks that focus on certain genres and types of programming, and we expect these networks to deliver more targeted advertising opportunities to marketers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Personalized Viewer Experiences. As we grow our audience, we are creating a large, valuable data base that we use to better understand what our viewers watch and how they engage with advertising. We are increasingly investing in capabilities to manage and analyze our data with the goal of better personalizing viewer experiences and enabling targeted advertising.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business-to-business (B2B): Accelerate revenue for the Company’s B2B initiatives in key areas.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Redbox Service Business. Redbox supports its 32,000-strong DVD kiosk network with a nationwide field team that handles on-site break-fix and maintenance along with the stocking of merchandise. In 2016, to maximize personnel, resources, and generate new revenue, Redbox began using its kiosk team to also service third-party kiosks. This initial test of capabilities has flourished and is now a sophisticated and fast-growing service business for multiple third-party companies with thousands of kiosks, including ecoATM and Coinstar. We are focused on the growth of the Redbox Service Business and expect the strength of its positive trajectory to continue.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Crackle Plus. As the first AVOD of scale, Crackle has always been in a leadership position. But we realized several years ago that smaller independent AVODs were disadvantaged in the marketplace. Without scale and a volume of impressions, some players struggled to gain the attention of agencies and clients. As AVODs approached our Company for assistance in ad sales, we found there was a healthy, growing and profitable business in representing third-party networks and their inventory with advertisers. Crackle Plus now manages ad sales for over 20 other AVODs. We expect the number of
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

partners to continue to grow, which benefits the Company’s scale and revenue, as well as our affiliated AVODs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Screen Media Ventures (SMV). While Screen Media’s primary goal is to acquire content for our owned-and-operated networks, SMV’s distribution team works with our networks to optimally window content and license it to third parties wherever possible. Through this strategy, SMV has become a leading content provider for third-party streaming and linear networks. The Company expects to continue this fly-wheel of content acquisitions that leads to monetization through content licensing.

Competition
We are in a highly competitive business. The market for streaming entertainment is rapidly changing. We face competition from companies within the entertainment business and from alternative forms of leisure entertainment, such as travel, sporting events, outdoor recreation, video games, the internet and other cultural and computer-related activities. We compete for viewers and programming with companies such as Netflix, HBO Max, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, Fox, and major film and television studios. We also compete with numerous independent motion picture and television distribution and production companies, television networks, pay television systems and online media platforms for viewers, subscribers, and the services of performing artists, producers and other creative and technical personnel and production financing, all of which are essential to the success of our businesses. 
 In addition, our video content competes for media outlet and audience acceptance with video content produced and distributed by other companies. As a result, the success of any of our video content is dependent not only on the quality and acceptance of a particular production, but also on the quality and acceptance of other competing video content available in the marketplace at or near the same time.
 Given such competition, and our stage of development, we emphasize a lower cost structure, risk mitigation, reliance on financial partnerships and innovative financial strategies. We rely on our flexibility and agility as well as the entrepreneurial spirit of our employees, partners and affiliates, in order to provide creative, desirable video content.
Intellectual Property
We are party to the “CSS License Agreement,” (as defined) through which we have been granted the perpetual, exclusive, worldwide license by CSS to exclusively exhibit, produce and distribute video content using the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand and related content, such as stories published in the Chicken Soup for the Soul books. Chicken Soup for the Soul and related names are trademarks owned by CSS. We have the proprietary rights (including copyrights) in all company-produced content and believe the Brand provides a competitive advantage in attracting advertisers and entertainment talent. As a result of the acquisitions of Screen Media, Crackle, the assets of Sonar Entertainment, 1091 Pictures and the licensing of other libraries we now own copyrights or long-term distribution rights and AVOD rights to approximately 110,000 programming assets totaling over 94,000 programming hours.
 We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, which are described more fully in the section titled “Risk Factors”.
Human Capital Management
At Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, we aim to bring out the best of our employees and consultants. We are committed to developing our employees and encourage and facilitate the development of our employees through our People Operations department. We depend on a highly educated and skilled workforce. We seek to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment for all employees. Our ability to attract, develop and retain the best talent, is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our businesses.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,329 direct employees. The services of certain personnel, including our chairman and chief executive officer and our senior brand advisor and director, among others, are provided to us under the Management Services Agreement dated May 12, 2016, between us and CSS (“CSS Management Agreement”). We also utilize consultants in the ordinary course of our business and hire additional personnel on a project-by-project basis. We believe that our employee and labor relations are good, and we are committed to inclusion and strict policies and procedures to maintain a safe work environment. We have taken measures to protect our workforce in response to the COVID-19 

8



pandemic, including allowing employees to work from home when possible and implementing safety protocols to support our employees required to work onsite.

We value our employees and invest in them and their communities. Recently, we joined a growing group of companies working with Good Today to enable our employees to participate in supporting non-profit organizations to support initiatives that have a positive global impact.
