Item 1: Description of Business

Genvor Incorporated (the “Company” or “Genvor”) was incorporated in Florida on September 26, 2018, as “Allure Worldwide, Inc.,” and as of November 18, 2019, redomiciled to Nevada. On June 24, 2022, the Company changed its name to from “Allure Worldwide, Inc.” to “Genvor Incorporated.”

The Company was originally formed with the intention of seeking to acquire the assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues, in exchange for its securities. On January 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Genvor Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Genvor”) to acquire (the “Acquisition”) Genvor. On March 2, 2022, the Company and Genvor entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) to consummate the Acquisition, and pursuant to which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Genvor Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, would merge (the “Merger”) with and into Genvor, with each share of Genvor common stock issued immediately prior to the time of the merger automatically converted into the right to receive one share of common stock of the Company.

On May 27, 2022, the Acquisition closed, Merger Subsidiary merged with and into Genvor, each share of Genvor was exchanged for the right to receive one share of Company common stock, 35,261,871 shares of Company common stock were issued to Genvor’s pre-merger shareholders (the “Merger Shares”), constituting a change of control of the Company, and Genvor became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of these transactions, the Company had 55,261,871 issued and outstanding common shares upon the closing of the share exchange with Genvor, and subsequently the Company’s original founding shareholders cancelled 18,144,112 shares of Company common stock in connection with the Acquisition.

As a result of the Acquisition, the Company’s business plan is that of Genvor, and the Company is developing plant-based defense technology designed to help farmers achieve global food security.

Genvor History

The Company’s subsidiary, Genvor Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 4, 2019, as “Nexion Biosciences Inc.,” and on January 22, 2020, its name was changed to “Genvor Inc.” Genvor Inc. develops plant-based defense technology designed to help farmers achieve global food security.

During May 2019, Genvor Inc. acquired Nexion Biosciences LLC (“NBLLC”) from a founder for nominal consideration. NBLLC was formed in the State of Delaware on December 28, 2018.

Genvor’s technology was developed by two university scientists, Dr. Clayton Yates and Dr. Jesse Jaynes, who shared a mission to develop crop protection technology designed to defend against crop diseases effecting both animals and humans alike. Genvor’s technology is currently being advanced by the USDA in corn seed varieties and with U.S. Sugar in citrus trees.

Genvor’s headquarters is located at 13155 Noel Road, Suite 900, Dallas, Texas, 75240.

Genvor’s Plan of Operation

The United States Food and Agriculture Organization reports that annual global crop losses due to plant pathogens and viruses are now estimated to exceed $100 billion. Alarming to the FDA are the fungi “Aspergillus Flavus,” which produce Aflatoxins, a toxic and carcinogenic compound known to cause liver cancer in humans and animals. Aspergillus Flavus is also the second leading cause of “aspergillosis” in humans. Patients infected with Aspergillus flavus often have reduced or compromised immune systems.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates the annual cost of Aflatoxin contamination in the United States at approximately $500 million through two categories of loss: market rejection and animal health impacts. As a result, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has imposed strict guidelines for crop inspection and discovery of diseased crops caused by Aflatoxins. Both planted fields and harvested crops that are found to be contaminated beyond permitted testing levels must be destroyed. As a result, farmers and growers can be exposed to catastrophic economic losses. This Aflatoxin problem has created a significant opportunity for agricultural companies who can develop the technology needed to defend against Aflatoxins.

Genvor’s Solution

Genvor’s technology is the only known solution that Genvor is aware of, which Genvor believes provides broad spectrum effectiveness against Aspergillus Flavus and Aflatoxins. This technology is deliverable by both bioengineered seed trait, as well as through biopesticide application.

Dr. Jaynes, one of Genvor’s founders, has been on a 30+ year quest to find a global crop solution for defense against Aflatoxins. As a result of successful testing and collaboration between Dr. Jaynes and the United States Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Research Service (USDA-ARS), the USDA-ARS awarded Genvor with a Cooperative Research & Development Agreement in August of 2018. The stated goal of this agreement is to develop and commercialize disease resistant and nutritionally enhanced corn seed varieties using Genvor’s seed trait technology.

Seed Traits

In the United States, the adoption of crop seeds with enhanced traits has been staggering. Currently, over 90 percent of U.S. corn, cotton and soybeans are produced using seeds with enhanced traits. Trait fees for these three crops alone represent over $2 billion annually based on an average trait fee of $13 per acre on approximately 170 million acres. U.S. corn crops alone account for roughly $1.2 billion of the estimated $2 billion.
Biopesticides

Biopesticides are one of the fastest-growing crop protection market sectors, increasing at twice the compound annual growth rate of the crop protection market as a whole. Primary drivers of this growth include a rising global demand for organic foods, the trend in the reduction of chemical residues, stricter import and supermarket standards, shorter pre-harvest intervals, a push for sustainability, and the demand for additional modes of action for managing resistance. The biopesticide market in north America alone is currently estimated to be over $4.8 billion annually.

Genvor’s technology is effective with corn seed and is believed by Genvor to be effective with many known crop types, and the technology may be delivered as a topical spray in the form of a biopesticide.

Genvor Incorporated (“Genvor” or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Florida on September 26, 2018,
