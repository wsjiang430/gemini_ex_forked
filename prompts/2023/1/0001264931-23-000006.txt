ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
On May 16, 2011, we transferred, through a spin-off to our then wholly owned subsidiary, Worlds Online Inc. (currently named MariMed Inc.), the majority of our operations and related operational assets. On January 18, 2022 we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Thom Kidrin, our CEO, for the IP that was transferred over to MariMed Inc. Mr. Kidrin received the IP through a settlement agreement that he reached with MariMed Inc. The assets purchased include: Worlds’ technology platform, Worlds Ultimate Chat, Aerosmith World, DMC Worlds, Cinema Virtual, Pearson contracts and related revenue, URLs: Worlds.com, Cybersexworld.com, Hang.com, and Worldsfunds.com, a digital inventory of over 10,000 3D objects, animation sequences, an extensive avatar library, texture maps and virtual world architectures.
 
Commencing in 2022, we will be focused on monetizing our collection of non-fungible tokens and our legacy celebrity virtual reality worlds. 
 
As of December 31, 2022, we own 549,697 shares of MariMed Inc. common stock.
 
Before the spin-off, Worlds was a leading 3D entertainment portal which leveraged its proprietary technology, which we retained through our patent portfolio, to offer visitors a network of virtual, multi-user environments which we call "worlds". These worlds are visually engaging online environments featuring animation, motion and content where people can come together and, by navigating through the website, shop, interact with others, attend events and be entertained. In support of this portal and the overall business strategy, we design and develop software, content and related technology for the creation of interactive, three-dimensional ("3D") Internet web sites. Using our technology, we created our own Internet sites, as well as sites available through third-party online service providers.
 
Recent developments

The Company has sought damages for patent infringement of the Company’s patents.  The Company's lawsuit against the Activision entities was filed in 2012. On April 30, 2021, Judge Casper granted Activision’s summary judgment motion, entered an Order finding that all asserted patents were invalid as directed to patent-ineligible subject matter, and terminated the Company’s lawsuit, with judgment for the Activision Entities.  The Company appealed this Order on May 28, 2021 to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, sitting in Washington, D.C.  On March 10, 2022, the Federal Circuit issued an Order affirming the District Court’s judgment. On June 8, 2022, the Company petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari, which is the process required for asking the Supreme Court to review the judgment of the Federal Circuit. 
 
The Company was notified on October 4, 2022, that the Supreme Court denied the Petition for a writ of certiorari. The Company has exhausted all legal remedies in this patent infringement case.
 
Our Technology
 
We used our technology to produce three-dimensional portals and web sites. We believe that our core technology delivers a considerably faster frame rate for user experiences and, in some cases, a meaningful productivity increase in art production and integration over its previous generation production tools. Our technology permits the development of virtual worlds which have broad applications. These applications include but are not limited to:

• | a virtual meeting place (such as a fan club); 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | a 3D e-commerce store (where merchandise can be viewed in 3D and purchased online); and 
• | a virtual classroom (where content can be viewed via video streaming and then discussed in real time).

Our core technology has substantial elements written in Sun Microsystem's programming language, Java, including WorldsBrowser and WorldsShaper, so we expect that it can be made portable across Windows and UNIX Platforms because of Java's platform independence.
 
Our core technology includes:
 

• | WorldsShaper: WorldsShaper is the visual authoring component of our platform. It allows for quick assembly of pieces to create multi-user, shared state, virtual worlds. The WorldsShaper is an advanced compositing 3D building tool that integrates pre-existing or custom content, such as 3D models, textures or images created in Adobe's Photoshop, or midi or wave sound files, with architectural geometry and interactive behaviors and actions written in Java. The architectural building blocks for creating 3D worlds, the flexibility and power of integrating professional modeling and imaging tools, and the extensibility via Java make the WorldsShaper a tool well-suited for rapid creation of 3D environments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsServer: WorldsServer is the scalable software that we use to control and operate our on-line virtual communities. WorldsServer manages the registration and authentication of users, the locations of users within the 3D environment, the physical structure of the 3D environment, all information regarding objects that are "shared" by the participants and any of the interactions between the users such as text chat. This platform also integrates an HTTP server for the delivery of other content such as audio and video streaming and secure e-commerce applications.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsBrowser: WorldsBrowser is used to access the 3D environments. The browser is optimized for speed, delivering relatively fast frame rates per second in highly textured virtual 3D worlds.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | WorldsPlayer™: The WorldsPlayer allows users to view and experience our multi-user, interactive technology. Any world created with the WorldsShaper will be viewable and navigable with the WorldsPlayer. The WorldsPlayer has a high frame rate for fast, quality graphics, an easy-to-use graphic user interface, 2D web browser integration, automatic upgrade capability over the internet and a complete communication tool set including text chat, voice-to-voice chat, e-mail and animation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Worlds Gamma Libraries: The Worlds Gamma Libraries are composed of sample worlds, textures, models, avatars, actions, sensors, sounds, motion sequences, and other behaviors.

Our Strategy
 
Worlds Inc. will be focused on monetizing our collection of non-fungible tokens and our legacy celebrity virtual reality worlds. The company is exploring strategic alliances with state of the art virtual reality platforms to refocus our positioning in the VR/AR market returning to the genesis of the company. These new platforms, if successfully developed and marketed, would enable to company to leverage its existing software assets and industry relationships.
 
Competition
 
Since all operations were transferred to Worlds Online and our business is now monetizing our collection of non-fungible tokens, the Company does not have any direct competition as it did in the past.
 
Currently, there are many companies collaborating to establish standardization of 3D usage on the Internet, the adoption of which may require changes to our technology.
 
Intellectual Property
 
U.S. Patents: Worlds has been granted U.S patent 6,219,045, 7,181,690, 7,493,558, 7,945,856, 8,082,501, 8,145,998, 8,161,385, 8,407,592 and 8,640,028 for multi-server technology for 3D applications, which is our core technology.  While the patents have all expired, we continue looking into the implications and breadth of the patent in order to maximize their benefits as well as our catalog of non-fungible tokens and our legacy celebrity worlds.
 
Trademark: Worldsplayer - The WorldsPlayer is especially designed to allow users to view and experience the multi-user, interactive Worlds Gamma technology.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had one full time employee, our president and chief executive officer, Thomas Kidrin.
 
Corporate History
 
We were formed as a result of the contemporaneous mergers on December 3, 1997 of Worlds Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on April 26, 1994 with and into Worlds Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation formed on April 8, 1997 and of Worlds Acquisition Corp. with and into Academic Computer Systems, Inc., a New Jersey corporation formed on May 20, 1968 (the "Mergers"). Academic Computer Systems changed its name to Worlds Inc. after the Mergers. In December 1999, we changed our name from Worlds Inc. to Worlds.com Inc. in order to better reflect our business as a consumer Internet web site that offers virtual "worlds" in which consumers interact, conduct e-commerce and receive entertainment. 
 
The Company created a wholly-owned subsidiary named Worlds Online Inc. on January 25, 2011. On May 16, 2011, Worlds Inc. transferred to Worlds Online Inc. the majority of its operations and related operational assets, except for its patent portfolio.
