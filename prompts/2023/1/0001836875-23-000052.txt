Nuvve is leading the electrification of the planet, beginning with transportation. Founded on the need to store and optimize renewable energy sources, we believe that electrification will unlock the benefits of clean energy and the profound impact it will have on our society and the planet.
Nuvve has introduced a new model for electrification through our intelligent energy platform. Nuvve offers deep expertise and technical solutions that make electric vehicles more sophisticated, efficient, and cost-effective. Combining the world’s most advanced vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology and our ecosystem of partners, Nuvve dynamically manages power among EV batteries and the grid. Together, these networked batteries serve as expanded capacity to supplement shifting energy needs and contribute to a more resilient grid. When the world’s batteries are intelligently connected, everyone has an opportunity to share in the benefits of an electrified world. Nuvve is delivering new value to owners, accelerating the adoption of EVs and the world’s transition to clean energy.
Since its founding in 2010, Nuvve has been responsible for successful V2G projects on five continents and is deploying commercial services worldwide.
Overview of Nuvve’s Technology
The Nuvve platform dynamically manages power to and from EVs and the grid at scale. Our intelligent vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology allows owners to efficiently meet the energy demands of individual vehicles and entire fleets. With Nuvve, the grid becomes more resilient through the benefits of greater networked battery capacity.
Nuvve’s Grid Integrated Vehicle (GIVe) software platform enables it to aggregate multiple EV batteries into a virtual power plant (VPP) to provide bidirectional services to the electrical grid in a qualified and secure manner. VPPs can generate revenue by selling excess power to utility companies, utilizing the stored power to perform grid services, or reduce building energy peak consumption. Nuvve is capable of providing many levels of vehicle-grid integration (VGI) and V2G services such as time of use optimization (“TOU”), demand response, demand charge management and wholesale energy market participation, thereby providing revenues from grid services as well as utility bill savings behind the meter.
Nuvve’s longest running commercial operation is in Denmark, where it has provided V2G services for more than five years with daily bidding on energy markets. Specifically, this operation aggregates a coalition of EV batteries to provide a primary frequency containment reserve (“FCR”) service to the local transmission system operator. The frequency of the current transmitted on an electrical grid is affected by the demand placed on the grid. By acting as a reserve to store or release energy into the grid in order to offset variations in demand, the FCR service provided by Nuvve’s GIVe platform assists the local system operator in the critical task of frequency regulation. 
Over the five-plus years of this deployment, Nuvve accumulated many hours of valuable learning on fleet operation and energy market behavior. This Denmark-based fleet is driven primarily during the day and is parked at night and on weekends, allowing it on average about 17 hours of available market participation per day. While FCR values in Denmark fluctuate year over year, Nuvve has been able to generate approximately US$2,000 per car per year in market revenue on average.
The V2G services revenue gives Nuvve’s customers a lower total cost of EVs ownership through benefits such as reduced charger costs, low or free energy costs to drive, fleet management tools, and yearly maintenance. This Denmark deployment showcases Nuvve’s ability to adapt its V2G software to match requirements for market participation and interconnection to the grid — vehicles in this commercial V2G operation are each connected to 10kW bidirectional DC chargers that are controlled by Nuvve’s V2G GIVe platform. As each vehicle is plugged in, Nuvve’s software automatically takes control of each vehicle’s charging and discharging. Nuvve aggregates multiple EVs into a VPP. The total available capacity from a coalition of aggregated EVs is bid onto the frequency-controlled reserve market. It is the design of Nuvve’s V2G platform that enables it to aggregate EVs into a VPP to provide services to the grid bidirectionally. This design incorporates (1) aggregation capabilities for available vehicles, charging stations and stationary batteries; (2) the ability to receive signals from and thereby know the needs of the grid at generation, transmission, distribution and behind-the-meter regions; and (3) real-time optimization that 
matches available coalition capacity onto grid needs on a second-by-second basis, all while ensuring the desired EV battery charge level at drive time.
Electric vehicles are inherently unreliable grid resources because their primary transportation function can cause them to be plugged in or unplugged at any time with varying states of charge. Nuvve’s platform transforms these unreliable resources into reliable, dispatchable and monetizable assets; this helps stabilize the grid, enables increased renewables penetration, reduces the total cost of EV ownership and encourages EV adoption. From the user perspective, the V2G operation is seamless as Nuvve’s V2G platform reduces the cost of ownership and ensures EVs are sufficiently charged to meet their primary transportation functions. Vehicle operators can use Nuvve’s fleet management app and set driving needs for any given day to fulfill their driving duties.
Market Opportunity and the Nuvve Solution
The EV industry has grown rapidly since Nuvve was founded in 2010. According to the Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) Vehicle-to-Grid: Big Opportunities, Big Challenges (March 2021), by 2040, there will be 500 million EVs on the road by 2040. In addition, countries around the world are expected to become increasingly focused on meeting climate goals, in part, by reducing the environmental effects of internal combustion engine vehicles, which account for approximately 45% of global CO2 emissions (source: ourworldindata.org). 
As EV adoption grows, the associated charging infrastructure needed to support EVs has also seen a growth trend over the last few years. According to an April 2021 report from Schroders, the number of public charging points has grown from just over 600,000 at the end of 2018 to reach over 1.3 million by the end of 2020. The same report projects the annual run-rate of investment in charging points will be $80 billion over the next 20 years.
Additional factors propelling this shift to electrification include proposed fossil fuel bans or restrictions, transit electrification mandates, utility incentive programs and declining battery costs. 
However, as EV adoption grows, demand for electricity as a transportation fuel may lead to congestion and overloading on transmission and local distribution grids. A significant investment is predicted to be needed to upgrade the electric grid to support this influx.
Simultaneously, higher penetration of renewable energy sources (such as solar and wind generation) inherently increases grid volatility. Nuvve believes that this combination of factors further drives the need for intelligent VGI and V2G capabilities to effectively regulate grid voltage and frequency on a real time basis and address other common challenges such as massive morning and afternoon grid ramping.
With V2G services capturing available grid value streams such as frequency regulation, adaptive power, smart charging, smart charging/discharging, and peak-shaving services as part of the solution, the EV fleet owner/operator can symbiotically assist in improving and assuring grid stabilization while earning revenues. These revenues can be shared with the ratepayer to save in transportation energy costs and thereby effectively lower the cost of EV ownership. V2G services can also help mitigate intermittency issues associated with renewables by (1) continuously injecting or absorbing energy to and from the grid every few seconds to help to regulate frequency; and (2) be orderly and intelligently dispatched over a larger time period to mitigate the enormous needs for capacity ramping. Perhaps most importantly, EVs represent one of the most appropriate solutions to act as dispatchable distributed energy resources during renewable-rich mid-day periods by absorbing excess energy which might otherwise be curtailed or create transmission network congestion problems.
Nuvve understands that the widespread adoption of electric mobility and renewable generation resources like solar and wind will require that EVs be utilized as bidirectional distributed energy resources to help stabilize the grid and be compensated for providing valuable grid services. Further, Nuvve believes that commercial fleet EVs represent the best initial addressable market for V2G because for commercial fleets, the shift from internal combustion vehicles to EV can bring numerous advantages:
1.Lower “fuel” costs and more sustainable, efficient and convenient infrastructure.
2.Lower maintenance costs for EVs compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.
3.Reduced maintenance downtime for EVs compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.
4.EV charging does not present all of the same environmental risks of liquid refueling, as it does not involve the storage and release of hydrocarbons at the refueling site.
5.The specific use cases for EVs by fleet operators, which often involve multiple shorter trips, can alleviate the range anxiety that has been a limiting factor in EV adoption to date.
Additionally, Nuvve believes that commercial fleet EVs are the best initial target market for V2G because the additional revenue potential would offset the higher up-front cost of EVs and further lower the total cost of ownership compared to traditional gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles.
Nuvve also believes that significant value can be derived from aggregating EVs into a VPP to provide grid services that can be monetized in the energy and power capacity markets. Nuvve’s GIVe software platform was created to harness capacity from “loads” at the edge of the distribution grid (i.e., coalitions of aggregated EVs and small stationary batteries) in a qualified, controlled and secure manner to provide many of the grid services offered by conventional generation sources (i.e., coal and natural gas plants). Nuvve’s current addressable energy and capacity markets for targeted grid services (frequency regulation, demand charge management, demand response, energy optimization, distribution grid services and energy arbitrage) are estimated to be of considerable value — each ranging from $3 billion to $250 billion per year.
Since 2010, Nuvve has been optimizing its energy software as a service (SaaS) model into a product that is adaptable (evolving with energy markets worldwide), adjustable (micro-service based to enable quick iteration) and scalable (compatible with widely adopted standards for EVs and charging stations). The result is a flexible, recurring revenue model where fleet customers can share in the value generated from their vehicles by Nuvve’s GIVe software platform. Today, Nuvve continues to advance its software platform’s ability to conduct forecasting, bidding, dispatching and reporting functionalities — so that the needs of the driver, the grid and the EV battery are continually met.
Nuvve’s Strategy
Nuvve’s strategy incorporates a diversified set of segments, geographies and partners, including light duty fleets, heavy duty fleets, automotive OEMs, charge point operators, and strategic partnerships located in Europe, Asia (including Japan) and North America.
•Light duty fleet customers are typically organizations that operate vehicle fleets for delivery and logistics, as shared transit for sales, service and other functions requiring a motorpool and for ridesharing services. Nuvve believes these customers choose to electrify their fleets for economic reasons, as the comparative total cost of ownership favors electrification. Nuvve’s GIVe software platform can help them lower operating costs and achieve sustainability goals. Nuvve offers networked charging stations, infrastructure, software, professional services, support, monitoring and parts and labor warranties required to run electric vehicle fleets, as well as low or free energy costs. The light duty fleet segment is accessed via direct sales force and world-wide channel partners.
•Heavy duty fleet customers are typically organizations that operate vehicle fleets in the school bus, shuttle bus, delivery truck, refuse truck, and transit bus segments. Nuvve believes these customers choose to electrify their fleets for economic reasons, as the comparative total cost of ownership favors electrification. Nuvve’s GIVe software platform can help them lower operating costs and achieve sustainability goals. Nuvve offers networked charging stations, infrastructure, software, professional services, support, monitoring and parts and labor warranties required to run electric vehicle fleets, as well as low or free energy costs. The heavy duty fleet segment is accessed via direct sales force and world-wide channel partners.
•Automotive OEM customers are typically organizations that develop and manufacture electric vehicles targeted for sale to their customers. Nuvve believes automotive OEM customers recognize that Nuvve’s GIVe software platform can help their customers lower operating costs and achieve sustainability goals, thereby helping to increase electric vehicle sales. Nuvve integrates its technology into the automotive OEM’s EV platforms in order make their vehicles compatible with the GIVe software platform. The automotive OEM segment is accessed via world-wide channel partners.
•Charge point operator customers are typically organizations that own, operate and provide EV charging equipment and networked EV charging services. Nuvve believes charge point operator customers recognize that Nuvve’s GIVe software platform can help their customers lower operating costs and achieve sustainability goals, thereby helping to increase the relative attractiveness of their charging network within this highly competitive segment. Nuvve integrates its technology into charge point operator platforms in order to make their charging station network compatible with the GIVe software platform. The charge point operator segment is accessed via world-wide channel partners.
•Strategic partnerships are typically joint ventures formed with strategic partners to help commercialize Nuvve’s technology and services within a given territory. Nuvve believes strategic partnerships are an important way to accelerate the adoption of its GIVe software platform world-wide. One such strategic partnership is Dreev, a business venture formed in 2019 between Nuvve (who provided its technology and know-how) and its strategic partner EDF (who provided capital and a subsidiary partner ecosystem) to address the territory within France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy and Germany. Nuvve agreed to assign to Dreev its rights to the V2G technology in these territories. Nuvve presently holds a 13% interest in Dreev. The parties have certain put and call option rights under the agreements for the business venture, including a call option for each party upon a change in control of the other party. While Nuvve anticipates that it will maintain or increase its stake in the business venture, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so.
Nuvve currently views the North American school bus segment to be one of its highest priorities world-wide. Nuvve anticipates the electrification of school buses to experience significant growth in the next 2 to 5 years, as there are over 600,000 school buses on the road today in the US and Canada. Approximately 95% of them are diesel with an average age of over 11 years. Leading school bus OEMs are thereby ramping up their electric bus production capacity in response to an increasing interest from school districts and fleet operators across the US and Canada. The electric school bus segment thereby represents a key growth opportunity for Nuvve to sell V2G capable charging stations and establish long-term recurring revenue streams from grid services. Following announcements during 2020 with leading OEMs in the North American electric school bus segment, 
Nuvve has formed Levo Mobility LLC ("Levo"), a Delaware limited liability company with Stonepeak Rocket Holdings LP ("Stonepeak"), a Delaware limited partnership and Evolve Transition Infrastructure LP ("Evolve"), a Delaware limited 
partnership to further develop its offerings to bring turnkey V2G solutions with finance packages to customers, including equipment financing, V2G services, infrastructure and maintenance operations. Levo is a consolidated entity of Nuvve.
Levo is a sustainable infrastructure company focused on rapidly advancing the electrification of transportation by funding V2G-enabled EV fleet deployments. Levo utilizes Nuvve’s V2G technology and committed capital from Stonepeak and Evolve to offer Fleet-as-a-Service for school buses, last-mile delivery, ride hailing and ride sharing, municipal services, and more to eliminate the primary barriers to EV fleet adoption including large upfront capital investments and lack of expertise in securing and managing EVs and associated charging infrastructure.
Levo's turnkey solution simplifies and streamlines electrification, can lower the total cost of EV operation for fleet owners, and support the grid when the EVs are not in use. For a fixed monthly payment with no upfront cost, Levo will provide the EVs, such as electric school buses, charging infrastructure powered by Nuvve’s V2G platform, EV and charging station maintenance, energy management, and technical advice.
Levo will initially focus on electrifying school buses, providing associated charging infrastructure, and delivering V2G services to enable safer and healthier transportation for children while supporting carbon dioxide emission reduction, renewable energy integration, and improved grid resiliency.
Nuvve also operates a small number of company-owned charging stations serving as demonstration projects funded by government grants. In previous years, a substantial portion of Nuvve’s revenues have been derived from these grant funded projects and Nuvve expects growth in company-owned stations and the related government grant funding to continue, Nuvve anticipates that such projects will constitute a declining percentage of its business as its commercial operations expand.
Nuvve expects to generate revenue primarily from the provision of services to the grid via its GIVe software platform and sales of V2G-enabled charging stations. In the case of light duty fleet and heavy duty fleet customers, Nuvve also may receive a mobility fee, which is a recurring fixed payment made by fleet customers per fleet vehicle. In addition, Nuvve may generate non-recurring engineering services revenue derived from the integration of its technology with automotive OEMs and charge point operators. In the case of recurring grid services revenue generated via automotive OEM and charge point operator customer integrations, Nuvve may share the recurring grid services revenue with the customer. Presently, grid services revenue comprises a small portion ov Nuvve's revenue, but Nuvve expects this portion to grow.
By employing a capital-light business model, Nuvve is able to strategically allocate its capital into research and development, marketing and sales and public policy. Nuvve continues to invest in expanding its GIVe software platform and V2G service 
capabilities and in the other areas described below, as well as in the service and maintenance of its company-owned stations and those stations with service and maintenance plans.
•The development and advancement of Nuvve’s GIVe software platform’s capabilities is critical to fulfilling Nuvve’s product vision for a platform that is adaptable, adjustable and scalable.
•Nuvve believes it is important to continue developing its global sales channels and grow its direct sales capabilities in order to support customer acquisition. This includes expanding its network of global partners who sell, install and maintain Nuvve’s solutions. Nuvve has and will continue to focus on category awareness and consistent branding.
•Nuvve continues to invest in its long-running efforts in policy and utility relationships. Nuvve advocates for policies that advance electric mobility and ensure a healthy industry with a focus on reduction in the barriers to bi-directional/V2G-capable infrastructure deployment, including interconnection processes and advocating for EVs and charging stations to be considered as distributed energy resources able to participate in wholesale energy markets.
Today, Nuvve believes it is the “first-mover” in the V2G space with clear competitive advantages, as described in “Competition” below.
Nuvve expects significant market opportunities for its V2G solutions as fleet EVs begin to arrive in more meaningful volume in coming years. Nuvve believes that its patent portfolio and significant experience in successfully deploying V2G technology and services presents a significant advantage.
Nuvve’s growth strategies for scaling its V2G technology and services are as follows:
•Accelerate new services and product offerings. Nuvve intends to maintain its first-mover advantage via continued efficient investment in engineering and product development.
•Invest in marketing and sales. Nuvve intends to continue attracting new customers and pursue a “portfolio effect” model which enables both V2G and uni-directional (V1G) assets to be efficiently combined in order to boost overall value.
•Pursue strategic acquisitions. Nuvve will explore potential high-quality acquisition opportunities.
Government Regulation and Incentives
State, regional and local regulations for installation of EV charging stations and the provision of grid services vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors and certifications, as examples. Compliance with such regulations may cause installation delays.
Public Utility Commissions
To operate Nuvve’s systems, Nuvve or its customer obtains interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on local law requirements, permission is provided by the local utility directly to Nuvve and/or its customers. In some cases, permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over metering policies. However, in other cases, regulatory approvals from the local public utility commission or other regulatory body are required.
NEMA
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (“NEMA”) is the association of electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers. NEMA provides a forum for the development of technical standards that are in the best interests of the industry and users, advocacy of industry policies on legislative and regulatory matters, and collection, analysis, and dissemination of industry data. All charging station products used or sold by Nuvve comply with the NEMA standards that are applicable to such products.
Waste Handling and Disposal
Nuvve is subject to laws and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes, including electronic wastes and batteries. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, in the United States and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred as well as companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environmental and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. Nuvve may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
Nuvve may also generate solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain components of products used or sold by Nuvve are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations, provided certain requirements are met. However, if these components do not meet all of the established requirements for the exclusion, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, Nuvve may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste, which are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations, or Nuvve’s ability to qualify the materials it uses for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect Nuvve’s operating expenses.
Similar laws exist in other jurisdictions where Nuvve operates. Additionally, in the European Union (“EU”), Nuvve is subject to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive. The WEEE Directive provides for the creation of collection scheme where consumers return WEEE to merchants, such as Nuvve. If Nuvve fails to properly manage such WEEE, it may be subject to fines, sanctions, or other actions that may adversely affect Nuvve’s financial operations.
OSHA
Nuvve is subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (“OSHA”). OSHA establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various record 
keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to Nuvve’s operations. Nuvve complies with OSHA regulations.
CAFE Standards
The regulations mandated by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards set the average new vehicle fuel economy, as weighted by sales, that a manufacturer’s fleet must achieve. Although Nuvve is not a car manufacturer and is thus not directly subject to the CAFE standards, Nuvve believes such standards may have a material effect on its business. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 raised the fuel economy standards of America’s cars, light trucks, and sport utility vehicles to a combined average of at least 35 miles per gallon (“mpg”) by 2020 — a 10 mpg increase over 2007 levels — and required standards to be met at maximum feasible levels through 2030. Building on the success of the first phase of the National Program, the second phase of fuel economy and global warming pollution standards for light duty vehicles covers model years 2017 – 2025. These standards were finalized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) in August 2012. These standards would have required a reduction in average carbon dioxide emissions of new passenger cars and light trucks to 163 grams per mile (g/mi) in model year 2025. Manufacturers may choose to comply with these standards by manufacturing more EVs which would mean that more charging stations of the type Nuvve uses and sells will be needed.
However, in April 2020, EPA and NHTSA finalized the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule (the “SAFE Rule”), which reformulated the required reductions, establishing average carbon dioxide emissions of new passenger cars and light trucks of 240 g/mi in model year 2026. Several states and groups have announced intentions to sue the United States government over this reformulation, so the final CAFE standards cannot currently be predicted with any certainty. However, to the extent fuel-efficiency standards are decreased, this may result in less demand for EVs and, in turn, less demand for Nuvve’s V2G technology and services.
Research and Development
Nuvve has invested a significant amount of time and expense into research and development of its GIVe software platform and V2G technology and services. Nuvve’s ability to maintain its leadership position depends in part on its ongoing research and development activities. Nuvve’s engineering team is responsible for the design, development, manufacturing and testing of its V2G technology and services. Nuvve focuses its efforts on developing its V2G technology and services to expand the capabilities of Nuvve’s software platform and V2G services.
Nuvve’s research and development is principally conducted at its headquarters in San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2021, Nuvve had 17 full-time employees and 3 contract workers engaged in its research and development activities.
Intellectual Property
Nuvve relies on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect its proprietary rights. Nuvve’s success depends in part upon its ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for Nuvve’s products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing Nuvve’s proprietary rights.
As of December 31, 2021, Nuvve had four United States patents issued, two United States pending non-provisional patent applications and no United States pending provisional patent applications. Additionally, Nuvve had nine issued foreign patents (in Europe, India, Japan, China and Korea) and three foreign patent applications currently pending in various foreign jurisdictions. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, there was one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application. These patents relate to various bi-directional (V2G) and uni-directional (V1G) EV charging functionalities, aggregation and grid services.
Nuvve owns these patents, including the four issued United States patents, which were acquired from the University of Delaware pursuant to an IP acquisition agreement, dated November 7, 2017. Under the agreement, Nuvve agreed to make certain milestone payments to the University of Delaware in the aggregate amount of up to $7,500,000 based on the achievement of certain substantial commercialization targets. The IP acquisition agreement terminates upon the later of the date all the milestone payments described above are made and the expiration date of the patents transferred to Nuvve. If the University of Delaware terminates the agreement upon a material breach by Nuvve of certain limited provisions of the IP assignment agreement (which do not include the milestone payment provisions) that is not cured within 45 days after notice from the university, Nuvve will be required to assign the patents back to the university. The patents acquired from the University of Delaware, which cover the technology underlying Nuvve’s GIVe platform, as well as its implementation inside the charging stations and the EVs, are a key part of Nuvve’s patent portfolio and are critical to the operation of its business and its competitive position.
The following is an abstract of each of the four issued United States Patents:

Patent | Primary Claims 
US No. 8,116,915 | A method and apparatus for managing system energy flow. The apparatus includes an energy storage unit to store energy to be used by a system and a power conversion unit configured to be coupled between the energy storage unit and a utility grid. The apparatus also includes a controller to selectively control the power conversion unit to transfer energy between the utility grid and the energy storage unit based at least in part on an anticipated use of the system. 
US No. 8,509,976 | Methods, systems, and apparatus for interfacing an electric vehicle with an electric power grid. An exemplary apparatus may include a station communication port for interfacing with electric vehicle station equipment (“EVSE”), a vehicle communication port for interfacing with a vehicle management system (“VMS”), and a processor coupled to the station communication port and the vehicle communication port to establish communication with the EVSE via the station communication port, receive EVSE attributes from the EVSE, and issue commands to the VMS to manage power flow between the electric vehicle and the EVSE based on the EVSE attributes. An electric vehicle may interface with the grid by establishing communication with the EVSE, receiving the EVSE attributes, and managing power flow between the EVE and the grid based on the EVSE attributes.


US No. 9,043,038 | Methods, systems, and apparatus for aggregating electric power flow between an electric grid and electric vehicles. An apparatus for aggregating power flow may include a memory and a processor coupled to the memory to receive electric vehicle equipment (“EVE”) attributes from a plurality of EVEs, aggregate EVE attributes, predict total available capacity based on the EVE attributes, and dispatch at least a portion of the total available capacity to the grid. Power flow may be aggregated by receiving EVE operational parameters from each EVE, aggregating the received EVE operational parameters, predicting total available capacity based on the aggregated EVE operational parameters, and dispatching at least a portion of the total available capacity to the grid.
US No. 9,754,300 | Methods, systems, and apparatus transferring power between the grid and an electric vehicle. The apparatus may include at least one vehicle communication port for interfacing with EVE and a processor coupled to the at least one vehicle communication port to establish communication with the EVE, receive EVE attributes from the EVE, and transmit EVSE attributes to the EVE. Power may be transferred between the grid and the electric vehicle by maintaining EVSE attributes, establishing communication with the EVE, and transmitting the EVSE maintained attributes to the EVE. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. The average remaining life of our patents was approximately 10.9 years as of December 31, 2021. 
Nuvve intends to continue to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of its technology, designs and methodologies that Nuvve believes provide a meaningful competitive advantage. However, because patent filings can be time-consuming and expensive, Nuvve’s ability to do so may be limited until such time as it is able to generate cash flow from operations or otherwise raise sufficient capital to continue to invest in Nuvve’s intellectual property. For example, maintaining patents in the United States and other countries requires the payment of maintenance fees which, if Nuvve is unable to pay, may result in loss of its patent rights. If Nuvve is unable to do so, its ability to protect its intellectual property or prevent others from infringing its proprietary rights may be impaired.
Sales
Nuvve currently maintains an in-house field sales force that maintains business relationships with customers and develops new sales opportunities through lead generation and marketing. Nuvve can also sell EV charging hardware and V2G software services through reseller partners, which then sell these products and services to their customers.
Marketing is performed by our in-house staff. To promote and sell our services to customers, we also utilize marketing and communication channels including press releases, email marketing, website (www.nuvve.com), and social media. The information on our websites is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this prospectus or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.
Nuvve anticipates continuing to expand revenues by selling EV charging equipment to current as well as new customers, which include school bus operators, school districts, universities, stadiums, infrastructure investors via special purpose vehicles, municipal locations, and other fleet operators. In addition to transportation hubs and workplace locations, Nuvve anticipates expanding sales channels to wholesale distributors, utilities, and automotive OEMs.
Nuvve’s revenues have and will be primarily derived from the sale of V2G-capable charging stations and recurring revenues from grid services provided by the GIVe software platform, as more fully described in “Nuvve’s Strategy” above. Historically, a significant portion of its revenue has been derived from government grant funded projects to demonstrate Nuvve’s V2G technology and services.
Customers
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Nuvve had customers whose revenue individually represented 10% or more of its total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, one customer accounted for 12.4%, and four customers in aggregate accounted for 62.3% of Nuvve's total revenue, respectively. 
During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Nuvve's top five customers accounted for approximately 44.0% and 70.8%, respectively, of its total revenue. 
Nuvve’s customer concentration has historically varied based on the receipt of large orders, a trend that Nuvve expects to continue in the near term.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Nuvve does not manufacture electric vehicle charging stations. The company integrates its technology into V2G-capable charging stations made by dedicated manufacturing partners located throughout the world. However, Nuvve's principal supplier of bidirectional DC Chargers is Rhombus Energy Solutions, and identifying a suitable alternative supplier could be an extensive process.
Nuvve has not experienced any direct disruptions in its supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, certain of its charging station manufacturing partners experienced longer lead times in the acquisition of critical components, leading to delays in completing certain integration projects. 
Competition
Nuvve provides a globally-available, commercial V2G technology platform that enables EV batteries to store and resell unused energy back to the local electric grid. While Nuvve believes its GIVe platform is the most advanced V2G platform on the market, as Management believes that it is the only one qualified by multiple grid system operators around the world to provide grid services, it operates within the highly competitive EV charging equipment and service market. Nuvve primarily competes with less advanced charge point operator EV charge management platforms providing fleet charging services without bi-directional capabilities, such as ChargePoint, Mobility House, EnelX, Shell-NewMotion, Blink and Ovo Energy. There are also additional entrants into the connected EV charging station equipment market, such as General Electric, SemaCharge, EVConnect, Fermata, and Greenlots. Nuvve expects this market to become increasingly competitive as new entrants enter the growing market. Nuvve’s products and services compete on the basis of product capability (such as V2G capability), performance and features, total cost of ownership, sales capabilities, financial stability, brand recognition, product reliability and size of installed base.
Nuvve’s V2G platform and the revenue it generates allows Nuvve to provide its customers with a lower total cost of EV ownership through benefits such as reduced charger costs, low or free energy costs to drive, fleet management tools, and yearly maintenance. Nuvve believe its competitors have historically struggled with gaining the technology and know-how necessary to 
establish a functional V2G software platform capable of aggregating EVs into a VPP and providing services to the grid bidirectionally, although they could build this capability in the future. While Tesla does offer EV charging services, these do not include V2G and Nuvve does not believe Tesla vehicles are capable of bi-directional power flow. There are many other large and small EV charger companies that offer non-networked or “basic” chargers that have limited customer leverage, but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and home locations. Because its competitors’ platforms are less advanced in providing V2G services, Nuvve believes it faces limited direct competition.
Nuvve believes it has competitive advantages over its competitors, such as its intellectual property portfolio (Nuvve owns key patents for V2G); qualification by transmission system operators (Nuvve is already qualified by multiple operators, making it easier for it to expand into other areas); experience (over a decade of experience of market participation and stakeholder interaction); and data ownership (Nuvve has accumulated vast amounts of data, which is the key for rapid and future developments). However, many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources than Nuvve does. We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors, either because they have greater resources or name recognition than we do, because their products and services are superior or more cost efficient than ours, or because they make technical advances to which we are unable to respond.

Corporate History
Nuvve is a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 2488 Historic Decatur Rd., Suite 200, San Diego, California, and our telephone number is (619) 456-5161.
We were formed on November 10, 2020 under the name “NB Merger Corp.” as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newborn Acquisition Corp. (“Newborn”) for the purpose of effecting a business combination (the “Business Combination”) with Newborn and Nuvve Corporation (“Nuvve Corp.”). On March 19, 2021, we consummated the Business Combination in accordance with the terms of that certain Merger Agreement, dated as of November 11, 2020 and amended as of February 20, 2021, between us, Newborn, Nuvve Corp., Nuvve Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (“Merger Sub”), and Ted Smith, an individual, as the representative of the stockholders of Nuvve Corp. (the “Merger Agreement”). Prior to the Business Combination, Newborn was a publicly traded special purpose acquisition corporation, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Newborn, and Nuvve Corp. was a private operating company. On the closing date of the Business Combination, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) Newborn reincorporated to Delaware through the merger of Newborn with and into our company, with our company surviving as the publicly traded entity (the “Reincorporation Merger”), and (ii) immediately after the Reincorporation Merger, we acquired Nuvve through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Nuvve Corp., with Nuvve Corp. surviving as the wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the “Acquisition Merger”). As a result, we became a publicly traded holding company with Nuvve Corp. as our operating subsidiary. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name to “Nuvve Holding Corp.”
Nuvve Corp. was incorporated in Delaware on October 15, 2010 under the name “Nuvve Corporation.” Nuvve was formed for the purpose of providing, directly and through business ventures with its partners, its V2G technology platform that enables EV batteries to store and resell unused energy back to the local electric grid and provide other grid services. Newborn was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on April 12, 2019 under the name “Newborn Acquisition Corp.” Newborn was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
