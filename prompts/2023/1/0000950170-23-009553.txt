 Item 1.  Business
 OVERVIEW
 FalconStor is the trusted data protection software leader modernizing disaster recovery and backup operations for the hybrid cloud world. The Company enables enterprise customers and managed service providers to secure, migrate, and protect their data while reducing data storage and long-term retention costs by up to 95%. More than 1,000 organizations and managed service providers worldwide standardize on FalconStor as the foundation for their cloud first data protection future. Our products are offered through and supported by a worldwide network of leading original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), managed service providers ("MSPs"), systems integrators, and resellers.
Our products address the increasing demand for hybrid-cloud data protection for multiple devices, networks and platforms across enterprise on-premises data centers, and private and public clouds. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic accelerated this shift, as ongoing remote work and work from home arrangements introduced novel challenges to maintaining enterprise data security. The adoption of increased employee mobility and flexible remote work arrangements, such as a broader incorporation of cloud technology and the option for employees to use their own devices, has introduced additional vulnerabilities that businesses must monitor and protect through solutions like ours in order to maintain enterprise data integrity.
Our products are utilized by enterprises and MSPs to address two key areas of enterprise data protection: (i) long-term data retention and recovery, and (ii) data replication to preserve business continuity. As enterprises increasingly look to focus their core IT staffs on application development and refresh, MSPs are increasingly assuming responsibility for cloud integration and data protection. Our integration with modern cloud-based data storage environments, such as IBM Cloud, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure, enables our enterprise customers to significantly reduce costs and improve the portability, security and accessibility of their enterprise data and enables MSPs to serve their customers with their cloud of choice. We believe this accessibility is key in our modern world, where data must be protected and intelligently leveraged to facilitate learning, improve product design and drive competitive advantage. Our products can be used regardless of the underlying hardware, cloud and source-data, which enables our enterprise customers to leverage their existing hardware and software investments.
 Since the beginning of 2020, we have focused our go to market efforts on long-term data retention and recovery data protection segment. In 2021, we increased our go-to-market investment within our core regions of the Americas, EMEA, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, and released StorSafeTM, the next generation of our Virtual Tape Library (“VTL”) product family built for MSPs. In 2022, we secured a key strategic relationship with IBM to optimize data protection for on-premises and cloud-native workloads that operate on the IBM Power Systems platform.
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND
 Enterprises of all sizes are increasingly challenged to securely archive, replicate and make available their data assets. This challenge is increased as business pressures to reduce cost and increase efficiency push enterprises to adopt cloud-based technologies, which are critical to handling the growth in data and strategic uses of enterprise data, despite an increasing amount of records and data that has been compromised over the past several years. For example, according to the 2021 Year End Report published by RiskBased Security, approximately 22 billion records of sensitive data were lost from various breaches, with a 10 percent increase in the number of publicly disclosed breaches that occurred in the United States as compared to 2020.

We believe long-term data archive is the fastest-growing segment of an enterprise’s data assets. This growth is accelerating as enterprises are increasingly subject to complex regulatory compliance, such as that driven by the Food and Drug Administration, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As the volume of long-term archive continues to expand, the need for enterprises to securely and cost-effectively store the associated data will only increase.
 The introduction of new long-term archive storage options has also given rise to a growth in MSPs remotely managing data protection, primarily to smaller enterprises with a less complex array of data assets. The MSPs are able to leverage modern broadband connectivity and offer more scalable long-term storage options, which will serve to reduce data protection costs for their customers. We believe this trend to outsourced long-term archive data protection will continue.
 New regulations and laws governing the processing, storage, retention, protection and reinstatement of high-value information assets are driving significant growth in the data protection markets. We believe that data archives will play an increasing role in training and validating artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms and optimizing strategic analytic model outcomes. Given our long history and deep skillset of the unique challenges associated with long-term storage, we believe that we are in position to capitalize on data assets that are subject to new protection requirements with our existing product portfolio. Our innovative StorSafe product is designed and architected to leverage the scale-up and scale-out capabilities found in today's public and private clouds to support the expanding long-term data protection market demand that is estimated to grow into the Zettabyte (10^21) range by 2030, according to market intelligence provider International Data Corporation. We believe our innovative integration of long-term archive storage into modern cloud-based technologies will enable our customers to dramatically improve the portability, security, and accessibility of their enterprise data.
 OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SUPPORTING TECHNOLOGY
 FalconStor’s software products create investment protection, flexibility, and leverage of modern cloud-based technologies, through software-defined functionality that provides backup and long-term retention, and business continuity driven data replication. As a result, our enterprise clients are able to utilize the underlying storage hardware, media, or environment (on-premise or cloud) that best aligns with their strategic needs. Our customers utilize our products to protect data residing in physical, virtual, private-cloud, public-cloud, and multi-cloud environments, giving them the freedom to optimize their data protection infrastructure and eliminate costly hardware-vendor, cloud, and form-factor lock-in.
Long-Term Data Retention and Recovery Products
 FalconStor Virtual Tape Library: We were an early innovator in Virtual Tape Library (“VTL”) technology, which allows enterprise customers to emulate and replace cumbersome physical tape libraries with archive related data preservation, without replacing their existing backup and archive software and associated processes. We believe our VTL product continues to be a leading virtual tape library solution in terms of performance and scalability. With VTL, our enterprise customers are able to complete their data archive operations more reliably, with minimal changes to their legacy archive environment. They are also able to leverage sophisticated physical tape emulation, advanced data security, data-deduplication, and public- or private-cloud based virtual tape archive storage. We have subjected our VTL solution to independent performance testing, which at the time demonstrated that our product was 25% faster than a competitor and could be executed on hardware that was one-third the cost of that required by our closest competitor. We enable our customers to reduce the amount of data that needs to be archived by processing their archive data through our integrated data deduplication engine. By eliminating redundant archive data, the archive storage capacity required can be significantly reduced. Our technology allows our enterprise customers to significantly reduce the cost of storing the ever-growing volume of data that is subject to long-term archive data protection mandates.
 FalconStor StorSafeTM (“StorSafe”) - Traditionally, enterprises have had limited choice and have been forced to store their archive data on physical tape or within storage arrays installed in an internal data center. Our newest and most innovative long-term archive data management software product, StorSafe, breaks these traditional storage limitations and enables enterprises to securely and cost effectively leverage a wide array of storage options, including ultra-efficient and scalable cloud-based storage environments, such as IBM Cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure.


Launched in 2020, StorSafe, like our proven VTL solution, provides sophisticated physical tape emulation and seamless integration with an enterprise’s legacy backup and archive software and processes. In addition, StorSafe includes our advanced data deduplication technology. However, StorSafe takes long-term archive storage optimization to an entirely new and innovative level by providing multi-tenant data management that is critical to MSP Backup-as-a-Service (“BaaS”) and Migration-as-a-Service (“MaaS”) offerings. Our StorSafe solution dramatically improves archive data portability, accessibility, security, and integrity validation, for both individual enterprise customers and MSPs providing BaaS and MaaS to dozens, if not hundreds, of individual enterprises customers. As a result, a full spectrum of archive data storage options is made available to our enterprise customers to efficiently utilize essentially any storage environment, while confidently ensuring data security and efficient archive access.
Business Continuity Driven Data Replication Products
 The FalconStor StorGuardTM (“StorGuard”) Suite includes the functionality of the following point solutions.
 FalconStor Continuous Data Protector (“CDP”): In addition to retaining long-term archive data, enterprises routinely maintain short-term copies, or backups, of data generated by various user applications to protect against data loss or natural disaster. Moving beyond once-a-day backup models, CDP combines local and remote protection into a cost-effective, unified, disk-based solution that allows enterprises to recover data back to the most recent transaction. Combining application-aware snapshot agents and continuous journaling functions, CDP enables customers to recover data effectively at any point in time. CDP delivers instant data availability and reliable recovery, with the capacity to bring business applications back online in a matter of minutes after a failure. CDP protects application-specific data for Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and other business applications, ensuring high performance and stability for complex business environments.
 FalconStor Network Storage Server (“NSS”): The expanding capacity of data managed by enterprises creates a continual challenge in ensuring adequate amounts of available storage. NSS is a scalable solution that enables data storage virtualization and business continuity in heterogeneous environments. Supporting existing third-party disk arrays, NSS eliminates storage boundaries and vendor lock-in, providing fast and secure data storage provisioning and migration. Our core storage virtualization technology provides a non-disruptive approach to data mobility across different storage area network protocols and vendors. With NSS, it becomes a simple operation to move data from older platforms to newer ones or to introduce new storage capacity and tiers. This allows enterprises to respond to evolving performance and capacity requirements, as well as changing data protection mandates. Our products are sold as stand-alone software, but can also be bundled with standard hardware configurations to simplify implementation for our customers.
 We are currently marketing our CDP and NSS products under the name StorGuard.
 Supporting Technology
 Our core long-term archive and business continuity driven products are complemented by a set of underlying technologies that streamline usability and overall solution performance.
 FalconStor StorSightTM (“StorSight”): StorSight gives our enterprise customers and MSPs the ability to administer long-term archive and business continuity driven data replication from one centralized management point and to easily test our other products they may not be currently licensing. To simplify our development efforts and to enable broader use of our products by our enterprise customers, we have unified all user management into our modern HTML-based console and rebranded that unified tool as StorSight. As a result, StorSight is now our unified data protection console used to administer our VTL, StorSafe, CDP, and NSS products. Our StorSight user console provides deep analytics relative to each of our products as they are utilized in production. StorSight also includes a full array of functionality key to our MSP customers, such as multi-tenancy and charge-back. StorSight usage licensing is included when customers and MSPs license any of our products.
 FalconStor RecoverTracTM (“RecoverTrac”) Disaster Recovery Technology: Our patented RecoverTrac technology streamlines the implementation, testing and execution of disaster recovery operations. It minimizes service failover time between sites and reduces disaster recovery costs by offering full recovery from physical-to-physical, virtual-to-virtual and physical-to-virtual server infrastructures. This technology is a disaster recovery automation service, and is included as a standard feature of our NSS and CDP products to automate complex, time-consuming and error-prone failover and failback operations of systems, applications, services and

entire data centers. This technology can also work across those environments, enabling organizations to seamlessly migrate locally, remotely or to and from cloud environments.
 FalconStor MicroScanTM (“MicroScan”) Technology: Our patented MicroScan technology minimizes the amount of data transferred during replication by eliminating inefficiencies at the application and file system layer. Data changes are replicated at the smallest possible level of granularity, reducing LAN/WAN bandwidth and associated storage costs for disaster recovery (“DR”), and any time data is replicated from one source to another. MicroScan is an integral part of our replication option for CDP and NSS.
 BUSINESS STRATEGY
 FalconStor’s products and supporting technologies serve enterprise IT organizations and MSPs worldwide and are guided by the following strategies.
Provide a Bridge to Cloud-Based Data Storage, While Protecting Investments
 As enterprise IT organizations look to modernize their long-term archive and business continuity related data replication, they are challenged by the cost, risk, and disruption upgrades and migrations can cause. Because FalconStor abstracts the data protection services from the physical storage infrastructure, additional capabilities can be added to legacy hardware, eliminating the need and cost to replace that hardware. This delivers discrete value in terms of lowering capital and operational costs, reduced risk and disruption, and significantly faster time to deployment. For IT organizations wishing to deploy new hardware or storage paradigms, including the utilization of private- or public-cloud based storage, such as IBM Cloud, AWS, or Azure, our products enable the migration and on-going optimization of data storage to and on those new platforms, versus being forced to start with a new or “greenfield” deployment required by many of the latest hardware vendors. FalconStor offers these organizations a path forward with an approach that minimizes or eliminates risk and disruption to business processes and workflows while lowering both capital and operational costs.
 We intend to continue leveraging the protocol-independent, unified architecture, analytics and open data services technology of our products to maintain a competitive position in the enterprise storage software market. With the addition of StorSafe, and its associated storage container technology, we have joined and are dedicated to the Open Source community, which has accelerated development and integration efforts across our entire product suite. We intend to continue delivering technical innovation that creates investment protection, flexibility and leverage of modern cloud-based technologies for our enterprise customers.
 Enable Managed Service Providers
 As the MSP segment continues to grow, MSPs increasingly have a need to support heterogeneous storage environments across their own data centers and their customers’ environments. MSPs often have different hardware and software capabilities, making it significantly challenging to offer consistent data services across these environments. We believe that we offer strategic benefits for MSPs by (i) enabling the seamless and non-disruptive movement of data from the customer premises to the service provider’s hosted environment, (ii) offering common data services across a customer’s environments regardless of underlying hardware or technology, (iii) allowing for the introduction and ability to monetize additional data services they may not have previously been able to offer, (iv) providing a low-cost growth opportunity due to the flexibility of StorSight licensing, while eliminating the need to have multiple feature licenses array by array, and (v) enabling reduced storage management complexity and costs within their infrastructure by eliminating silos, reducing licensing costs and optimizing hardware.
Expand Software and Hardware Strategic Alliances with Industry Leaders
 The Flash/SSD, High-Density Single Disk and Cloud Data Archival markets are key opportunities for us on two fronts: targeting customers wanting to integrate this new technology into existing IT environments, and OEMs needing to enhance their software stack in order to offer data movement and protection services on their platform. Cloud service providers (“CSPs”) such as IBM Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Azure, Wasabi and Alibaba Cloud also represent a growth opportunity. Our mutual customers and partners need help moving data from the customer site to their own facilities, as well as a way to deliver common data services across disparate and often incompatible hardware typically found across the provider and end customer environments. We believe that we are positioned to continue to take advantage of these key opportunities in the global marketplace.


Accelerate our Marketing and Distribution in our Best Suited Markets
 We plan to continue to focus our marketing and distribution efforts on enterprise customers, MSPs, CSPs, resellers, systems integrators and OEM partners. We believe these markets and distribution channels offer a significant opportunity and are best suited to realize the value of our products, and provide an efficient and effective access to broad, worldwide markets.
 Growth Drivers
 A shift to Hybrid Cloud operating environments, new regulations and laws governing the processing, storage, retention, protection, and reinstatement of high-value information assets are driving double-digit growth in the data protection markets. Additionally, we believe that data archives will play an increasing role in training and validating AI and Machine Learning algorithms and optimizing strategic analytic model outcomes. Given FalconStor's long history and deep skillset of the unique challenges associated with long-term storage, we feel we are in an excellent position to capitalize on data assets that are subject to new protection requirements with our existing product portfolio. Our innovative StorSafe product is designed and architected to leverage the scale-up and scale-out capabilities found in today's public and private clouds to support the expanding long-term data protection market demand that is estimated to grow into the Zettabyte (10^21) range by 2030 (IDC). In addition, we believe our innovative integration of long-term archive storage into modern cloud-based technologies will enable our customers to dramatically improve the portability, security, and accessibility of their enterprise data. We believe, this accessibility will be key in our modern world, where data is not only protected, but also intelligently leveraged to facilitate learning, improve product design, and drive competitive advantage.
SALES ROUTES TO MARKET
 FalconStor continues to sell products through:
 •MSPs and CSPs
 •Authorized partners, value-added resellers (VARs), solution providers, and large system integrators 
 •Direct Market Resellers (DMRs) and Distributors
 •OEMs
 Professional Services
 FalconStor’s Professional Services personnel are also available to assist customers and partners throughout the lifecycle of FalconStor product deployments. The Professional Services team includes experienced Storage Architects (expert field engineers) who can assist in the assessment, planning/design, implementation, and test phases of the deployment project, and a Technical Support Group for post-deployment assistance and ongoing support.
MARKETING
 We focus our efforts to increase awareness and demand for FalconStor products by targeting our efforts at our extensive global installed base and the expanding awareness in the emerging long-term data protection market.
PRODUCT LICENSING
 Historically, the majority of our software licenses have been sold on a per terabyte capacity basis and have included a perpetual right to use the licensed capacity. However, over the last few years, we have shifted to a focus on capacity-based licenses on a subscription or term-based model, which gives a customer the right to utilize the licensed terabyte capacity over a designated period of time. We expect revenue from subscription-based licensing to increase over the next several years.
COMPETITION
 Long-Term Data Retention and Recovery
 We believe our StorSafe and VTL products are positioned well in the marketplace. Given the fact that these products are designed to integrate with an enterprise’s legacy backup and archive software and processes, the level of competition we believe we typically face is limited to DellEMC’s Data Domain virtual tape library product.
We also compete with legacy backup and archive vendors such as Veritas, and Commvault; however, in practice, we believe our products are more complimentary to their solutions than competitive, as our solutions do not require their solutions to be retired or replaced. In fact, our enterprise customers view the ability to maintain their legacy software solutions and processes as a key differentiator for selecting FalconStor products, as it is common for them to use backup and archive products from multiple vendors. By inserting our StorSafe or VTL product, customers are able to aggregate all of their archive data easily and control global data deduplication and archive storage from one central point.
 We believe our enterprise and MSP customers also view the fact that our StorSafe and VTL products operate effectively with Windows, Linux, IBM i and IBM AIX operating system (OS) environments as a key differentiator. As a result, we execute specific go-to-market efforts to identify enterprise and MSP customers that have multiple OS environments in production.
 Beyond the differentiation our StorSafe and VTL products provide related to existing infrastructure integration, we also believe the innovations we are delivering to improve backup and long-term retention and will serve as important competitive differentiators for FalconStor over the next several years. This belief is founded on the fact that our new innovations are designed to significantly improve archive data portability, security, and integrity validation. In addition, our new innovations are designed to allow our enterprise customers to seamlessly leverage multiple private- or public-clouds at one time to significantly reduce archive data storage costs.
 Business Continuity Driven Data Replication
 Competition within the business continuity driven data replication space is significant and includes products from Veeam, Rubrik, Cohesity, Commvault, Veritas, DellEMC, DataCore, and others. As a result, it is imperative that we carefully select the areas in which we will compete to ensure they are aligned with our key product differentiations. Accordingly, our two areas of focus within this space are on-premise storage virtualization and granular application-aware data replication snapshots that enable our enterprise customers to recover data back to a specific point in time for near real-time recovery time objectives.
