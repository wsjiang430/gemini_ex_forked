Item 1. Business
Overview
Amprius has developed and, since 2018, been in commercial production of an ultra-high energy density lithium-ion battery for mobility applications leveraging disruptive silicon anodes. Our silicon anode technology enables batteries with higher energy density, higher power density, and extreme fast charging capabilities over a wide range of operating temperatures, which results in our batteries providing superior performance compared to conventional graphite lithium-ion batteries. Our silicon anodes are a direct drop-in replacement of the graphite anode in traditional lithium-ion batteries, and our manufacturing process leverages the manufacturing process for conventional lithium-ion batteries and the related supply chain.
Today, our batteries are primarily used for existing and emerging aviation applications, including unmanned aerial systems (“UAS”), such as drones and high-altitude pseudo satellites (“HAPS”). We believe our proprietary technology has the potential for broad application in electric transportation.
Our batteries and their performance specifications have been tested and validated for application by over 40 customers, including Airbus, AeroVironment, BAE Systems, the U.S. Army and Teledyne FLIR, and we have shipped over 10,000 batteries to date, which have enabled mission critical applications. Our proprietary silicon anode structures, battery cell designs and manufacturing processes are defended by our portfolio of patents, trade secrets and know-how developed over 10 years of research and development.
We currently manufacture batteries on a kWh-scale manufacturing line at our headquarters in Fremont, California, where we believe demand for our batteries exceeds our manufacturing capacity. We are working to meet the expected demand in several rapidly growing addressable markets, including by designing and building a large-scale manufacturing facility that can produce batteries at GWh+ scale.

Corporate Background and Liquidity
On September 14, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), Amprius completed a business combination pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, dated May 11, 2022 (the “Business Combination Agreement”), by and among Amprius, Kensington Capital Merger Sub Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Amprius (“Merger Sub”), and Amprius Technologies Operating, Inc. (formerly known as Amprius Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated in March 2015) (“Legacy Amprius”). Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Amprius changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (the “Domestication”), upon which Amprius changed its name to “Amprius Technologies, Inc.,” and a business combination between Amprius and Legacy Amprius was effected through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Legacy Amprius, with Legacy Amprius surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Amprius (together with the Domestication and the other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, the “Business Combination”).
Unless the context otherwise provides, "Amprius", the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer (i) prior to the Closing Date, to Legacy Amprius and (ii) after the Closing Date, to Amprius Technologies, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Legacy Amprius. Prior to the Business Combination, Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp. IV is referred to herein as “Kensington.” 
Prior to the Business Combination, we financed our operations primarily through capital contributions from Amprius, Inc. ("Amprius Holdings"), our former parent company and current majority stockholder, and revenue generated from operations. We expect to rely on cash on hand, which was $69.7 million as of December 31, 2022, as well as any

proceeds from the Committed Equity Financing (as defined below) and government grants to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months. However, to the extent that our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Further, the likelihood that our warrant holders will exercise warrants and any cash proceeds that we would receive is dependent upon the market price of our common stock. To the extent we are unable to raise additional capital and we are unable to install the larger scale manufacturing process, discussed below, our ability to grow will be adversely affected. For more information, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Technology, Products and Manufacturing" and "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below.
Industry Background
Traditional transportation has been powered by fossil fuel-based engines which have led to significant greenhouse gas emissions. A rising focus on sustainable energy use in transportation is leading to increased investments in technology, government incentives and consumer demand for the electrification of passenger and payload mobility. Among the mobility mediums experiencing a shift to electrification due to these trends are aircraft such as UAS, which includes drones and HAPS, and electric vertical take-off and landing ("eVTOL") planes, as well as ground-based electric vehicles ("EVs"). Critical and breakthrough battery technologies can facilitate and, in certain cases, enable the mass adoption of these electric transportation mediums by improving energy density, accelerating fast charging capabilities, extending battery life, and improving safety.
Aviation Industry
Unmanned Aerial Systems: UAS are aircraft that operate with no crew or passengers onboard and are guided by remote control or autonomously. Examples of UAS include drones and HAPS. UAS are the next generation aerial transportation technology utilized for surveillance, assessment, logistics, delivery, communications, and imaging, among other uses. Emerging technologies, such as Amprius’ silicon anode battery, offer lighter weight and/or more energy dense batteries, potentially overcoming current battery technology barriers and enabling faster adoption of UAS. Based on an Insider Intelligence article from April 2022, a Stratistics report from March 2022 and management estimates, the total addressable market for UAS batteries is expected to reach approximately $38.2 billion by 2025.
Drones: Drones are the most common type of UAS that are increasingly being utilized in various industries, including military and defense, agricultural, construction and logistics. One of the key barriers to wider adoption is the existing battery technology, which limits the flight range and payload capacity. Our batteries offer higher energy density, which enables longer range endurance, and, depending on customer specifications, lighter weight, which facilitates higher payload capacity.
High Altitude Pseudo Satellites: HAPS are alternatives for traditional satellites. When deployed, HAPS typically operate at stratospheric altitudes, approximately 12 miles (approximately 65,000 feet) above sea level. HAPS are being increasingly utilized to provide high-quality broadcast features, particularly in remote regions, which have limited terrestrial network coverage. HAPS generally use solar energy and battery storage as the power source to operate for long durations of time. As a result, lightweight, higher energy density batteries with the ability to operate in extreme temperature and pressure conditions are critical enablers. Amprius offers advanced battery technology suitable for application in HAPS, which is currently in use by prominent aerospace companies, like Airbus.
Electric Air Transportation: Population growth and urbanization are key megatrends that are stretching ground transportation infrastructure to its limits and resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. A potential mitigation strategy is expanding travel into the air, which is offered by eVTOL vehicles, a passenger aircraft that uses electric power to hover, takeoff, and land vertically. Historically, the electrification of passenger and cargo aircraft has lagged the adoption of electric automobiles in part because of the greater technical challenges. However, over the last few years there have been significant advancements in the key enabling technologies for eVTOL aircraft, such as the high energy density and robust performance batteries offered by Amprius. Continued improvements in battery energy density could allow eVTOL aircraft to increase their range, speed and payload, dramatically expanding the range of trips and further accelerating the adoption of electric air mobility. Based on Morgan Stanley’s May 2021 report and management estimates, the total global addressable electric air mobility battery market is forecasted to reach approximately $11.1 billion by 2025.
EV Industry
The electrification of ground transportation is being accelerated by regulatory pressure to meet sustainability benchmarks and growing consumer preference. Some of the largest global automotive OEMs expect to be 100% EV by 
Index to Consolidated Financial Statements

2035. Market and Market’s February 2021 report estimates that the global electric vehicle battery market is expected to reach $67.2 billion by 2025. McKinsey & Company estimated in October 2021 that EV battery requirements will be 3,900 GWh in 2030, of which 2,400 GWh will be needed for passenger cars alone. While multiple battery chemistries exist today that meet current EV specifications, there is room for significant improvement. According to a recent Deloitte survey, two of the key consumer concerns with EV adoption are driving range and lack of charging infrastructure. Our batteries, which have been tested and validated by the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium (“USABC”), as further described below, have the potential to help address both these concerns. As such, while our EV capable battery needs to be improved with respect to cycle life, form factor, cost and production quantity for us to compete with existing commercially available EV batteries, we believe that, as we grow and improve, we may be able to compete in the EV battery market.
Battery Requirements for Electric Transportation
Current battery technology creates a barrier in the near-term for the electric transportation market, especially for electric air mobility applications, as battery weight, size and recharging times would need to be improved for these operations to become commercial. The battery system must fulfill several key requirements:
•high energy density and specific energy in order to achieve long range endurance while enabling lighter weight;
•high power density to provide sufficient power at a specific instance, such as during aircraft take-off or landing;
•fast charging capabilities to enable high infrastructure throughput;
•operational in wide temperature and pressure ranges;
•safe to operate in a wide variety of conditions;
•a long calendar life and cycle life; and
•acceptable cost, which varies by application.
Our Solution
Today’s batteries typically utilize graphite as the anode material. Based on management’s estimates, we believe that graphite anodes have reached their theoretical limits for energy storage. We estimate that graphite anodes can only provide up to 355 mAh/g capacity for lithium storage, which can further degrade in extreme environments. We believe additional increases in the energy density for lithium-ion batteries are possible only by using active anode materials that have a higher capacity for lithium storage. Among such active materials, silicon is known to have the highest lithium storage capacity per unit mass or volume over any other element besides lithium itself.
In our batteries, we have replaced the graphite anode with a highly engineered silicon material that has a lithium storage capacity of approximately 3,400 mAh/g—nearly 10 times the highest capacity of known graphite anodes. By replacing graphite with silicon in the anode, we have significantly enhanced performance in batteries across energy density, power, charging time, safety and ability to operate in extreme environments.

Our Competitive Strengths
Performance greatly exceeds conventional lithium-ion batteries commercially available today. The battery cells that we ship to our customers today significantly outperform commercially available conventional graphite battery cells. In particular, as shown in the table below, our batteries have approximately double the specific energy and energy density of graphite battery cells, and enable significantly faster charging time. We believe other next-generation battery technologies will require significant additional research, development and investment prior to being commercially viable.

Unique suitability for aviation markets that require high power, specific energy and energy density. We believe the increased performance of our batteries enable certain electric aviation applications. Specifically, our batteries have high specific energy and energy density, to maximize payload and reduce weight, thereby extending flight radius; high power density, to enable vertical take-off and landing functionality; fast charge, to minimize the time required to recharge a battery; wide operating temperature, for high altitude applications operating in extremely low temperatures; and cycle life parity with graphite batteries, depending on customer specifications. 
In March 2023, our new prototype battery cells were verified to deliver energy density >504 WH/kg and >1321 WH/L at 25°C. The performance was verified by a leading testing house offering comprehensive battery regulatory compliance, safety and performance testing. We believe our next-generation cells, when commercially available, will have the potential to expand boundaries for our customers and provide a tailored solution for applications that require heightened discharge times without compromising key features, such as aircraft payload, and without having to increase vehicle weight.
First mover advantage in emerging aviation markets. As a result of our success with Airbus and other tier-one customers, we have become an established market pioneer in providing high performance batteries to the aviation industry. Our reputation and commitment to delivering ultra-high performance batteries have enabled us to enter into several development and master supply arrangements with our customers. Over 40 of our customers have tested and confirmed that our batteries exceed the technical requirements for their applications, and we believe our market leadership in aviation will enable us to continue to grow our customer base.
Proven performance in demanding and abuse-tested environments. Safety is recognized as one of the most important factors of lithium-ion battery technology. Our silicon anodes operate at a voltage that is at least 100 mV higher than that of graphite anodes, which not only enables faster charging but also cell operation at lower temperatures, thereby improving cell safety and mitigating the risk of overcharging. Our batteries are also designed to be ultra-resilient and undergo rigorous abuse testing, including air cargo certification and specific tests for defense applications. 
In December 2022, an independent third-party testing lab validated our 390Wh/kg polymer electrolyte cell by successfully passing the nail penetration test per the requirements of section 4.7.4.4. of the MIL-PRF-32383 (Military Performance Specification). The test is used to determine the feasibility of a specific product in combat scenarios. Cells

tested in accordance with 4.7.4.4. shall not burn or explode, and the external temperature of each test sample shall not be greater than 338 degrees Fahrenheit (170 degrees Celsius) when penetrated by sharp objects. When conducting the test, a 0.113-inch diameter stainless steel nail is driven through a fully charged cell at a prescribed speed. The cell is deemed to have passed if there is no smoke or flame following the nail penetration. 
Robust IP portfolio and know-how related to our silicon nanowire ecosystem. Our silicon anode technology has been refined and improved upon for over 10 years, and is protected by over 80 issued patents and pending applications. Core aspects of our technologies and processes are also protected by know-how and trade secrets developed by our team for more than 10 years.
Our Products and Customers
As evidenced by customer validation, design wins and recurring orders with Airbus, AeroVironment, Teledyne FLIR, among others, our battery technology is well positioned to address the rapidly growing markets within the aviation industry, specifically UAS and eVTOL. UAS and eVTOL applications have historically used conventional lithium-ion batteries as a means to promote product prototypes, but market participants are seeking advancements in battery technology. We believe that our silicon anode technology can be part of the solution, as we currently offer three product platforms: High Energy, High Power, and Balanced Energy/Power.
High Energy Products. Our High Energy products are designed to maximize specific energy for applications that do not have high power requirements. For applications that have a continuous discharge rate of less than C/2, our High Energy battery cells deliver a specific energy of over 425 Wh/kg, and at C/10, up to 450 Wh/kg. This product has been most frequently used by HAPS, which are frequently designed to carry a payload at high altitudes for extended periods, typically for weeks or months at a time, as they rely on solar power for operations during the day and need to store sufficient energy in the battery to keep the aircraft aloft during the night.
For example, our battery is the energy storage technology aboard the Zephyr S, a HAPS by Airbus. The Zephyr S is a stratospheric vehicle that is designed to fly for months at a time, at an altitude of approximately 70,000 feet. In 2018, after integrating our battery cells into the Zephyr S, Airbus set an endurance and altitude record by flying continuously for over 25 days. We continue to support the Zephyr S program and were presented the 2021 Innovative Supplier of the Year Award by Airbus.
High Power Products. Our High Power products are designed for applications that place a premium on high power capabilities. For conventional high power lithium-ion batteries, specific energy typically ranges between 100-200 Wh/kg at 1C. In comparison, our High Power battery cells offer 350 Wh/kg at 1C and over 300 Wh/kg at 5C. In addition, these High Power cells are capable of fast charging such that they can charge from 0% to 80% in less than 6 minutes without performance degradation to cycle life or energy density. This level of power capability, energy density, and fast charge capability is optimal for the air transportation industry. The air transportation industry consists of either fixed-wing or eVTOL solutions, both of which require high power capabilities to lift the craft from the ground into the air. After the craft has reached “cruising altitude,” the requirements shift from power to energy, which determines the range the aircraft can travel. Once the vehicle has landed, the turnaround time to get the vehicle back into the air becomes critical, which is why we have designed our High Power products with fast charge capabilities.
In 2020, we began design and verification discussions with potential eVTOL customers. In 2021, we began a technical evaluation engagement with a tier-one eVTOL provider to develop an eVTOL-optimized battery system to support the development and commercialization of their eVTOL fleet. In 2022, we expanded our technical engagements with four additional eVTOL OEMs.
Balanced Energy/Power Products. Our Balanced Energy/Power products are designed for applications that desire a balance between power and energy. Rated for up to 3C continuous discharge, our balanced cell gravimetric energy ranges between 410 Wh/kg at 0.2C discharge rate and 320 Wh/kg at 3C discharge rate. This range of power capability is important to our UAS customers and our products typically meet UAS devices high initial power requirements (between 1-3C for takeoff and landing), as well as operational requirements at C/2 for cruise or hover states.
Since 2021, our Balanced Energy/Power products have been designed into programs at AeroVironment and Teledyne FLIR, with commercial shipments beginning in 2022.
EV-Capable Products in Development. We are currently developing an EV capable cell. Competition in the EV industry is intense, with high production volume requirements, low pricing, and balanced performance criteria, creating a 
Index to Consolidated Financial Statements

high barrier to entry against the incumbent solutions. Prior to us being able to effectively compete in the EV space, we will need to further improve cycle life, increase cell form factors, increase production quantity and reduce our costs.
Since 2017, we have been sampling our batteries with USABC, which has independently verified that we have met or exceeded the majority of their 2025 EV cell performance goals, including usable energy density, usable specific energy, power density and charge time. In 2022, we were awarded a contract from USABC in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") to develop a low-cost, fast-charge silicon anode battery that meets all of their 2025 EV cell characteristic targets. This program is scheduled to conclude in 2024 when we intend to deliver cells with a 99mm x 300mm (W x L) footprint and a capacity of at least 80Ah, having a beginning-of-life specific energy of no less than 400 Wh/kg, energy density of no less than 950 Wh/L, and a cycle life of 1,000 cycles.
Our Technology
Our proprietary silicon anode technologies solve for the inherent limitations of silicon anodes in lithium-ion cells. Silicon has historically been investigated as an anode material due to its intrinsic capability to store larger quantities of lithium per unit mass and volume compared to graphite. The main barrier preventing silicon from becoming more widely adopted across the battery industry is that the silicon material expands during charging as it absorbs lithium ions. For example, silicon particles may expand up to 300% during charging. After multiple charge and discharge cycles, silicon particles will crack, causing anode degradation and device breakdown.
Our proprietary silicon anode technology solves for the material expansion inherent with silicon. Our nanowire anodes start with a metal foil that is layered with a nanowire template and metallurgically attached to the metal foil substrate by a growth process. The nanowire template is coated with a low-density silicon and then encased by a thin layer of high-density silicon.
Our silicon anode generally contains more than 1,000,000 nanowires per square centimeter.
The nano-porosity of the low-density layer of silicon on each nanowire and the micro-porosity between the wires in our technology allows the silicon to expand at nano- and micro- meter levels when the anode is charged, with little to no damage to the anode.
Our anode structure also enables ions and electrons to travel in a straight path between and through the nanowires. In contrast, a particle structure results in ions and electrons traveling in a nonlinear, tortuous path. The straight path of our anode facilitates high electric and ionic conductivity, enabling high power and fast charging. Nanowires are always in electrical contact with the metal foil due to their growth rooted fabrication, while particles have to rely on particle-to-particle contact for electron transfer, which can easily be broken during cycling.
Our silicon anodes are considered 100% silicon based on the actual percentage of silicon of 99.5% to 99.9% which is within the range of acceptable purity levels that are considered 100%.
Manufacturing and Supply
We invented the proprietary silicon anode and its fabrication process. Our silicon anode is fabricated using chemical vapor deposition ("CVD") technology, and consists of three sequential steps. First, the nanowire template is grown by a thermally activated chemical reaction. Second, a low-density silicon coating is deposited by plasma enhanced CVD. Third, a high-density thin silicon surface layer is deposited by a thermally activated CVD process. These three steps replace all powder processing steps typically used in making graphite anodes, including powder mixing, slurry mixing, slurry coating, electrode drying and electrode calendaring. After fabrication, our product is the fully processed anode. This anode can then be assembled in cells with cathodes produced by manufacturing lines similar to those used in graphite anode cells. This fabrication process has been in commercial operation since 2018 with a kWh-scale manufacturing line at our headquarters in Fremont, California.
To develop the high volume anode fabrication tool needed for a GWh-scale manufacturing line, we have partnered with centrotherm international AG ("centrotherm"), a leading global supplier of tools used to produce wafers for solar cells. In October 2022, we received the first large-scale anode production machine, which is expected to increase our capacity for silicon anode production at our Fremont headquarters to approximately 2 MWh by the end of 2023. We have successfully fabricated silicon anodes with a solar wafer production tool made by centrotherm, but we will need to make certain modifications to the equipment for our needs. One modification is that we will replace wafers with large format foils, which we use in our kWh-scale production. This requires design and development of automated material handling for the 
Index to Consolidated Financial Statements

foils. This is one of the principal engineering tasks in adapting the solar cell production equipment to our needs and will be undertaken in collaboration with an engineering design firm.
Completing design and development of the tool as well as the automated material handling and high volume production processes requires significant engineering. The ability to do so successfully and the timing of this effort may be subject to unforeseen complexities, component supply delays and other risks. Moreover, our manufacturing costs will depend not only on the cost of the tools but also on throughput, yield, efficiency of silane gas utilization and other factors. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors including the risks described under “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Technology, Products and Manufacturing."
Although our anode processes differ from traditional anode manufacturing, the cathode and the rest of the cell—including electrolytes and separators—use conventional lithium-ion battery manufacturing tools and materials. Our silicon anodes are a direct drop-in replacement of the graphite anode in traditional lithium-ion batteries.
On January 20, 2023, we entered into a nonbinding letter of intent to lease premises consisting of approximately 774,000 square feet of space located in Brighton, Colorado. Subject to the finalization of the lease, we plan to build our GWh-scale manufacturing facility at this facility and procure manufacturing equipment for anode and cathode fabrication, cell assembly, and cell testing from established equipment suppliers. We have received commitments of state and local incentive packages providing approximately $10.0 million in tax incentives that are contingent on certain performance goals. 
The dominant raw materials for our silicon anode include silane gas, which is used in making the silicon anodes, and electrodeposited nickel foil, which is used for the anode current collector substrate. As we increase manufacturing capacity, we expect to procure the silane gas from a global supplier of silane and silicon materials and will procure nickel foil from global suppliers of electrodeposited metals. Both silane gas and nickel foil are available commodity materials.
Due to its high capacity to store lithium relative to cathode materials, and to further increase the available lithium in the cell, the silicon anode can be prelithiated to a certain level (i.e., 10-20%) of its capacity before cell assembly. Prelithiation can be done electrochemically at low scale and by physical vapor deposition for large manufacturing volume. Equipment vendors have scaled-up or are scaling lithium evaporation equipment to GWh+ manufacturing volumes. We use electrochemical prelithiation in our current production and will integrate lithium evaporation steps in the anode manufacturing line.
Our Growth Strategy
Our goal is to become the market leader in high performance lithium-ion batteries for the transportation industry. In order to achieve that goal, we are pursuing the following growth strategies:
Complete large-scale manufacturing facility to meet customer demand and optimize costs. We operate a kWh-scale manufacturing line at our headquarters in Fremont, California. In January 2023, we entered into an amendment to the lease agreement of our Fremont headquarters, pursuant to which we will lease approximately 25,000 square feet of additional space located in the same building as our current headquarters, where we are working to achieve production on a MWh-scale. To meet the demand for our batteries, we are also in the process of negotiating a lease for a facility in Brighton, Colorado, where we expect we will build a GWh-scale manufacturing facility. We plan to operate a MWh-scale manufacturing line at our Fremont headquarters as we design and build a GWh-scale manufacturing line in a modular form in Brighton. We expect that the initial phase of the Brighton facility will result in manufacturing capacity of 500 MWh and be operational in 2025. Thereafter, we expect to further expand as needed through a Copy Exact methodology. Our ability to grow depends on the successful establishment of our GWh-scale manufacturing facility, which, in turn, will depend on, among other things, our ability to raise additional capital.
Reduce our costs. We believe our ability to reduce the costs of our batteries on a $/kWh basis will accelerate the adoption of our batteries and allow us to further broaden our customer base. As we scale, we believe we will benefit from reduced per-unit costs, including overhead, labor and capital expenditures, improved tool utilization and volume pricing for equipment and materials. We will also seek to reduce costs by optimizing material utilization, throughput and yield. However, until we are able to complete our optimization process, including designing and implementing our silicon anode production process, we cannot accurately forecast our manufacturing costs. Based on our current expectations, we estimate that our capital equipment expenditures will range between $120.0 million and $150.0 million to achieve 1.0 GWh per year of manufacturing capacity. Because our silicon anode process requires different equipment than traditional anode manufacturing, our capital equipment costs are likely to be higher than equipment used for production of graphite anodes.

Extend first-mover advantage to become the market leader in lithium-ion batteries for aviation. We believe we are the leading company in the market today with a high-performance battery that can meet the requirements of aviation applications. We have built a strong reputation in the industry by delivering ultra-high performance batteries with high safety standards that meet or exceed industry standards and customer requirements. We expect to extend our presence in the aviation market, while also serving other transportation-related markets that require improvements in their electrification solutions. We are engaged with over 80 interested potential customers, 40 of which have tested and validated that our batteries exceed the technical requirements for their applications.
Further improve performance characteristics of our anode and battery cells. We believe we have the highest-performing commercially available batteries in the market. We intend to maintain our performance advantage by continuing to invest in our anode and cathode chemistries. We expect to continue to work to increase the performance characteristics of our batteries, particularly around power, energy density and cycle life. For example, in March 2023, our new prototype battery cells were verified to deliver energy density >504 WH/kg and >1321 WH/L at 25°C. The performance was verified by a leading testing house offering comprehensive battery regulatory compliance, safety and performance testing. We believe our next-generation cells, when commercially available, will have the potential to expand boundaries for our customers and provide a tailored solution for applications that require heightened discharge times without compromising key features, such as aircraft payload, and without having to increase vehicle weight. We will continue to invest in optimizing combinations of these performance characteristics as well as the requisite form factors to meet the specific needs of our customers and drive adoption of our battery cells in other areas of electrified transportation. As a result of these efforts, our goal is to fully realize the benefits of our silicon anode technology and develop the highest performing product in the market.
Expand our end markets and applications. As we increase our production capabilities, we will be able to supply our batteries in larger volumes to fulfill our customers’ battery prototyping and procurement requirements. Our current customer base consists primarily of aviation and other air transportation companies. We believe the batteries we have developed for the aviation industries can be adapted for larger form factors to meet the energy density and fast-charge requirements of the EV market once we are able to improve the cycle life, increase form factors, reduce cost and improve production quantity for our EV capable battery cells.
Research and Development
Our original silicon anode technology was developed at Stanford University in 2008, and for more than 10 years, we have refined and improved upon the technology for use in commercial applications. We have conducted research and development initiatives focused on improving certain performance characteristics and expanding the applications of our silicon anode battery technology. We expect to continue our research and development efforts in the following areas:
•Improving battery life: we are working with chemical compounds as potential additives to the silane gas we use to produce our silicon anodes which have demonstrated the potential to improve cycle life without negatively impacting other performance characteristics such as energy density.
•Further improvements to energy density: we are engaged in ongoing development activities to explore different cathode materials, including a conversion cathode, to further improve the energy density of our batteries.
•Larger cell form factors: the batteries we have developed and are developing for our customers are typically approximately 1.4-15Ah for small-sized aircraft. As we expand our customer base, we are in the process of developing larger form factor batteries for broader aviation applications and for EV customers.
We utilize our research and development capabilities not only to improve existing products but also to build custom-designed batteries for our customers. We have generated revenue from these design services. However, as we grow our manufacturing capacity, we expect that the relative percentage of our revenue from these activities will decrease.

Competition
We compete directly and indirectly with current battery manufacturers and with an increasing number of companies that are developing new battery technologies and chemistries to address the growing market for electrified mobility solutions. Specifically, within the aviation markets, we primarily compete with conventional graphite anode batteries and silicon composite anode batteries. Silicon composites are graphite-based anodes that incorporate some silicon, typically in the form of particles of silicon or silicon monoxide.
Graphite anode battery companies include tier-one manufacturers such as Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL), LG Chem Ltd., Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Panasonic Industry Co., Ltd., and Samsung SDI Co., Ltd., which provide higher quality and higher performance solutions, and tier-two manufacturers which provide lower cost solutions. We expect the manufacturers of those batteries will continue to invest in improving the capabilities of their batteries.
While we are currently the only known battery manufacturer making approximately 100% silicon anodes, there are many companies making or developing silicon composite batteries or anode materials and companies seeking to develop 100% silicon anodes. Companies making or developing silicon composite anodes or materials include both large manufacturers as well as many well-funded new technology companies. These include BTR New Energy Material Ltd., Enevate Corporation, Enovix Corporation, Group 14 Technologies, Inc., Nexeon Ltd., Sila Nanotechnologies Inc., Shanshan Corporation, Storedot Ltd., and Berzelius (Nanjing) Co. Ltd. (formerly known as Amprius (Nanjing) Co., Ltd., “Berzelius”), a former subsidiary of Amprius Holdings, among others. Dr. Sun, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Amprius Board, serves on the board of Berzelius and its holding company. Silicon composite anodes may offer higher energy density and other improvements over conventional graphite anodes, and may be less expensive to manufacture than our silicon anodes.
For aviation applications, we believe that the defining characteristics of our battery cells (e.g., industry-leading specific energy and energy density, high power density, low operating temperature and fast charge capability), in addition to commercial validation, significantly differentiates us from graphite anode and silicon composite anode alternatives, thus making our silicon anode technologies the only battery solutions currently available and suitable for broad aviation adoption. However, we expect additional competitors to enter the market as their battery technologies continue to improve.
The EV battery industry is fast-growing and highly competitive. Unlike the aviation industry, where there are a limited number of commercially available batteries that meet the minimum performance specifications, there are many battery manufacturers in the EV industry that can produce commercially acceptable batteries, and they can produce those batteries at lower cost and higher volumes than we are currently able to. Future entrants may include companies developing different technologies, such as lithium metal anodes, which are not yet in commercial production. In order to compete in the EV industry, we would need to improve cycle life, increase form factors, improve production quantity and reduce our manufacturing costs.
Many of our competitors and potential future entrants, both in the aviation and EV industries, may be better capitalized and have greater resources to commercialize and expand their production capacities. These competitors may have greater access to customers and may be able to establish cooperative or strategic relationships amongst themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their resources and competitive positioning. If there are significant advances in battery chemistries that we cannot adapt, or if competitors are able to scale their production capacities before we are able

to, our business may be materially impacted. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry" below.
Government Regulation and Compliance
Our business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and regulations. For example, there are various government regulations pertaining to battery safety, transportation of batteries, use of batteries in cars, factory safety, and disposal of hazardous materials.
In many cases, our products are or may in the future be subject to trade and export control laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions where we do business. Such laws may include the Export Administration Regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, trade and economic sanctions maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset Control as well as foreign direct investment rules and regulations, tariffs and quotas, and other related regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate. In particular, an export license may be required to export or re-export our products and technology to certain countries or end-users or for certain end-uses or may be prohibited. Additionally, we may be required to register with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in order to conduct some aspects of our future business activities and we may be required to obtain licenses in order to conduct development activities. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale or offering or business activity may not be possible or may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Any failure to adequately address these legal obligations could result in civil fines or suspension or loss of our export privileges, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
In addition, our business may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we have offices or do business, both domestic and abroad. Any failure to adequately comply with any of these obligations, or future changes with respect to any of these legal regimes, could cause us to incur significant costs, including the potential for new overhead costs, fines, sanctions, and third-party claims.
As a government contractor and/or subcontractor, we must comply with laws, regulations, and contractual provisions relating to the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts and grants, which affect how we and our partners do business with government agencies. Government contracts often contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide government customers with additional rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts. Ensuring compliance with government contracting laws, regulations, or contractual provisions may impose other added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements could lead to claims for damages, civil or criminal penalties, termination of contracts and/or suspension or debarment from obtaining government contracts and grants. Any such damages, penalties, disruption, or limitation in our ability to do business with a government could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, public perception and growth prospects.
Human Capital
We believe that our success is driven by our team of technology innovators and experienced business leaders. Many on our leadership team have been with Amprius over a decade. We seek to hire and develop employees who are dedicated to our strategic mission. As of December 31, 2022, we employed 58 full time employees, 4 temporary employees and 2 contractors based in our headquarters in Fremont, California and 1 full time employee and 1 contractor working remotely.
Our employees are the foundation of developing and commercializing our silicon anode technology. Ten of our employees are engaged in engineering, research and development and 43 are involved with battery manufacturing and production. Of our technical and operations staff, approximately 20% hold a Ph.D. or advanced degrees across material science, chemical, aerospace, structural and nanoscale engineering as well as physics and chemistry. We are committed to maintaining equitable compensation programs including equity participation. We offer market-competitive salaries and strong equity compensation aimed at attracting and retaining team members capable of making exceptional contributions to our success.
