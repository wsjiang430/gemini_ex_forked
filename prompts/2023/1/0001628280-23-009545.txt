ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
Leonardo DRS, Inc. provides advanced defense technology to U.S. national security customers and allies around the world. We specialize in the design, development and manufacture of advanced sensing, network computing, force protection as well as electric power and propulsion. Our innovative spirit and agility, together with our established market position in these areas have created a foundational and diverse base of programs across the DoD. We believe DRS is well positioned to not only support our customers in today’s mission but to also provide more autonomous, dynamic, interconnected, and multi-domain capabilities to defend against evolving and emerging threats. We view enhancement of capabilities in sensing, computing, self-protection and power as necessary to enable the strategic priorities of the DoD and our other customers.
DRS benefits from an over 50-year legacy in providing innovative and differentiated products and solutions for defense applications. From our earliest offerings to today’s best-in-class products including naval propulsion, electro-optical sensors and electronic warfare systems, we have continually developed advanced technologies to address complex national security challenges. We continue to target our investments toward high growth areas of the U.S. defense budget. Our diverse technologies, systems and solutions are used across land, air, sea, space and cyber domains on a wide range of platforms for the DoD and the defense agencies of our international allies. Across the spectrum of multi-domain operations, we believe our core capabilities will help the U.S. and its allies maintain a strategic advantage over their adversaries.
Our Company consists of eight business units which are organized as two operating segments: Advanced Sensing and Computing and Integrated Mission Systems. For information regarding segment performance see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.
Advanced Sensing and Computing 
Our Advanced Sensing and Computing (“ASC”) segment designs, develops and manufactures sensing and network computing technology that enables real-time situational awareness required for enhanced operational decision making and execution by our customers. 
Our sensing capabilities span numerous applications, including missions requiring advanced detection, precision targeting and surveillance sensing, long range electro-optic/infrared (“EO/IR”), signals intelligence (“SIGINT”) and other intelligence systems, electronic warfare (“EW”), ground vehicle sensing, next generation active electronically scanned array (“AESA”) tactical radars, dismounted soldier sensing and space sensing. Across our offerings, we are focused on advancing sensor distance and enhancing the precision, clarity, definition, spectral depth and effectiveness of our sensors. We also seek to leverage the knowledge and expertise built through our decades of experience to optimize size, weight, power and cost for our customers’ specific mission requirements.
Our sensing capabilities are complemented by our rugged, trusted and cyber resilient network computing products. Our network computing offerings are utilized across a broad range of mission applications including platform computing on ground and shipboard (both surface ship and submarine) for advanced battle management, combat systems, radar, command and control (“C2”), tactical networks, tactical computing and communications. These products help support the DoD’s need for greater situational understanding at the tactical edge by rapidly transmitting data securely between command centers and forward-positioned defense assets and personnel.
Integrated Mission Systems
 Our Integrated Mission Systems (“IMS”) segment designs, develops, manufactures and integrates power conversion, control and distribution systems, ship propulsion systems, motors and variable 
 1


frequency drives, force protection systems, and transportation and logistics systems for the U.S. military and allied defense customers. 
DRS is currently a leading provider of next-generation electrical propulsion systems for the U.S. Navy. We provide power conversion, control, distribution and propulsion systems for the Navy’s top priority shipbuilding programs, including the Columbia Class ballistic missile submarine, the first modern U.S. electric drive submarine. 
We believe DRS is well positioned to meet the needs of an increasingly electrified fleet with our high-efficiency, power dense permanent magnet motors, energy storage systems and associated efficient, rugged and compact power conversion, electrical actuation systems, and advanced cooling technologies. 
DRS has a long history of providing a number of other critical products to the U.S. Navy with a significant installed base on submarines, aircraft carriers and other surface ships including motor controllers, instrumentation and control equipment, electrical actuation systems, and thermal management systems for electronics and ship stores refrigeration.
DRS is also an integrator of complex systems in ground vehicles for short-range air defense, counter-unmanned aerial systems (“C-UAS”), and vehicle survivability and protection. Our short-range air defense systems integrate EW equipment, reconnaissance and surveillance systems, modular combat vehicle turrets, and stabilized sensor suites, as well as kinetic countermeasures to protect against evolving threats. Our force protection systems, including solutions for C-UAS and active protection systems on army vehicles help protect personnel and defense assets from enemy combatants.
U.S. Defense Market Trends 
The DoD budget is the largest defense budget in the world.
 The U.S. President’s government fiscal year 2024 budget request included $842 billion for national defense programs, which marks continued growth from prior years. The most recent National Defense Strategy and annual defense budget request continue to prioritize a strategic focus on countering and deterring threats from near-peer adversaries. We believe that the level and growth of the defense budget as well as strategic priorities requiring more advanced and sophisticated defense technology capabilities create a favorable market environment for DRS.
Customers
The U.S. government is our largest customer. Revenues derived directly or indirectly from the U.S. government represent 84%, 86% and 84% of our total revenue for full year 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Our U.S. government sales are concentrated with the DoD, which constitutes the majority of our U.S. government revenue for any given year, including the entirety of our government sales in 2022. Our revenues with the DoD span the Army, Navy, Air Force and other DoD agencies which represent 37%, 32%, 5% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenue for 2022.
The remaining 16% of our revenues for 2022, were derived from sales to foreign governments as well as commercial type sales within the U.S. and abroad. Our international sales consist primarily of transactions with foreign governments for defense applications. 
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive market and we compete with a variety of companies in the defense market including divisions of the large defense primes, mid-tier and smaller defense companies as well as certain non-traditional companies. To gain new business, we also often team with, are supplier to, or find other ways to work with other market participants. Our products are sold in markets in which several of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, enabling them to devote greater resources to research and development. The principal competitive factors evaluated by customers in our markets 
 2


include product performance, cost, overall value, delivery schedule, embedded positions, past performance, innovation and reputation.
Contracts
As a mid-tier defense company with a diverse portfolio of technology that includes offerings at the system, sub-system and component level, we approach each market opportunity with the flexibility and agility to provide the most value to our customers. We serve as either prime contractor or a subcontractor on key contracts based on the competitive dynamics of each opportunity. We determine our prime versus subcontract position based on our competitive position, likelihood of contract win and overall profit contribution. For 2022 our revenue consisted of 41% as a prime contractor direct with the government and 59% as a subcontractor. 
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from long-term programs and programs for which we are the incumbent supplier or have been the sole or dual supplier for many years. A significant percentage of our revenue is derived from programs that are in the production phase. 
While the majority of our revenue is derived from the U.S. government, we have a diverse business mix within the U.S. government funding and limited dependence on any single contract. Currently no single contract or platform represented more than 10% of our revenues for the 2022, 2021, and 2020 years. 
The amount of our revenues attributable to our contracts by contract type during 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows:
 | December 31,
($ in millions) | 2022 | | 2021 | 2020
Firm fixed price | $ | 2,347 | | $ | 2,498 | $ | 2,408
Flexibly priced (a) | $ | 346 | | $ | 381 | $ | 370 

(a) Includes revenue derived from cost type and time and materials contracts.
Typically we enter into three types of contracts: fixed price contracts, cost-plus contracts and time and material (“T&M”) contracts (cost-plus contracts and T&M contracts are aggregated above as flexibly priced contracts). Our contracts are normally for production, services or development. Production contracts are typically the fixed-price type, development contracts are sometimes of the cost-plus-type, and service contracts are sometimes the T&M type. We believe continued predominance of fixed-price contracts is reflective of the significant portion of production contracts in our U.S. government contract portfolio. 
•Fixed-price contracts may provide for a fixed price or they may be fixed-price-incentive-fee contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform for an agreed-upon price. Accordingly, we derive benefits from cost savings, but bear the risk of cost overruns. Under fixed-price-incentive-fee contracts, if actual costs incurred in the performance of the contracts are less than estimated costs for the contracts the savings are apportioned between the customer and us. If actual costs under such a contract exceed estimated costs, however, excess costs are apportioned between the customer and us, up to a ceiling. We bear all costs that exceed the ceiling, if any.
•Cost-type contracts include cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts. Cost-type contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee. As a result, cost-type contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation. Fees on cost-type contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees, which are generally based on performance 
 3


criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and/or technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the Company’s performance against contractual criteria. Incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met. Award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.
•Time-and-material type contracts provide for reimbursement of labor hours expended at a contractual fixed labor rate per hour, plus the actual costs of material and other direct non-labor costs. The fixed labor rates on time-and-material type contracts include amounts for the cost of direct labor, indirect contract costs and profit.
Backlog
Our total backlog consists of funded and unfunded amounts. Funded backlog represents the revenue value of orders for services under existing contracts for which funding is appropriated or otherwise authorized less revenue previously recognized on these contracts. Unfunded backlog represents the revenue value of firm orders for products and services under existing contracts for which funding has not been obligated less funding previously recognized on these contracts.

 | December 31,
(Dollars in millions) | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Backlog: | | | | | 
Funded(1) | $ | 2,783 | | | $ | 2,510 | | $ | 2,847
Unfunded(1) | 1,486 | | | 351 | | | 444
Total backlog(1) | $ | 4,269 | | | $ | 2,861 | | $ | 3,291

________________
(1)See Part I Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We may not realize the full value of our total estimated contract value or bookings, including as a result of reduction of funding or cancellation of our U.S. government contracts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations” in this Annual Report. 
Materials, Manufacturing and Suppliers
Our manufacturing processes for our products include the assembly of purchased components and subsystems and testing of products at various stages in the assembly process. Although materials and purchased components generally are available from a number of different suppliers, several suppliers serve as the sole source of certain components. If a supplier should cease to deliver such components, generally we would expect that other sources would be available; however, added cost and manufacturing delays might result. We have experienced delays attributable to supply shortages and quality and other related problems with respect to certain components. 
Effective management and oversight of suppliers and subcontractors is an important element of our successful performance. If our sources of supply are disrupted, particularly in instances where we rely on only one or two sources of supply, our ability to meet our customer commitments could be adversely impacted. We attempt to mitigate risks with our suppliers by entering into long-term agreements and leveraging company-wide agreements to achieve economies of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing terms in our customer contracts. Revenue, profit and cash flows have been, and will continue to be, adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions.
Research and Development
 4


We conduct research and development (“R&D”) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded R&D or independent research and development (“IR&D”)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers (referred to as customer-funded R&D) to enhance existing products and services and to develop future technologies. R&D costs include basic research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and related test activities. IR&D costs are allocated to customer contracts as part of the general and administrative overhead costs and generally recoverable on our customer contracts with the U.S. Government. Customer-funded R&D costs are charged directly to the related customer contract. Substantially all R&D costs are charged to cost of revenues as incurred. Company-funded R&D costs charged to cost of revenues totaled $58 million, $48 million and $41 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Intellectual Property
We believe our intellectual property portfolio is valuable to our operations. We have patents on certain of our technologies and methods, semiconductor devices, rugged computer-related items and electro-optical and infrared focal plane array products, in addition to other technologies and methods. We and our subsidiaries have certain registered trademarks, none of which are considered material to our current operations. We also hold certain trade secrets without formal patent filings when we deem it most appropriate to do so, including in order to protect them from disclosure. We do not believe that the conduct of our business as a whole is materially dependent on any single patent, trade secret, trademark or copyright.
When we work on U.S. government contracts or use funding of the U.S. government, the U.S. government may have contractual rights to data for our technologies, source code and other developments associated with such government contracts. Records of our data rights are typically maintained in order to claim these rights as our proprietary technology, but it may not always be possible to delineate our proprietary developments from those developed under U.S. government contracts. The protection of our data from use by the U.S. government, including its ability to allow its use by other U.S. government contractors, is subject to negotiation from time to time between us and the U.S. government. The extent of the U.S. government’s data rights to any particular product generally depends upon whether the product was developed under a government contract and the degree of government funding for the development of such product. While we may retain rights over any technology, product or intellectual property that we develop under U.S. government contracts or using funding of the U.S. government, this requires us to have sufficient contracting leverage and to take timely affirmative measures to preserve our right.
Human Capital
Our performance is dependent on our highly educated and highly skilled workforce. We had approximately 6,400 employees on December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 451 (or 7)% of our employees were represented by labor unions. We strive to maintain a culture that fosters and rewards growth, problem-solving, technology development and process improvements. Our engineers work on programs in advanced fields, including sensing, electro-optical infrared systems, laser systems, network computing, communications systems, integration and power propulsion. A portion of our employees also maintain security clearances to allow engineers and management to carry on business activities for our customers’ classified programs. 
Our people are all committed to upholding the core values of the Company including integrity, operational excellence, customer focus, diversity, equity & inclusion and innovation. Our commitment to ethical business practices is outlined in our Code of Ethics & Business conduct (the “Code”). The Code applies to all employees and establishes our expectations for appropriate business conduct is a variety of scenarios. Once a year, all employees must confirm their commitment to our ethics program by providing confirmation they will adhere to the Code.

We recognize that our success as a Company depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain a qualified workforce with an emphasis on a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion. As such, we promote the health, welfare and safety of our employees and seek to treat all employees with dignity and respect and provide fair, market-based, competitive and equitable compensation. We strive to recognize and reward the performance of our employees and to provide a comprehensive suite of benefit options that enables our employees and their dependents to live healthy and productive lives.
Safety in our workplaces is paramount. Across our businesses, we take measures to prevent workplace hazards, encourage safe behaviors and enforce a culture of continuous improvement to ensure our processes help reduce incidents and illnesses and comply with governing health and safety laws. 
Our strong commitment to diversity, inclusion, succession planning and training includes our Diversity Advisory Group geared at improving diversity and inclusiveness so that we look like the communities in which we operate. We have targeted increases in minority hiring and expanding women in the workforce. 
Our values motivate us to promote strong workplace practices with opportunities for development and training. Our training and development efforts focus on ensuring that the workforce is appropriately trained on critical job skills as well as leadership behaviors that are consistent with our core values. We conduct rigorous succession planning exercises to ensure that key positions have the appropriate level of bench strength to provide for future key positions and leadership transitions. We listen to our workforce to assess areas of concern and levels of engagement.
Joint Ventures, Strategic Investments and Mergers and Acquisitions
On June 21, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with RADA Electronic Industries Ltd. (“RADA”), a leading provider of advanced software-defined military tactical radars, to merge and become a combined public company. On November 28, 2022 the merger was completed and RADA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leonardo DRS. As a result of the merger, we now hold an approximately 12% interest in RadSee Technologies Ltd. an early-stage radar technology company organized in Israel.
On March 21, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Global Enterprise Solutions business to SES Government Solutions, Inc. The transaction was completed on August 1, 2022 and resulted in net cash proceeds of $427 million after net working capital adjustments.
On April 19, 2022 we entered into a definitive sales agreement to divest our share of our current equity investment in Advanced Acoustic Concepts LLC to Thales Defense & Security, Inc. (TDSI), the minority partner in this joint venture. The transaction was completed on July 8, 2022 and resulted in proceeds of $56 million.
We also hold an approximately 10% interest in Hoverfly Technologies, Inc. (“Hoverfly”), which designs, develops and manufactures power-tethered unmanned aerial systems and related products. We are also party to an exclusive manufacturing and teaming agreement with Hoverfly.
Seasonality
We do not consider any material portion of our business to be seasonal. However, a significant portion of our revenue, profit and cash flows are generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Various factors can affect the distribution of our revenues, profits and cash flows between accounting periods, including the U.S. federal government’s budget cycle based on its October-to-September fiscal year (which can lead to customers making orders in the weeks and days leading up to September 30 to avoid the loss of expiring and unobligated funds), the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, the timing of costs incurred (including when materials are received), product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Product Warranties
Product warranty costs generally are accrued in proportion to product revenue realized in conjunction with our over-time revenue recognition policy. Product warranty expense is recognized based on the term of the product warranty, generally one to three years, and the related estimated costs, considering historical claims expense. Accrued warranty costs are reduced as these costs are incurred and as the warranty period expires, and otherwise may be modified as specific product performance issues are identified and resolved. 
Legislation and Regulation 
As a U.S. government contractor, we (and our subcontractors and others with whom we do business) must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other specific legal requirements. These regulations and other requirements increase our performance and compliance costs and risks and regularly evolve. New laws, regulations or procurement requirements or changes to current ones (including, for example, regulations related to cybersecurity, privacy, recovery of employee compensation costs, counterfeit parts, anti-human trafficking, specialty metals and conflict minerals) can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability. If we fail to comply with procurement regulations or other requirements we may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which may include termination or modification of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Part I Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We are subject to a number of procurement, international trade, and other rules regulations and requirements related to our industry, our products, and the businesses we operate. If we fail to comply with such rules, regulations or other requirements we may be subject to civil and/or criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions” in this Annual Report.
We (again, including our subcontractors and others with whom we do business) also are subject to, and expected to perform in compliance with, a vast array of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and requirements related to our industry, our products and the businesses we operate. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to the Anti-Kickback Act, the Arms Export Control Act, including the ITAR, the Communications Act, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Export Control Reform Act, including the EAR (which includes anti-boycott provisions), the False Claims Act, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the FCPA, the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act, the Foreign Trade Regulations, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Trading with the Enemy Act, and Executive Orders and regulations, administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as rules and regulations administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. If we are found to have violated such requirements, we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts; contract modifications or termination; the withholding of payments from our customer; the loss of export privileges; administrative or civil judgments and liabilities; criminal judgments or convictions, liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements; other sanctions; the assessment of penalties, fines, or compensatory, treble or other damages or non-monetary relief or actions; or suspension or debarment.
Our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials. We are subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. See Part I Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and our ongoing operations may expose us to environmental liabilities affecting our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations” in this Annual Report. Except as described in Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we believe that we have been and are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations and that we have no liabilities under environmental requirements that 
 7


would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. It is possible, however, that the ultimate resolution of the matters discussed under Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular reporting period, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Governance Structure
As a U.S. defense contractor with high level personnel and facility security clearances, DRS, our immediate majority stockholder US Holding, LLC and our ultimate majority stockholder Leonardo S.p.A. have entered into a proxy agreement with the DoD to mitigate against the potential for undue foreign ownership control and influence (“FOCI”) on the performance of classified programs by implementing various limitations on US Holding’s and Leonardo S.p.A.’s rights as the direct foreign majority stockholder of DRS, respectively. Specifically, US Holding has authorized certain cleared U.S. persons to operate as its proxies and exercise the key prerogatives of stock ownership. We are currently operating under an interim proxy agreement while we seek to enter into a new proxy agreement with the DoD. The proxy agreement requires that DRS have the financial and operational ability to operate as an independent entity under an independent Board, subject to certain limited, enumerated consent rights of the majority stockholder (including material mergers and acquisitions and incurrence of debt). See Part I Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Ownership and Status under the Proxy Agreement — We operate under a proxy agreement with the DoD that regulates significant areas of our governance. If we fail to comply with the proxy agreement our classified U.S. government contracts could be terminated, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations” in this Annual Report.
At all times subject to the proxy agreement, on November 28, 2022 the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) as well as a cooperation agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) with Leonardo S.p.A and US Holding. The Registration Rights Agreement, among other things, provides Leonardo S.p.A. and its affiliated entities with customary demand, shelf and piggy-back registration rights to facilitate a public offering of the Company Common Stock held by US Holding. The Cooperation Agreement, among other things, (a) Leonardo S.p.A. has certain consent, access and cooperation rights, (b) US Holding has certain consent rights with respect to actions taken by the Company and its subsidiaries, including with respect to the creation or issuance of any new classes or series of stock (subject to customary exceptions), listing or delisting from any securities exchange, and making material changes to the Company’s accounting policies and changing the Company’s auditor, and (c) neither US Holding nor Leonardo S.p.A. has the ability to transfer any Company voting securities for a period of six months following the merger with RADA, except in connection with a change in control of the Company or for transfers to affiliates.
Our Ultimate Majority Stockholder
Leonardo S.p.A., a global high-technology company, is a leading global Aerospace, Defense and Security company and Italy’s main industrial company. Organized into five business Sectors, Leonardo S.p.A. has a significant industrial presence in Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Switzerland and the USA, where it operates through subsidiaries, joint ventures and partnerships as: GIE ATR, MBDA, Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space, Hensoldt AG and other minor entities. Leonardo S.p.A. competes in the most important international markets by leveraging its areas of technological and product leadership (Helicopters, Defense Electronics & Security, Aircraft, Aerostructures and Space). Listed on the Milan Stock Exchange (under the trading symbol “LDO”), in 2022 Leonardo S.p.A. recorded consolidated revenues of €14.7 billion and invested €2.0 billion in R&D. The group has been part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (“DJSI”) since 2010 and was again named as sustainability global leader in the Aerospace & Defense sector of DJSI in 2022.
