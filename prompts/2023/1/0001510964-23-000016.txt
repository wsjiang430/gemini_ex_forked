Hemp-based CBD is one of more than 100 cannabinoids found in hemp and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based operations oversee our raw material supply chain, raw material processing, product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We will continue to scale operations to accommodate market conditions.
We are also developing cannabinoids intended to treat medical indications. Cannabinoids are compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, which contains two primary cannabinoids, CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has promising results in treating a range of medical indications. We acquired drug development assets utilizing CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our CanX acquisition.
Our first product candidate, CVSI-007, combines CBD and nicotine in treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. There are currently no drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for treatment of smokeless tobacco use and addiction. The worldwide smokeless tobacco addiction treatment market is estimated at greater than $2 billion. We believe this product candidate will provide treatment options for this significant unmet medical need. CVSI-007 is based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology. In May 2016, we filed a patent application for the technology implemented for CVSI-007 with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). On May 19, 2020, we received a formal notice of issuance from the USPTO for our patent application 15/426,617. The patent covers methods of treating smokeless tobacco addiction by administering pharmaceutical formulations containing CBD and nicotine. We are pursuing similar patent protection in other key markets throughout the world. As of December 31, 2022, our patent has been granted in 10 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, Netherlands, and Japan. 
We expect to continue our development efforts as we seek approval from the FDA to commercialize the world's first and only FDA-approved treatment for smokeless tobacco addiction. We currently contract with qualified parties and contract research organizations for our preclinical research and Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) preparation and development. Commercialization of future specialty pharmaceutical products in the United States and other territories may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could include a sales organization, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. However, we anticipate that building such a commercial infrastructure will require significant investment.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, management implemented, and continues to make and implement, strategic cost reductions, including reductions in employee headcount, vendor spending, and the delaying of certain expenses related to our drug development activities in order to ensure the success of our business. In addition, on July 12, 2021, we entered into a lease termination agreement for our old facility located in San Diego, California. Our old facility consisted of approximately 30,000 square feet of leased office, production, lab and warehouse space and had a total lease obligation of $3.8 million. We ceased using the old facility on June 2, 2022. Our new facility consists of approximately 6,000 square feet of leased office and warehouse space located in San Diego with a total lease obligation of $0.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we started outsourcing the majority of our manufacturing, warehousing and fulfillment functions. 
Description of our Subsidiaries
CV Sciences was incorporated under the name Foreclosure Solutions, Inc. in the State of Texas on December 9, 2010. On July 25, 2013, CannaVest Corp., a Texas corporation (“CannaVest Texas”), merged with CV Sciences, a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of CannaVest Texas, to effectuate a change in the Company’s state of incorporation from Texas to Delaware. On January 4, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation reflecting our corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.”, effective on January 5, 2016. In addition, on January 4, 2016, we amended our Bylaws to reflect our corporate name change to “CV Sciences, Inc.” As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not own any interest in any subsidiaries. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to local and federal laws and regulations pertaining to the sale of hemp derived CBD products in our operating jurisdictions. We maintain required licenses for sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution; we also monitor changes in laws, regulations, treaties, and agreements on a continuous basis. We derive our revenue from the manufacture, marketing and distribution of hemp extracts and other proven, science-backed, natural ingredients and products. 
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, known as the "2018 Farm Bill", is United States federal legislation signed into law on December 20, 2018, that provides the legal framework for hemp-based products. The 2018 Farm Bill permanently removed “hemp” from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, and accordingly, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) no longer has any claim to interfere with the interstate commerce of hemp products. One of the immediate impacts from this legislation included the ability for hemp farmers to access crop insurance and U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) programs for competitive grants. 
Notwithstanding the removal of the DEA from enforcement of hemp regulations, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) retains authority to regulate ingestible and topical hemp products, including hemp extracts that contain CBD, at the federal level. Moreover, states have retained regulatory authority through their own analogues to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), and the laws and regulations of certain states diverge from the laws and regulations of other states as well as from the federal treatment of the use of hemp as, or in, food, dietary supplements or cosmetic products. Each state also has a certain level of discretion to develop and implement its own laws and regulations governing the manufacturing, composition, marketing, labeling and sale of hemp products, which has created a patchwork of different regulatory schemes applicable to such products throughout the U.S. We actively monitor federal and state regulations and proposed regulations to ensure compliance.
In conjunction with the enactment of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA released a statement about the regulatory status of CBD. The statement noted that the 2018 Farm Bill explicitly preserved the FDA’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the FDCA and Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. This authority allows the FDA to continue enforcing the law to protect the public while also providing potential regulatory pathways for products containing cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds. The statement also noted the growing public interest in cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, and informed the public that the FDA will treat products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds as it does any other FDA-regulated products — meaning the products will be subject to the same authorities and requirements as FDA-regulated products containing any other substance, regardless of the source of the substance, including whether the substance is derived from a plant that is classified as hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill. The FDA’s CBD enforcement discretion and regulatory actions with regards to CBD provide regulatory guidance to the CBD industry. 
The FDA has consistently taken the position that CBD is prohibited from use as an ingredient in food and dietary supplements. This stems from its interpretation of the exclusionary clauses in the FDCA because CBD has been approved as a prescription drug and is the subject of substantial clinical investigations as a drug, which have been made public. The exclusionary clauses under the FDCA provide that a substance that has been approved or has been subject to substantial clinical investigations as a drug may not be used in a food or dietary supplement, unless the substance was first marketed in a food or dietary supplement prior to the initiation of substantial clinical investigations of the substance as a drug. The exclusionary clause does not apply to cosmetics. Cosmetics containing CBD could be viewed as drug products by the FDA if disease claims are made, or if the FDA determines the use of CBD in the product has a structure or function effect on the body (i.e., a drug effect).
To date, and to our knowledge based upon publicly available information, the FDA has neither issued regulations elaborating on the exclusionary clauses nor has it taken any enforcement action in the courts asserting a violation of the exclusionary clauses. However, the FDA has issued a number of warning letters to companies unlawfully marketing CBD products. In many of these cases, the manufacturers made unsubstantiated claims about the product being effective for the treatment of medical conditions (e.g., cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, opioid withdrawal, anxiety and COVID-19), despite not having obtained drug approvals. Other warning letters were issued to companies for a variety of reasons, including: marketing CBD products as dietary supplements despite those products which contain CBD not meeting the definition of a dietary supplement; adding CBD to human and animal foods and marketing CBD products for infants and children and other vulnerable populations; selling CBD products that people may confuse for traditional foods or beverages and that may result in unintentional consumption or overconsumption of CBD; and selling unapproved animal drugs containing CBD that are intended for use in food-producing animals. Some of these letters were co-signed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and cited the companies for making claims about the efficacy of CBD and other ingredients which were not substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. In December 2020, the FTC announced it had entered into settlement agreements with six companies marketing CBD products including oils, gummies, creams, and others with deceptive health claims about serious health conditions. The settlements included monetary penalties ranging from $20,000 to $85,000. The FTC announced another such enforcement action and settlement in May 2021, ordering consumer redress of over $30,000. The FDA has also issued warning letters to dietary supplement manufacturers objecting to the designation of CBD infused products as dietary supplements on the basis that CBD was not a permissible dietary supplement ingredient.
The FDA periodically updates its “Consumer Update” on CBD. Through these Consumer Updates, the FDA has noted that it has approved only one CBD product, a prescription drug product to treat three rare, severe forms of epilepsy. The FDA has also stated that it is illegal to market CBD by adding it to a food or labeling it as a dietary supplement, that the FDA has seen only limited data about CBD safety, which data indicates that there are real risks that need to be considered before taking CBD for any reason and that some CBD products are being marketed with unproven medical claims and are of unknown quality.
The FDA has stated that it recognizes the potential opportunities and significant interest in drug and other consumer products containing CBD, is committed to evaluating the agency’s regulatory policies related to CBD and has established a dedicated internal working group, the Cannabis Product Committee, to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. The FDA held a public hearing in May 2019 to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds. The rules and regulations and enforcement in this area continue to evolve and develop. In July 2020, the FDA sent to the White House Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB”) for review a draft guidance, “Cannabidiol Enforcement Policy,” the details of which were not made public. This guidance remained under review at the OMB until January 2021, when it was withdrawn by the FDA as a part of the regulatory moratorium Executive Order issued by President Biden. On January 26, 2023, the FDA stated its views publicly that a new regulatory pathway for CBD is needed and it is prepared to work with Congress to create such a pathway. The timeline for further CBD policy development remains uncertain while the administration and the FDA face competing regulatory priorities.
In October 2021, Assembly Bill 45 passed in California, permitting the retail sale of products containing hemp-derived CBD including dietary supplements, topicals, over-the-counter and pet products. 
We are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-public information; the handling of customer complaints; the requirement to provide warnings about exposures to chemicals with adverse health effects; and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. 
The growth and demand for online commerce has resulted in more stringent consumer protection laws, at both state and federal levels, that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These laws cover issues such as user privacy, spyware and the tracking of consumer activities, marketing e-mails and communications, other advertising and promotional practices, money transfers, pricing, product safety, content and quality of products and services, taxation, electronic contracts and other communications and information security.
There is uncertainty over whether or how existing laws governing issues such as sales and other taxes, auctions, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet and commercial online services. These issues are predicted to take years to resolve. For example, tax authorities in some states, as well as a Congressional advisory commission, are currently reviewing the appropriate tax treatment of companies engaged in online commerce. Furthermore, new state tax regulations may subject CV Sciences to additional state sales and income taxes. Other areas that may result in significant additional taxes or regulatory restrictions include, without limitation, new legislation or regulation; the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and commercial online services. These taxes or restrictions could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, output, and overall financial condition. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be financially responsible for past failures to comply with requirements.
Sales and Distribution
Our products are currently sold online through our websites (www.pluscbdoil.com and www.cvsciences.com), select distributors, brick and mortar retailers, and select e-tailers. We have relationships with wholesalers, distributors and retailers across the food, drug and mass ("FDM"), natural product, specialty, and professional market industries. We utilize our knowledgeable partners to display and present our products to customers in their brick and mortar stores. These relationships are important to ensure consumers across a variety of sales channels have access to our products. These partnerships and our expansive distribution allow us to build consumer trust in our brand and products. We have additional partners in the natural product channel to service our retail customers by stocking and displaying products and explaining product attributes and health benefits. We also utilize e-commerce platforms to reach consumers and guide them through the CBD buying process as we believe consumers rely heavily on digital research. 
36% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was attributable to sales of new products launched since May 2021. During this time period, we launched the following new products:
•PlusCBDTM Calm and Sleep, to support healthy stress response and improve sleep cycles, 
•PlusCBDTM Relief Softgels, to promote healthy inflammatory response and manage occasional soreness,
•PlusCBDTM Pain Relief topicals, to pinpoint sources of minor pain and aches, and
•ProCBDTM, a full product line exclusively through health care practitioners.
Markets, Geography, Seasonality, and Major Customers
Our products are predominantly sold in North America and primarily in the retail space. Based on our current and historical balance sheets and statement of operations, it does not appear that our business or operations experience any seasonality with respect to our sales, as any such seasonality appears to be unpredictable. Although we believe our customers’ historical buying patterns and budgetary cycles may be a factor that impacts our annual and quarterly sales results, we are not able to reliably predict our sales based on seasonality because outside factors (timing of orders, introduction of new products, and other economic factors impacting our industry) can also substantially impact our sales patterns during the year.
Furthermore, because the majority of our sales are spread amongst various retailers, distributors, and direct consumers, our largest customer only accounted for approximately 2% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, we do not believe our financial condition and results of operations is dependent on any one particular major customer. 
Working Capital Items
We believe that our inventory levels are currently adequate for our short-term needs based upon present level of demand. We consider our products to be generally available and current suppliers to be reliable and capable of satisfying anticipated needs.
Competition
The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly competitive and fragmented with numerous companies, consisting of publicly- and privately-owned companies, such as Charlotte's Web Holdings Inc., cbdMD, Inc., Medterra CBD, Inc., and many others. There are also large, well-funded companies that have indicated their intention to compete in the hemp-based product category in the U.S. We routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities to optimize value for shareholders through new product development or by asset acquisitions or sales and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize in the growing CBD product category. 
There are several companies developing cannabinoid therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The cannabinoid therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD or THC, or a combination of CBD and THC as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals plc have focused on plant-based CBD formulations, while other companies such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Insys Therapeutics, Inc. have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.
Intellectual Property
We have filed trademark applications on our brands, logos and marks in the U.S. and internationally. On January 30, 2016, we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our utility patent application number 14/791,184, Novel Process for Generating Hemp Oil with a High CBD Content. This patent covers our solvent-free and highly repeatable process for producing hemp oil with higher concentrations of CBD and expires in 2033.
In May 2016, we filed a patent application for our product candidate CVSI-007 with the USPTO. On May 19, 2020, we received formal notice of issuance from the USPTO for our patent application 15/426,617. The patent covers methods of treating smokeless tobacco addiction by administering pharmaceutical formulations containing CBD and nicotine. We are pursuing similar patent protection in other key markets throughout the world. As of December 31, 2022, our patent has been granted in 10 countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, Netherlands, and Japan.
We review our intellectual property portfolio on a periodic basis, and we will continue to broaden our portfolio in a fiscally prudent manner. In addition to our trademarks (both registered and unregistered) and patents, we rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. 
Research and Development
Our research and development costs have consisted primarily of salaries and related personnel expense, facilities and equipment expense and other costs. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred in the ongoing development of new consumer products and in development of our drug candidate CVSI-007. We established a cross-functional innovation process for our consumer products development using a modified stage gate process. Our new product development activities include ideation and feasibility, product development, scaleup and validation, and product launch. We incurred research and development expenses of $0.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Raw Materials and Product Manufacturing
We have invested significant capital to develop and maintain relationships with growers on a global scale to ensure access to raw materials to support anticipated revenue growth. We have historically sourced our raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. In addition, we have developed relationships with hemp growers in the United States and purchase raw materials domestically as well. We have maintained access to these growers for their raw material supply and continue to explore and develop other relationships to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for hemp-based consumer products well into the future. 
We are committed to producing quality products and testing transparency. Our goals include the optimization of our product manufacturing processes and the sourcing of reliable, high-quality raw materials. Our testing procedures are robust and comprehensive, starting with a supply chain built through our supplier verification program. All incoming cannabinoid ingredients are required to be first tested by the supplier at an independent, ISO accredited, third-party laboratory before they reach our production facilities and a Certificate of Analysis provided with each delivery. We then have the cannabinoid ingredients re-tested by an independent, ISO accredited, third-party laboratory to verify the supplier results before they are released into our production process. Final verification is performed by an independent ISO accredited third-party laboratory to ensure the finished products meet our high standards. 
We are dedicated to providing the highest quality CBD consumer products on the market. We strive to meet or exceed the FDAs GMP guidelines. These guidelines provide a system of processes, procedures and documentation to assure a product has the identity, strength, composition, quality and purity that appear on its label. Our third party manufacturers use FDA-registered facilities, which are independently GMP certified and subject to continuing independent audit and certification. 
Environmental Matters
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company's operations, and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental health and safety requirements have not been material. 
Furthermore, compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. However, we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
Employees
We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 44 employees, which included 42 full-time and 2 part-time employees, compared to 71 employees as of December 31, 2021. As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we reduced our employee headcount in connection with our efforts to decrease our costs. In addition to our full-time employees, we contract with third-parties for the conduct of certain marketing, sales and manufacturing efforts as well as certain preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities related to drug development efforts. Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we took actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our employees, so they could more safely and effectively perform their work. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees. 
Company Websites
We maintain a corporate Internet website at: www.cvsciences.com. In addition, we sell our products online at: www.pluscbdoil.com. The contents of these websites are not incorporated in or otherwise to be regarded as part of this Annual Report. 
We file reports with the SEC, which are available on our website free of charge. These reports include annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, “Section 16” filings on Form 3, Form 4, and Form 5, and other related filings, each of which is provided on our website as soon as reasonably practical after we electronically file such materials with or furnish them to the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, including the Company.
