Corporate History
 
Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. (“TSOI” or the “Company”) was organized August 6, 2007 under the name Friendly Auto Dealers, Inc., under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first quarter of 2011 the Company changed its name from Friendly Auto Dealers, Inc. to Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc., and acquired Splint Decisions, Inc., a California corporation.
 
On December 17, 2020, Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc. Board of Directors made a decision to move our corporate headquarters to Elk City, Idaho 83525 and has purchased real property at 701 Wild Rose Lane and 50 Bullock Lane, Elk City Idaho 83525. The Company continues to maintain a satellite office at the current address of 4093 Oceanside Blvd., Suite B, Oceanside CA, 92056.
 
Business Description
 
Currently the Company is focused on immune modulation for the treatment of several specific diseases. Immune modulation refers to the ability to upregulate (make more active) or downregulate (make less active) one’s immune system.
 
Activating one’s immune system is now an accepted method to treat certain cancers, reduce recovery time from viral or bacterial infections and to prevent illness. Additionally, inhibiting one’s immune system is vital for reducing inflammation, autoimmune disorders and allergic reactions.
 
TSOI is developing a range of immune-modulatory agents to target certain cancers, schizophrenia, suicidal ideation, traumatic brain injury, and for daily health.
 
Nutraceutical Division – TSOI has been producing high quality nutraceuticals. Its current flagship product, QuadraMune®, is a multi-patented synergistic blend of pterostilbene, sulforaphane, epigallocatechingallate, and thymoquinone. QuadraMune has been shown to increase Natural Killer Cell activity and healthy Cytokine production. Our synergistic blend of ingredients helps the immune system fight off common and complex ailments and promote healthy T Cell activity. Recently the Company was approved to sell certain nutraceuticals on the Amazon Platform.
 
Cellular Division – TSOI obtained exclusive rights to a patented adult stem cell for development of therapeutics in the area of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Lung Pathology (LP).
 
The stem cell licensed, termed “JadiCell” is unique in that it possesses features of mesenchymal stem cells, however, outperforms these cells in terms of a) enhanced growth factor production; b) augmented ability to secrete exosomes; and c) superior angiogenic and neurogenic ability.
 
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is caused by repetitive concussive/sub-concussive hits to the head sustained over a period of years and is often found in football players. The condition is characterized by memory loss, impulsive/erratic behavior, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, and dementia. In many patients with CTE, it is anatomically characterized by brain atrophy, reduced mass of frontal and temporal cortices, and medial temporal lobe. TSOI has previously filed several patents in the area of CTE based on modulating the brain microenvironment to enhance receptivity of regenerative cells such as stem cells. On March 4, 2021, the Company received an IND Serial # 27377 for a clinical trial of 10 patients with CTE.
 
On August 4th, 2021, the Company announced clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a Phase III pivotal trial for registration of the Company’s JadiCell™ universal donor stem cell as a treatment for COVID-19 associated lung failure under IND # 19757. In previous studies the Company has demonstrated the superior activity of JadiCell to other types of stem cells including bone marrow, adipose, cord blood, and placenta. Furthermore, the JadiCell was shown to be 100% effective in saving the lives of COVID-19 patients under the age of 85 in a double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial with patients in the ICU on a ventilator. In patients over the age of 85 the survival rate was 91%. The Company also recently announced the launching of Phase III for IND # 19757 with Biorasi LLC, a global, full-service CRO, who will run the clinical trial.
 
In addition, the Company has filed data with the FDA, as part of IND #17448, which demonstrated that treatment of cancer patients with StemVacs™ resulted in enhanced activity of a type of immunological cell called “natural killer” cells, otherwise known as “NK cells.”
 
The Company has also developed an allogenic version of StemVacs and has filed patents to cover activating universal donor immune system cells called dendritic cells in a manner so that upon injection they reprogram the body’s NK cells.
 
Most recently the Company announced filing of a patent application covering the use of JadiCells™ for treatment of epilepsy and associated conditions.

Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) – Right To Try
 
On December 10, 2018, Therapeutic Solutions International, Inc., announced the signing of an agreement between TSOI and Jadi Cell LLC for licensing of the Jadi Cell universal donor adult stem cell, as covered in US Patent No.: 9,803,176 B2 for use in Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).
 
In addition, on February 9, 2021, we obtained exclusive rights under the same for use of US Patent No.: 9,803,176 B2 in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other lung pathologies. The JadiCell was reported in a publication from the University of Miami following a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, demonstrating intravenous administration of JadiCells, resulted in a significant survival improvement in COVID-19 patients. The Phase 1/2 double blind, placebo-controlled trial treated 12 advanced COVID-19 patients with 100 million JadiCells™ intravenously at days 0 and 3, and 12 patients received placebo control. At 28 days 91% of JadiCell treated patients survived whereas only 42% of patients in the placebo group survived. There were no adverse effects associated with JadiCell administration. For those treated with the JadiCell under the age of 85 the survival rate was 100% and in those over 85 the survival rate was 91% making the JadiCell the most effective therapy to date in the entire world to treat ARDS.
 
The JadiCell product, which belongs to the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) family of cells, is a unique adult stem cell, which produces higher levels of therapeutic factors compared to other stem cells. The cells have demonstrated safety in animal models and pilot human trials. The Jadi Cell product is generated from umbilical cords, which are a source of medical waste and available in large quantities at inexpensive prices.
 
Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is caused by repetitive concussive/sub-concussive hits to the head sustained over a period of years and is often found in football players. The condition is characterized by memory loss, impulsive/erratic behavior, impaired judgment, aggression, depression, and dementia. In many patients with CTE, it is anatomically characterized by brain atrophy, reduced mass of frontal and temporal cortices, and medial temporal lobe.
 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an insult to the brain, not of a degenerative or congenital nature, but caused by external physical force that may produce a diminished or altered state of consciousness, which results in an impairment of cognitive abilities or physical functioning.
 
CTE represents a significant unmet medical need which we believe is amenable to stem cell intervention. We are eager to accelerate treatments and potential cures for debilitating conditions such as CTE and traumatic brain injury and plan to leverage New regulatory pathways such as the recently approved “Right to Try” Law to deliver these medicines as soon as possible to patients which currently have no other options.
 
The JadiCell product because of its advanced stage of development in contrast to other stem cell types, which require years, if not decades of development before entry into American patients, will allow us we believe to be treating patients within 12 months. Currently means of isolating, producing, scaling up, and delivery of the cells has all been worked out by Jadi Cell and Collaborators.

COPD possesses several features making it ideal for stem cell-based interventions: a) the quality of life and lack of progress demands the ethical exploration of novel approaches. For example, bone marrow stem cells have been used in over a thousand cardiac patients with some indication of efficacy. Adipose-based stem cell therapies have been successfully used in thousands of race-horses and companion animals without adverse effects, as well as numerous clinical trials are ongoing and published human data reports no adverse effects.
 
Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are potent immunomodulatory cells that recognize sites of injury, limit effector T cell reactions, and stimulate regulatory cell populations (i.e., T-regs) via growth factors, cytokines, and other mediators. Simultaneously, MSCs also stimulate local tissue regeneration via paracrine effects inducing angiogenic, anti-fibrotic and remodeling responses. Consequently, MSCs-based therapy represents a viable treatment option for autoimmune conditions and other inflammatory disorders, yielding beneficial effects in models of autoimmune Type 1 Diabetes, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis, Multiple Sclerosis, cardiac insufficiency, and organ transplantation. MSCs have been reported to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs, have shown safety in clinical trials for ARDS, and have been recently suggested as useful to treat patients with severe COVID-19 based on their effects preventing or attenuating the immunopathogenic cytokine storm.
 
Unfortunately, evaluation of stem cell therapy in COPD has lagged behind other areas of regenerative investigation; b) the underlying cause of COPD appears to be inflammatory and/or immunologically mediated. The destruction of alveolar tissue is associated with T cell reactivity, pathological pulmonary macrophage activation, and auto-antibody production. Mesenchymal stem cells have been demonstrated to potently suppress autoreactive T cells, inhibit macrophage activation, and autoantibody responses. Additionally, mesenchymal stem cells can be purified in high concentrations from adipose stromal vascular tissue together with high concentrations of T regulatory cells, which in animal models are approximately 100 times more potent than peripheral T cells at secreting cytokines therapeutic for COPD such as IL-10. Additionally, use of adipose derived cells has yielded promising clinical results in autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis; and c) Pulmonary stem cells capable of regenerating damaged parenchymal tissue have been reported. Administration of mesenchymal stem cells into neonatal oxygen-damaged lungs, which results in COPD-like alveoli dysplasia, has been demonstrated to yield improvements in two recent publications.
 
Based on the above rationale for stem cell-based COPD treatments, we are proposing a 10 patient Phase I safety trial to assess ability of JadiCell, a type of umbilical cord derived stem cells to improve objective and quality of life parameters in patients with moderate to severe COPD.
 
MSCs can be derived in large number from the Umbilical Cord (UC). JadiCells are a type of UC-MSCs, which can be utilized in the allogeneic setting and have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials for a number of disease conditions including inflammatory and immune-based diseases. UC-MSCs have been shown to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis in the lungs.
 
JadiCell UC-MSCs have been utilized to treat patients with severe COVID-19 and have yielded promising results, preventing, or attenuating the cytokine storm. JadiCells have been recently introduced intravenously in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder and have been approved for testing in patients with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). We hypothesize that JadiCells will exert beneficial therapeutic effects in COPD.
 
Breast Cancer Immunotherapy
 
Recently the Company announced the formation of a Spin-Off Company, Res Nova Bio, Inc., dedicated to the development of cancer inhibiting anti-angiogenesis immunotherapies. Res Nova Bio has licensed from Therapeutic Solutions International intellectual property covering StemVacs-V which is our iPSC derived platform technology announced in May of 2021. The technology utilizes pluripotent stem cells called iPSCs in order to generate new cells which resemble tumor blood vessels that are made to act as a “therapeutic vaccine”. Specifically, the administration of StemVacs-V stimulates the immune system to selectively kill blood vessels that feed the tumor but not healthy blood vessels. It is believed that for every 1 tumor blood vessel cell that is killed, 200-300 tumor cells are also killed as a result.
 
In addition to the license, the Company has transferred ownership of the IND titled “Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer by StemVacs-V Cancer Immunotherapeutic” to Res Nova Bio with the primary objective being safety and feasibility of StemVacs-V administration at 12 months as assessed by lack of adverse medical events. The secondary objective is efficacy as judged by tumor response, time to progression, and immunological monitoring.
 
Cellular Manufacturing and Cell Banking
 
On October 18, 2021, the Company announced the formation of Allogen Biologics Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of TSOI. Allogen Biologics will house intellectual property and Standard Operating Procedures related to generation of the Company’s existing and anticipated cellular therapeutics. In addition, Allogen will house and maintain all relevant cell banks.
On May 10, 2022, Allogen Biologic, Inc, and Therapeutic Solutions International Inc, entered into an Exclusive Patent License Agreement (EPLA) for Patent Application Serial No. 63/254,469, filed by Licensor and titled as: Umbilical Cord Derived Regenerative and Immune Modulatory Stem Cell Populations.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
The Company’s business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the United States, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The Company will be subject to additional agencies and regulations if it enters the manufacturing business. Various agencies of the state and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business, such as the California Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. The areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others:

● | product claims and advertising; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | product labels; 
● | product ingredients; and 
● | how we package, distribute, import, export, sell and store our products. 

 
The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution and sale of vitamins and other nutritional supplements in the United States, while the FTC regulates marketing and advertising claims. The FDA issued a final rule called “Statements Made for Dietary Supplements Concerning the Effect of the Product on the Structure or Function of the Body,” which includes regulations requiring companies, their suppliers and manufacturers to meet Good Manufacturing Practices in the preparation, packaging, storage and shipment of their products. Management is committed to meeting or exceeding the standards set by the FDA.
 
The FDA has also issued regulations governing the labeling and marketing of dietary and nutritional supplement products. They include:
 

● | the identification of dietary or nutritional supplements and their nutrition and ingredient labeling; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support; 
● | labeling requirements for dietary or nutritional supplements for which “high potency” and “antioxidant” claims are made; 
● | notification procedures for statements on dietary and nutritional supplements; and 
● | pre-market notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements. 

 
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) revised the existing provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements and defined dietary supplements to include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. The FDA is generally prohibited from regulating active ingredients in dietary supplements as drugs unless product claims, such as claims that a product may heal, mitigate, cure or prevent an illness, disease or malady, trigger drug status.
 
The Company is also subject to a variety of other regulations in the United States, including those relating to taxes, labor and employment, import and export, and intellectual property.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had three full-time employees, all non-union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
 
COMPETITION
 
The bio-technology, bio-pharma, and nutraceutical industries are subject to rapid technological change. Competition from domestic and foreign companies, large pharmaceutical companies and other interested businesses is intense and expected to increase. A number of companies with significantly greater resources are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals, biologics, and nutraceuticals in our targeted areas.
