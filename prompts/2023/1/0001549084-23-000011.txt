Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We design, develop, and market exoskeleton products that augment human strength, endurance and mobility. Our exoskeleton technology serves multiple markets and can be utilized both by able-bodied persons and persons with physical disabilities. We have marketed devices that (i) enable individuals with neurological conditions affecting gait, including acquired brain injury (ABI) and spinal cord injury (SCI), to rehabilitate, and in some cases, to walk again, (ii) provide ambulation assistance in home and community settings for individuals with certain SCI levels, (iii) assist individuals with a broad range of upper extremity impairments, and (iv) allow industrial workers to perform difficult repetitive work for extended periods.
We believe that the commercial opportunity for exoskeleton technology adoption is accelerating as a result of recent advancements in material technologies, electronic and electrical engineering, control technologies, and sensor and software development. Taken individually, many of these advancements have become ubiquitous in peoples’ everyday lives. We believe that we have learned how to integrate these existing technologies and wrap the result around a human being efficiently, elegantly, and safely, supported by an industry leading intellectual property portfolio. We further believe that we can do so across a broad spectrum of applications, from persons with lower limb paralysis to able-bodied users.
On December 5, 2022, we acquired the Human Motion and Control (“HMC”) Business Unit from Parker Hannifin Corporation (“Parker”), an Ohio corporation (the "HMC Acquisition"). The assets acquired from the business unit include intellectual property rights for devices which are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared lower-limb powered exoskeletons that enable task-specific, overground gait training to patients with weakness or paralysis in their lower extremities. The HMC acquisition has the potential to fuel growth by increasing top line revenue and expanding our reach throughout the continuum of care.
We continue to explore business development initiatives to fuel growth and long-term value and are committed to helping people improve mobility and live healthier lives through combining the use of technology with advanced rehabilitative programs. 
For medical applications we have three main products.
•EksoNR is a robotic exoskeleton specifically designed to be used in a rehabilitation setting to progress neurorehab patients so they can walk out of the device and back into their communities. As an exoskeleton FDA-cleared for acquired brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS) and spinal cord injury, EksoNR offers what we believe is the industry’s most natural gait, re-teaching the brain and muscles how to properly walk again. 
•Ekso Indego Therapy is a modular, adjustable, lightweight, lower-limb powered exoskeleton that can be custom-sized and fitted to patients for use in rehabilitation and wellness applications. Ekso Indego Therapy is cleared by the FDA for use with stroke and SCI patients.
•Ekso Indego Personal is a lightweight powered lower limb orthosis that enables people with mobility impairments the opportunity to walk independently. Ekso Indego Personal is cleared by the FDA for use with SCI patients with injury levels from T3 to L5 in community or home settings.
For able-bodied industrial workers, we have offered three products.
•Ekso EVO, a wearable exoskeleton for overhead work. EVO is an upper body exoskeleton that elevates and supports a worker's arms to assist them with tasks from chest height to overhead. EVO is intended to reduce worker fatigue and reduce on-site injuries while boosting productivity. Based on extensive customer feedback, we have engineered EVO to be light weight, have a low profile, allow for minimal contact with the body, and offer a wide range of uninhibited arm motion. EVO is currently targeted at vertical markets including aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, and specific construction trades.
•EksoVest is the predecessor product to EVO and has similar properties and applications. EksoVest was discontinued in 2022.
•EksoZeroG is a mobile tool support arm that can be mounted on a fixed structure to reduce the load transferred from the tool to the user. EksoZeroG is used primarily in construction and demolition applications. EksoZeroG was discontinued in 2022.
EksoHealth - Rehabilitation
Today, we focus our healthcare business on advanced technology in the rehabilitation market. We are leveraging our patented exoskeleton technology to develop and market products intended to rehabilitate patients earlier and with better outcomes than the current standard of care.
As of December 31, 2022, we had shipped approximately 620 EksoNR and EksoGT units combined to over 400 rehabilitation facilities or customers worldwide. The number of units utilized at a facility varies from one to seven, and is driven by the number of beds and rehabilitation sessions a hospital can offer and that hospital’s adoption of robotics within its rehabilitation protocols. As of December 31, 2022, more than 300 Ekso Indego Therapy and Personal devices have been shipped to over 220 clinical centers or personal end users. The number of units at a center may vary for clinical sites based on the size of the site and ability to assist multiple patients simultaneously using Ekso Indego. Some sites that purchased Ekso Indego technology prior to the release of Ekso Indego Therapy received a 3-piece kit of Indego devices, one each of small/short, medium, and large/tall size configurations. 
EksoNR
EksoNR is a wearable bionic exoskeleton that allows hospitals and other rehabilitation providers to deliver over ground gait therapy and ambulation assistance. EksoNR incorporates hardware and software that can provide varying levels of support and assistance to the patient in real-time, correct issues with the patient’s reciprocal gait. Patients receive therapy in the device under the supervision of a physical therapist, and typically use an additional assistive device such as a cane, crutches or a walker. Walking is achieved by a user shifting their weight, requiring the user to achieve balance thereby replicating and reinforcing the movements of a natural gait. Using built-in software, EksoNR's sensors can detect weight shift and initiate steps. Battery-powered motors drive the legs with software determining the appropriate level of assistance necessary for a user to complete the gait sequence. 
EksoNR is used by customers in both in-patient and out-patient settings. Our customers believe that for patients with some preserved motor ability (for example, after a stroke, an ABI, or an incomplete SCI), EksoNR offers unique benefits. It helps therapists teach proper gait patterns and weight shifts, allowing some patients to potentially mobilize earlier and ultimately to walk again. By allowing individuals to stand and walk in a full weight-bearing setting, early clinical evidence is beginning to show that EksoNR may offer potential healthcare benefits (inclusive of patients with complete SCIs). These benefits include a reduction in secondary complications such as pressure sores, urinary tract infections, bowel problems, pneumonia and other respiratory issues, bone loss/osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and psychological disorders resulting in reduced post-injury medical costs.
EksoNR includes cloud connectivity through EksoPulse, which gathers and transmits statistics and device information during EksoNR walking sessions. This information can be used to track patient progression and to monitor device utilization. Data is sent securely to the cloud where it is available for customers to view, filter, and export through a secure web portal. This feature enables more thorough patient care while reducing manual data entry. It also enables us to provide a higher level of service through early identification and thorough reporting of device errors, saving customers the time and expense of unnecessary on-site visits.
Ekso Indego Therapy
Ekso Indego Therapy is an adjustable, lower-limb powered exoskeleton that can be custom-sized and tailor fitted to patients allowing for swift donning. A comprehensive software suite further enhances training sessions by providing a variety of options, settings, and analytics on patient and device performance that therapists can use to improve treatment plans in real-time. The Ekso Indego Therapy enables therapists to deliver task specific, over-ground and individualized gait training.
Ekso Indego Therapy enables individualized gait therapy for patients with lower extremity weakness or paralysis (such as complete/incomplete spinal cord injury and stroke). Ekso Indego's lightweight, modular, and quick-adjust design allows clinicians to offer intensive gait therapy, custom-tailored to patients across the entire continuum of care from inpatient facilities to in-home sessions and everything in between.
Ekso Indego Therapy+ software is designed to provide effective gait therapy for patients with lower extremity weakness, such as partially impaired stroke survivors. Patients are required to initiate leg movement and Ekso Indego provides support when necessary while providing auditory, real-time feedback.
Ekso Indego Motion+ software allows clinicians to practice task-specific gait therapy with patients through a predictable, guided gait pattern. Powerful motors in the hip and knee, customizable within the Ekso Indego app, enable patients with little to 
no gait function to stand and walk with postural controls. The patient leans forward to initiate movement, and Ekso Indego responds accordingly
Ekso Indego Personal
Ekso Indego Personal is a powered lower limb orthosis, also known as a powered exoskeleton, which enables people with mobility impairments the opportunity to walk independently. Power is provided by sophisticated motors in the knee and hip joints, and combined with advanced sensors and control strategies, the device allows gait impaired individuals to stand and walk again, granting them a new level of independence at home and in the community.
Ekso Indego Personal offers a modular quick connect design, which allows its users to put on and take off the device without assistance. At just 29 lb (13 kg), Ekso Indego Personal is a lightweight commercial exoskeleton offering ease of handling, transportation, and storage.
Ekso Indego Personal can currently be used with spinal cord injury levels of T3 to L5 in community or home settings, but is not intended for sports or stair climbing.
With its slim profile, Ekso Indego Personal offers a modular quick-connect design, which allows users to put on and take off the device without assistance even while seated in most standard-frame wheelchairs. It is compatible with stability aids such as rolling walkers or forearm crutches. With no backpack or exposed wiring, Ekso Indego Personal allows for safe use in most home and community environments and on surfaces like pavement, grass, carpet and tile. 
Market Overview

Rehabilitation clinics with significant stroke, ABI, and SCI populations comprise the primary market for our medical products. Due to their chronic nature, we believe that these conditions have an enormous clinical and economic impact on both people with the conditions and the healthcare system. According to the Centers for Disease Control, there are approximately 800,000 strokes suffered per year in the U.S. and approximately 15 million worldwide, making stroke rehabilitation our largest target market. Likewise, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, there are approximately 18,000 incidences of SCI per year in the U.S., and according to the World Health Organization, between 250,000 to 500,000 incidences worldwide. 
We also serve individual users with Ekso Indego Personal, which is intended to provide overground ambulation in community and home settings. The primary use case for Ekso Indego Personal is for users with certain spinal cord injuries. For this patient population, confinement to a wheelchair can cause severe physical and psychological deterioration. As a result, the secondary medical consequences of paralysis can include difficulty with bowel and urinary tract function, osteoporosis, loss of lean mass, gain in fat mass, insulin resistance, diabetes, and heart disease. The cost of treating these conditions is substantial.
A particular subset of the SCI population that we address with Ekso Indego Therapy are U.S. veterans treated by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the "VA"). According to VA data there are approximately 42,000 of such patients are veterans and are eligible for medical care and other benefits from the VA out of which 27,000 are receiving treatment annually. With 25 VA spinal cord injury centers, the VA has the largest single network of spinal cord injury care in the United States. 
The European Union includes a unique approach to market penetration and subsequent coverage, requiring separate claims for purchasing the device and for requests for reimbursement. We are well represented in clinics run by German and Austrian accident insurers, with four out of nine rehabilitation sites in Germany, and four out of four rehabilitation sites in Austria. We operate out-patient rehabilitation sessions paid for by the accident insurer, where patients train using our devices in rehabilitation setting. We are using these examples to integrate exoskeletal therapy in existing care pathways as well as to pursue personal device sales.
While the market opportunity for robotic exoskeleton rehabilitation may be large, we also recognize that the path for medical devices to become the standard of care is long and challenging. We believe that our ability to accelerate adoption will also be based, in part, on our ability to build on our partners’ early efforts to: (i) expand clinical evidence and (ii) drive toward standard of care. We are already seeing customers use our products with patients post stroke, ABI, SCI, or MS to facilitate the recommended amount of rehabilitation per guidelines defined by the American Heart Association. All of our lower extremity products have the versatility to provide an over-ground gait training intervention that is task-specific, high intensity and patient-centered throughout the continuum of care.
Clinical Evidence
Many of our early clinical customers have participated in research focusing on safety and feasibility of exoskeletons and robotics in rehabilitation market development. These early studies were favorable and have further developed to focus on efficacy, outcomes, dosage, and comparing this technology to other therapeutic interventions. Currently, a search for “robotic exoskeleton” on PubMed, a search engine for biomedical literature and life science journal articles, garners approximately 289 unique publications on the topic. The Ekso exoskeletons (Ekso1.1, EksoGT, EksoNR, and Ekso Indego) have been utilized in many of these protocols. The body of research has been carried out by world-renowned institutions and examines a wide variety of diagnoses including ABI, SCI, stroke, MS, and others. The findings of this research are overall positive and promote use of an Ekso exoskeleton in rehabilitation to provide patient outcomes that are equal to or superior to traditional physical therapy in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. Some of these outcomes include faster gait speed, increased gait endurance, improvements in cardiometabolic responses, enhanced quality of life, more typical gait kinematics, and increased function. More recent research has focused on session duration and demonstrates that patients are able to complete significantly greater numbers of steps using an Ekso exoskeleton than in traditional therapy. This is important because the number of repetitions required to master a skill is high, so being able to utilize this equipment to get more intense practice will lead to improved outcomes.
Economic Value Proposition
We believe that our EksoNR allows our customers to benefit economically without modifying the reimbursement model or reimbursement codes. First, many of our customers have reported that utilizing the EksoNR promotes continuous patient improvement beginning sooner than with traditional rehabilitation methods, potentially leading to a commensurate increase in insurance reimbursements. Second, many of our customers report that facilities equipped with the EksoNR as part of their rehabilitation programs attract more patients, thereby driving positive economic benefits. Lastly, we believe that improvements in patient outcomes, such as those seen with the use of EksoNR, translate positively to other metrics including discharge to community, staffing efficiency in the rehabilitation unit, and reductions in readmission rates.
Ekso Indego Personal addresses the home and community use market for patients with specific spinal cord injuries—further extending the continuum of care beyond the rehabilitation or clinical setting. Today the primary source of revenue for Ekso Indego Personal is from the VA, who purchases devices on behalf of veterans who qualify. Since 2015 the VA has supported coverage for US qualified veterans who have suffered spinal cord injury & further expanded the program in 2018 to support more convenient training options that are closer to patients’ homes. As the industry continues to work to extend Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services codes for reimbursement through traditional means the market opportunity will expand. 
Today, in the United States wearable at home assisted exoskeleton medical technology is generally not covered for reimbursement by private insurance providers. However, reimbursement may be approved on a case-by-case basis as in the case of workers compensation or accident settlements. In some instances, devices are paid for by individual users from their own personal funds or through charitable donations or organizations.
Additional future commercial opportunities are possible but require more traditional programs for adequate coverage for potential partial or full reimbursement from third party payors, which may include; private health insurance companies, managed care, and government facilities (such as Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States).
Current Sales and Marketing Efforts
Our key marketing goal today is the broad-based commercial adoption of our portfolio of robotic wearable exoskeletons, including the EksoNR, Ekso Indego Therapy and the Ekso Indego Personal, in the Hospital and Home setting. We are focusing our go-to-market protocols and collateral on our three target audiences: medical administrators, medical directors/ therapists, and patients. Working closely with thought leaders, we will continue to build upon our early user-group exchanges, develop clinical education programs, and grow our medical advisory council.
There continues to be high market interest in expanding neurosciences service lines. In alignment with this interest, our sales priority involves the education of clinical and executive stakeholders on the economic and clinical value of our robotic exoskeleton portfolio, including the EksoNR and the Ekso Indego Therapy devices. In tandem, we continue to leverage our EksoNR and Ekso Indego customer base to educate and mentor strategic target centers that specialize in stroke, ABI and SCI rehabilitation in specific geographies. Geographically, the priorities have been the U.S. in the Americas, Germany in EMEA (the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region), and Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia in APAC (the Asia Pacific region). Currently, we utilize a direct sales force for customers located in the U.S., Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, Germany, Austria and Switzerland. We also have an expanding distributor network in EMEA and APAC.
The sales and marketing team is principally based in the U.S., Germany, and Singapore, and is structured as follows:
•One commercial leader each for the Americas, EMEA, and APAC;
•Americas, EMEA, and APAC sales professionals who pursue new prospects and organize demonstrations;
•Clinical professionals and physical therapists who provide peer-to-peer demonstrations and trainings;
•Marketing professionals and consultants who build awareness and generate demand; and
•Ambassadors, who are stroke and SCI survivors, who provide demonstrations and personal experiences.
The sales cycle for the EksoNR and Ekso Indego Therapy devices average approximately eight to 12 months for a first device and six to eight months for subsequent devices. The typical sale of our EksoNR and Ekso Indego Therapy is a complete package, which includes the device and all relevant components, batteries for continuous run-time, training and certification. Customers also typically purchase Ekso Care, which is our one- to four-year after-sales service package.
For products sold to hospitals or other rehabilitation clinics, we offer a range of purchase options. In most cases and when capital is available, the product is sold outright to the customer as a capital sale and the full price is invoiced to the customer after title transfers. For customers who prefer to finance the purchase of their device, we have finance partners who facilitate such transactions. Often these arrangements will be marketed as a subscription offer to the end customer. Typically, in a subscription arrangement we will sell the device to the 3rd party financing partner who then contracts with the end customer for payment terms. In some subscription cases we may elect to maintain ownership of the product provided to the customer in lieu of selling it to a 3rd party financing partner. 
Rehabilitation treatments that can benefit from the use of our EksoNR and Ekso Indego Therapy products take place in a range of different types of facilities. These include inpatient rehab facilities (IRF), long term acute care hospitals (LTACH), skilled nursing facilities (SNF), and outpatient rehab clinics, among others. The primary facility types we currently serve are IRFs. Among these facilities, ownership structures also vary from small independent rehab centers to larger networks of providers. Our current market focus is on the larger network providers, referred to as integrated delivery networks (IDN). Sales to IDNs typically involve multi-unit transactions that can benefit from lower selling costs, better pipeline visibility, and better economies of scale. In 2022, approximately 54% of our new unit shipments for EksoNR were to IDNs, and globally, multi-unit sales comprised approximately 61% of our unit shipments.
The sales cycle for the Ekso Indego Personal device averages 8-12 months from the first interaction we have with the potential Personal user. The Ekso Indego Personal device is regulated by the FDA and the patient must have an injury level of T3 to L5 and have a support person when utilizing the device. The majority of Personal users will be Veterans, as we work closely with VA hospitals located throughout the county. The Veteran will need to complete a screening, in-clinic training and a home trial prior to the VA purchasing the device for the Veteran. 
We sell our medical products through a combination of direct and indirect (i.e., distribution) channels. In the US, our hospital and clinical sales are primarily made through our direct salesforce, with the exception of sales to the VA which are handled through distribution. In EMEA, we sell through a combination of direct and indirect channels, with DACH countries typically handled direct, and other countries and regions served through distributors. In APAC we also use a combination of direct and indirect channels depending on the country.
Clinical Services and Customer Success
We have developed a leading clinical capability in robotic rehabilitation, and we provide extensive training and support to our customers to ensure they are successful. All sales or subscriptions include customer training. This is comprised of both online and in-person training of our customers’ physical therapists. We have made this a high priority as we recognize getting customers comfortable using our product is a prerequisite to them successfully implementing a robotic rehabilitation program.
Product Pipeline
As described previously, our current medical products broadly target the rehabilitation and mobility spaces. We believe there are further opportunities in these and adjacent use cases, and we plan to expand our product portfolio accordingly. Our internal medical product development activities are targeted at a combination of next generation versions of our current products as well as new applications in both rehabilitation and mobility. 
In addition to our internal development activities, we are continuously evaluating complementary external products and services that have the potential to leverage our existing infrastructure and go-to-market capacity to further expand our industry presence. This includes the possibility of pursuing business relationships ranging from acquisitions to licensing activities. 
EksoWorks - Able-Bodied Industrial Applications
We continue to pursue market and product development opportunities for able-bodied industrial applications. Injuries caused by repetitive tasks and overexertion are leading causes of lost work days due to workplace injuries. Ekso Bionics believes that human augmentation and exoskeletons in particular have a key role to play in solving these workplace issues and strives to alleviate the burden on skilled workers, to drastically reduce the number of workplace injuries, and to cut down on worker fatigue. 
Our primary product for able-bodied industrial applications is EVO, an upper body exoskeleton that elevates and supports a worker's arms to assist them with tasks ranging from chest height to overhead. EVO builds on nearly a decade of design and development history in upper extremity applications and is based on extensive customer feedback. EVO is a passive, spring-loaded assistive upper-body exoskeleton that is designed to reduce fatigue and shoulder and back muscle strain, with the goal of eliminating work-related injuries to the neck, shoulder, and back. EVO offers five to fifteen pounds of lift assistance in each arm to elevate and alleviate the day-to-day strain on workers across all industries. While EVO is a general purpose product, we currently target specific vertical markets including aerospace, automotive, general manufacturing, and some construction trades.
EksoVest is a shoulder support product targeted at overhead work. EksoVest was superseded by EVO upon its release. We continued to produce EksoVest and associated accessories for existing customers in 2022. EksoVest was discontinued at the end of 2022.
EksoZeroG is a tool holder that can mount on an aerial lift platform or scaffolding. This effectively reduces the weight of heavy tools as felt by the operator. EksoZeroG has been sold primarily through rental companies into the construction market. EksoZeroG was discontinued in 2022.
Market feedback continues to indicate a growing imperative among construction and manufacturing companies to drive adoption of improved safety and health practices. Furthermore, based on initial field-testing and market research, we believe that industrial exoskeletons have the potential to help prevent workforce injuries, improve productivity and over time reduce workers’ compensation and related costs. In the U.S. alone, our target manufacturing and construction verticals employ a total of 18.4 million workers (according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), many of whom can potentially benefit from our assistive technology.
In addition, human augmentation technology is being viewed by senior managers of companies that have participated in field-testing as an opportunity to extend the careers of experienced and skilled workers while also changing the work environment to attract future workers to these careers.
While we believe that the evidence clearly demonstrates that there is significant demand for human augmentation in industrial applications, adoption rates remain a challenge due to the nascent nature of the technology. That said, we believe that there is significant mid-to-long-term potential in the industrial markets, and accordingly, we will continue our product development efforts to expand our EksoWorks product offerings. Given the fragmented nature of the industrial market we believe that the best approach in this market involves collaboration with established strategic partners who can help us target applications tailored for specific use cases. We believe that leveraging our extensive exoskeleton expertise and intellectual property portfolio with the established channel and applying the expertise of one or more strategic partners will unlock the highest value for us and our stockholders. We continue to engage with multiple potential industrial partners, and plan to continue this approach going forward.
Manufacturing and Service
After Sales Service
Maintenance and service support, primarily provided under the Ekso Care program for the EksoNR or extended warranty program for Ekso Indego, helps to maximize operational efficiency for our customers and reduces unplanned equipment downtime. We provide direct service for our customers’ devices at our facilities in San Rafael, California, Macedonia, Ohio and Ratingen, Germany. For some customers in EMEA and APAC, we utilize third-party service providers. Our team consists of service technicians, who perform repairs at our facilities or onsite as required and provide remote technical support, and customer care agents who resolve and troubleshoot issues that could inhibit optimal customer utilization.  Beyond our extended warranty and Ekso Care service programs, we provide a fee-for-service option through which device repairs are fulfilled per quote on demand of the customer and as per our repair price list.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain 
We currently manufacture our EksoNR and EVO products at our facilities in San Rafael, California for worldwide sales. Our Ekso Indego Therapy and Ekso Indego Personal devices are manufactured at our facilities in Macedonia, Ohio. We currently run one shift per day at both facilities and believe we have the capacity to eventually run additional shifts should we deem it appropriate. 
In addition to our in-house manufacturing capabilities, we are in the process of adding contract manufacturing partners for both EksoNR and EVO. In 2022, we completed the process of transferring sufficient technology and know-how to build EksoNR at a domestic contract manufacturing partner. For the full year of 2022, contract manufacturing represented approximately 20% of our production output for EksoNR. We expect the share of contracted manufacturing production for EksoNR to expand further in 2023.
Starting in 2022, we also began the process of adding external manufacturing capability for our EVO product line at a contract manufacturing partner located in Malaysia. We believe that manufacturing EVO at a contract manufacturing partner will help us to expand capacity, lower cost, and improve quality. We expect this process to be completed in the first half of 2023. For 2023, we expect the majority of our manufacturing output for EVO to be provided by this contract manufacturing partner.
We purchase both custom and off-the-shelf components from a large number of suppliers and subject them to stringent quality specifications and processes. Whenever possible, we seek to secure dual source suppliers for our components. Some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by single-sourced suppliers (the only approved supply source for us among other sources). We purchase the majority of our components and major assemblies through purchase orders rather than long-term supply agreements and generally do not maintain finished goods in excess of our anticipated demand. We currently support our domestic contract manufacturing partner in the procurement of raw materials for EksoNR.
Intellectual Property
We have established an extensive intellectual property portfolio that includes various U.S. patents and patent applications. The table below provides a summary of U.S. patents by issuing status and ownership status as of December 31, 2022.

Pending applications mean a complete application has been filed with the applicable patent authority and additional action is pending. 
Many of these applications have also been filed internationally as appropriate for their respective subject matter. As of December 31, 2022, 299 applications have issued or have been allowed as patents internationally. Our patent portfolio contains 334 cases that have issued or are in prosecution in 21 countries outside the U.S.
Our patent portfolio includes product and method type claims, since the devices that we produce and the processes performed by those devices are patentable. Our patents encompass technologies relevant to our devices, including medical exoskeletons, commercial exoskeletons, actuators, and strength-enhancing exoskeletons. The earliest priority date of the portfolio reaches back to 2003, and new applications may continue to be filed from time-to-time.
Licensors include the Regents of the University of California, or UC Berkeley, and Vanderbilt University.
The license with UC Berkeley consists of two agreements and one amendment to the agreement covering ten patent cases exclusively licensed to us, nine of which have issued and one of which remains in prosecution, or the UC Berkeley License Agreements. Inventions covered by a further three patent applications are co-owned by us and UC Berkeley, with no license agreement between us and UC Berkeley. As a result, UC Berkeley may license its rights in these patents to a third party. With respect to two of these co-owned patent applications, UC Berkeley has licensed their rights in the U.S. to an unrelated third party. The third patent application will need to be fully prosecuted before it can be determined which claims are exclusive to us (through a previous license) and which claims UC Berkeley may license to other entities.
Pursuant to the UC Berkeley License Agreements, Ekso Bionics initially paid UC Berkeley consideration consisting of $5,000 in cash and 310,400 common shares of Ekso Bionics, and committed to pay a 1% royalty on sales, including sales generated by sublicenses. In addition, the UC Berkeley License Agreements call for minimum annual payments of $50,000. We do not pay royalties to UC Berkeley on products sold or to be resold to the U.S. government.
As part of the HMC acquisition, Ekso acquired and assumed certain intangible assets including license agreements with Vanderbilt University. 
On October 15, 2012, PH entered a license agreement (“Exoskeleton License Agreement”) with Vanderbilt University and was granted exclusive license within the HMC field of use to specific licensed patents and licensed software by paying a non-refundable, non-creditable license issue fee and running royalties. Subsequently, PH entered three amendments with Vanderbilt University and was granted license to additional patents and software from 2014 to 2019 by paying license issue fee and running royalties. The royalties were set to be calculated at 6% of Net Sales for Licensed Patent Products (or a minimum of $250,000) and 3% of Net Sales for Licensed Software products.
On March 1, 2022, Parker Hannifin Corporation entered a license agreement (“P-H Knee License Agreement”) with Vanderbilt University and was granted exclusive license to specific licensed patents, licensed software and copyrightable technical information by paying a non-refundable, non-creditable license issue fee and running royalties. Included in this agreement was the right to sublicense beginning in March 2024. We will pay Vanderbilt $100,000 as the second of two payments due April 30, 2023. In addition, royalties were set to be calculated at 3.75% of net sales of the licensed product. Beginning July 1, 2027, minimum annual royalties will be set at $75,000 (for the 12 month period through June 30, 2028) and $100,000 for each 12 month period thereafter. 
In addition to the aforementioned agreements, various other subsidized research and development agreements have been entered into with Vanderbilt covering specific work product as articulated in those documents.
In some cases, as a result of government funding we receive, our patents have a government use license, granting the U.S. government a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license for use of the inventions for or on behalf of the U.S. government, as is typical in the case of government sponsored research.
Under a license agreement with the developer of certain intellectual property related to mechanical balance and support arm technologies, which grants the Company an exclusive license with respect to the technology and patent rights for certain fields of use, the Company is required to pay the developer a single-digit royalty on net receipts, subject to a $50,000 annual minimum royalty requirement. The license agreement with this developer was terminated as of June 30, 2022.
In addition, the Company entered into a license agreement in December of 2021 with a third party that develops technologies having utility in robotic exoskeletons from research and development activities associated with a specific set of government funded research projects. Commencing in January 2022, the Company assists with research and development activities in exchange for access to a worldwide, royalty free, transferable, sublicensable, exclusive license to design and market products that use or incorporate the jointly-developed technology within Ekso’s target market segments.
Intellectual Property Out-Licensing
In March 2018, we entered into a set of agreements with Daydo Co, Ltd., or Daydo, related to distribution and cross-licensing of the EksoVest. Under these agreements, Daydo has exclusive distribution rights for the EksoVest within Japan and rights to modify the EksoVest as needed to address the Japanese market in exchange for royalty payments to us. We also have rights to use any improvements made by Daydo. Daydo released its localized version of the EksoVest (called Task AR) in January of 2019. These agreements were terminated in 2022, resulting in the recognition of all deferred prepaid royalty revenue. 
In June 2020, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with HAWE Hydraulik of Germany for rights to develop hydraulic pumps covered by a family of our patents. The agreement additionally includes an exclusivity option. We did not receive any royalty revenue from this license in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The medical technology and industrial robotics industries are characterized by intense competition and rapid technological change. We believe that a number of other companies are developing competitive technology and devices for both the able-bodied and medical fields of use.
In the medical field, we face competition from companies that are focused on technology for rehabilitation of patients suffering from stroke and related neurological disabilities as well as from companies that are focused on SCI. In stroke, Cyberdyne, ReWalk, Wandercraft, and ExoAtlet offer ambulatory exoskeletons for varying use cases within the rehabilitation markets where we operate. While not functionally equivalent, Hocoma, AlterG, Aretech and Reha Technology sell end-effector or treadmill-based gait therapies. Other companies that have announced plans to commercialize robotic exoskeletons include Bionik Laboratories and SuitX.
The EksoNR device is the only FDA-cleared device for SCI, ABI (including stroke), and MS. Technologies developed by competitors in the areas of stroke rehabilitation and SCI represent therapeutic interventions with utility at varying points on the continuum of care. Clinically, the EksoNR is unique in its broad ability to mobilize pre- or even non-ambulatory patients using a full weight bearing, over ground, task-based platform. From a practice management perspective, the EksoNR is less expensive than many other systems, has a smaller footprint, has the ability to move around the hospital, and uses standard power requirements that make it easy to integrate into existing infrastructure. Other over-ground exoskeletons were initially designed for an individual to achieve ambulation reliant on the device. By contrast, the EksoNR’s design accommodates patients with complete paraplegia and additionally includes features that are optimized to assist therapists in helping patients with some motor ability learn to walk again in a clinical setting, treating several patients and indications in a single day.
In the home and community ambulation use market ReWalk and Cyberdyne offer products that address similar use cases to Ekso Indego Personal in certain markets. We believe Ekso Indego Personal is a more robust and easier to use product than the competition. We also believe that given our strong position in rehabilitation clinics, we have a better channel to direct patients from clinical settings to our specific personal devices. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the most pressing challenges we face are not necessarily competitive technologies, but rather achieving rapid market awareness and adoption of this emerging technology while acclimating prospects to a fundamentally new paradigm in neuro-rehabilitation and mobility. In addition, it may be difficult for the rehabilitation department of a hospital or clinic to secure the funds to acquire Ekso devices in an environment where capital expenditures of this magnitude are not commonly incurred by those rehabilitation departments.
In the industrial business, there are multiple competitors with shoulder devices including products from Ottobock, Levitate, Skel-ex, and others. While these products all address similar use cases in overhead work, we believe that EVO provides a better solution. In particular EVO provides i) optionally more support for larger users and those using heavy tools, ii) a wider range of shoulder motion free of obstructions from the device, especially when reaching directly overhead, iii) a more rugged, durable design, and iv) minimal contact points with the body to reduce heat and sweat generation. 
Exoskeleton technology remains in its infancy. As this field develops, we believe that we will face increased competition on the basis of product features, clinical outcomes, price, services and other factors. Our competitive position will depend on multiple, complex factors, including our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement production and marketing plans, secure regulatory approvals for products under development and protect our intellectual property. In some instances, competitors may also offer, or may attempt to develop, alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device.
Governmental Regulation and Product Approval
U.S. Medical Device Regulation
The U.S. government regulates the medical device industry through various agencies, including but not limited to the FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). The design, testing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, distribution, advertising, and marketing of medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and local governmental authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries. Any medical device product that we develop must receive all requisite regulatory approvals or clearances, as the case may be, before it may be marketed in a particular country. 
Device development, marketing clearance and approval. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the extent of control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are deemed to pose the least risk and are subject only to general controls applicable to all devices, such as requirements for device labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice requirements, as reflected in its Quality System Regulation (QSR). Class II devices are intermediate risk devices that are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, and include life- sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, and devices not “substantially equivalent” to a device that is already legally marketed. Most Class I devices, and some Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the 510(k) clearance requirement and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. Class I and Class II devices that have not been so exempted are eligible for marketing through the 510(k) clearance pathway. By contrast, devices placed in Class III generally require premarket approval (PMA), prior to commercial marketing.
To obtain 510(k) clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification application to the FDA demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is typically a Class II device that is legally marketed in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if it has the same intended use and (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) has different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A showing of substantial equivalence sometimes, but not always, requires clinical data. Generally, the 510(k) clearance process can exceed 90 days and may extend to a year or more. After a device has received 510(k) clearance for a specific intended use, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, such as a significant change in the design, materials, method of manufacture or intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance, or if the device as modified is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device, a PMA. While the determination as to whether new authorization is needed is initially left to the manufacturer, the FDA may review this determination and evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may request the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
The second, more comprehensive, approval process applies to a new device that is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device or that is to be used in supporting or sustaining life or preventing impairment. These devices are normally Class III devices requiring PMA. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process takes substantially longer than the 510(k) process, taking approximately one to two years or more for approval.
In some instances, the FDA may find that a device is new and not substantially equivalent to a predicate device but is also not a high-risk device as is generally the case with Class III PMA devices. In these instances, the FDA may allow a device to be reclassified from Class III to Class I or II. The De Novo reclassification option is an alternate pathway to classify novel devices of low-to-moderate risk that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a “not substantially equivalent” (NSE) determination in response to a 510(k) notification. The FDA also allows a sponsor to submit a De Novo reclassification request to the FDA for novel low to moderate risk devices without first being required to submit a 510(k) application. These types of applications are referred to as “Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation” or “De Novo requests.” In instances where a device is deemed not substantially equivalent to a Class II predicate device, the candidate device may be filed as a De Novo application which may lengthen regulatory decisions by the FDA. FDA review of a De Novo application may lead the FDA to identify the device as either a Class I or II device and subject to or exempt from 510(k) premarket notification.
Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA or De Novo reclassification application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials generally require an investigational device exemption application (IDE), approved in advance 
by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board (IRB), for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. Conducting a clinical trial also requires obtaining the patients' informed consent in form and substance compliant with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The FDA or the IRB could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S. To date, the EksoNR and EksoGT have been the subject of several clinical studies, some sponsored by us, as well as non-Ekso-sponsored independent studies conducted by rehabilitation institutions.
Our current indications for use (IFU) clearance for ABI (including stroke), SCI, and MS. On April 1, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to market our EksoGT robotic exoskeleton for use in the treatment of individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke, individuals with SCI at levels T4 to L5, and individuals with SCI at levels of T3 to C7 (ASIA D), in accordance with the device’s labeling. On July 19, 2016, we received clearance from the FDA to expand/clarify the indications and labeling to expressly include individuals with hemiplegia due to stroke who have upper extremity function of at least 4 out of 5 strength in at least one arm. On August 25, 2019, our EksoNR device was introduced with the same IFU as EksoGT. On June 15, 2020, we received clearance from FDA to expand the indications for use, or IFU, and labeling to expressly include individuals with ABI, including traumatic brain injury and stroke who have upper extremity function of at least 4 out of 5 strength in at least one arm. On June 9, 2022, we received further clearance from FDA to expand the IFU and labeling to expressly include individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS).
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:

• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; 
• | The quality system regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
• | 510(k) clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 
• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
• | the FDA's recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and 
• | notices provision regarding corrections or removals. 

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: adverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, consent decrees, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted pre-market approvals.
In the year ended December 31, 2022, there were no reports of an adverse event relating to our EksoNR or EksoGT devices reported to the FDA under the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database.
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-referral Laws
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for, or to induce the: 

• | referral on an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs; or 
• | purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs

The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to our arrangements with our United States sales representatives, customers and healthcare providers. Although we believe that we have structured such arrangements to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other applicable laws, regulatory authorities may determine otherwise. Non-compliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in cancellation of our provider numbers and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, as well as civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
Federal law also includes the Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” which prohibits a physician from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member of the physician) has a financial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services for which payment may be made by Medicare or Medicaid, unless an exception applies. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a non-compliant arrangement, civil penalties and fees, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements, regulatory authorities may determine otherwise. 
Additionally, regulations issued for the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law have undergone significant revisions, and it is reasonable to assume that revisions will occur in the future. While we have attempted to operate in compliance with these laws and regulations, our arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law. 
Federal False Claims Act 
The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment to the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” or whistleblower lawsuits against companies. Although we believe that we are in compliance with the federal government’s laws and regulations, if we are found in violation of these laws, penalties of up to $0.025 million for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act, can be assessed. 
Civil Monetary Penalties Law 
The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law grants authority to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) to seek civil monetary penalties (CMPs) against an individual or entity based on a wide variety of conduct including violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, and False Claims Act. An entity that offers to or transfers remuneration to any individual eligible for benefits under Medicare or Medicaid that such entity knows or should know is likely to influence such individual to order or receive from a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier any Medicare or Medicaid payable item or service may be liable for CMPs. We sometimes offer customers various discounts and other financial incentives in connection with the sales of our products. While it is our intent to comply with all applicable laws, the federal government may find that our marketing activities violate the law. If we are found to be in non-compliance, we could be subject to CMPs of up to $0.112 million for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. In addition, to the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
State Fraud and Abuse Provisions 
Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and self-referral laws and false claims act that may apply to DMEPOS suppliers regardless of the payor source. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions. 
HIPAA 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as “covered entities.” Three standards have been promulgated under HIPAA’s regulations: the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, which restrict the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information, the Standards for Electronic Transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures, and the Security Standards, which require covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. 
In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or ARRA, which included sweeping changes to HIPAA, including an expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. ARRA includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, which, among other things, made HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates of covered entities effective February 17, 2010. A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information in connection with recognized healthcare operations activities. As a result, business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable standards. Moreover, HITECH created a requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information and imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. The 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule modified the breach reporting standard in a manner that made more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. 
In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. Any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH or state privacy and security statutes or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results or operations. 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, among other things, imposed public reporting requirements on medical device manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act enacted in 2018, extends the reporting and transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act to physician assistants, nurse practitioners and other mid-level practitioners, with reporting requirements going into effect in 2022 for payments made in 2021. Failure to submit required ownership and investment interest information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $0.18 million per year (or up to an aggregate of $1.191 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also requires healthcare providers to voluntarily report and return an identified Medicare or Medicaid overpayment within 60 days after identifying the overpayment. Failure to repay the overpayment within 60 days will result in the claim being considered a “false claim” and the healthcare provider will be subject to False Claims Act liability, and additional CMPs of $0.112 million for each item or service that is not reported and returned.
Industrial and Medical Device Advertising
Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Recently, promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. If the FDA determines that promotional or training material related to a cleared device 
constitutes the promotion of an un-cleared or unapproved use, the FDA could request that the promotional or training materials related to such device be modified or it could subject the manufacturer to regulatory or enforcement actions under the FDCA or other statutory authorities, such as law prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired.
The FTC regulates the advertising and promotion of products that are medical devices as well as non-medical medical products under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). The FTC Act requires that an advertiser possess, at a minimum, a “reasonable basis” to substantiate all product claims before the claims are made, and competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate health and therapeutic claims. A lack of adequate substantiation may render such claims deceptive and/or misleading. The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, customer redress, restitution, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Although we have not been the subject of any action by the FTC, no assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States. 
In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. Failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States.
Foreign Medical Device Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products in foreign countries. Regardless of the FDA’s approval requirements for a particular product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
In the EU, our products are subject to the medical device regulations of the various member states, which for many years were based on Directives of the European Commission. However, in May 2017, the EU adopted new, formal regulations to replace such Directives; specifically, the EU Medical Device Regulation (the “EU MDR”), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. The EU regulations were adopted with staggered transitional periods that have since been updated. In January 2023, the European Commission endorsed a proposal to extend the original compliance dates for EU MDR, subject to approval by the European Parliament and European Council. The proposal would extend the current EU MDR transitional period deadline of May 2024 to 2027 or 2028, based upon the risk class of the device. Regulatory requirements in the United Kingdom (“UK”) are also changing as a result of Brexit (the UK’s withdrawal from the EU), and regulatory requirements in Switzerland are changing as a result of the country’s withdrawal from its Mutual Recognition Agreement with the EU Commission. Complying with the EU MDR and the evolving regulatory regimes in the UK and Switzerland requires modifications to our quality management systems, additional resources in certain functions and updates to technical files, among other changes. As of December 31, 2022, none of our products had yet been approved under EU MDR.
The European Union requires that manufacturers of medical devices obtain the right to bear the “CE” conformity marking which designates compliance with existing directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture and distribution of medical devices in member countries of the European Union. In 2017, the European Union adopted the European Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745) which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new clinical evaluation, quality system, and post-market surveillance requirements. The regulation had a three-year implementation period, with full application of the regulation occurring in May 2021 and replacing the pre-existing directives on medical devices in the European Union. Since May 2021, medical devices marketed in the European Union require certification according to these new requirements, except those devices with valid CE Marks, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directive before May 2021, including our oxygen therapy products with CE Marks issued under the Medical Device Directive (MDD), may be placed on the market until May 2024. Only medical devices that comply with certain conformity requirements of the Medical Device Directive are currently allowed to be marketed within the European Union and our products will be required to comply with the EU MDR. New products that failed to be certified with the EU MDR by May 2021 may not be marketed or sold in the European Union. Similarly, existing products with CE Marks issued under the MDD may not be placed on the market in the European Union after May 2024. The extension of the existing certificates under the MDD or obtaining a new certificate under the MDR is required for continued marketing in the EU after May 18, 2022. 
On November 5, 2021, we received notification from Health Canada that our EksoNR was reclassified from Class I to Class II, and requested that we reapply for registration under the Medical Device License (MDL) program. Until that license is established, we are restricted from marketing in that country. We are updating our quality system and applying for registration with the expectation that this matter will be resolved by early 2023.
The policies of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products and could also increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
Human Capital Resources and Management
As of March 23, 2023, we had 73 employees, including 60 full time employees and one part-time employee in the United States. Ten employees reside in Europe and two in Singapore. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
We endeavor to maintain a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. We conduct annual training to prevent harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round, including by providing employees with access to an anonymous whistleblower hotline to report any violations. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company includes qualifications, performance, skills, and experience. We believe our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance and are offered training and professional development opportunities. Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain talent. We continually assess and strive to enhance employee satisfaction and engagement.
