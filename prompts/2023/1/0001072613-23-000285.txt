--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on high-quality assets that add scale and provide synergies to our existing portfolio and core areas of operation 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We operate as a single segment as each of our operating areas have similar economic characteristics and each meet the criteria for aggregation as defied by accounting standards related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise.
 
Properties
 
We are an independent operator in four geographic areas in the United States. As operator, we manage and influence production on operated properties. We use a combination of experienced field personnel and third-party service providers to execute our mission. Our properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows, subject to commodity price and cost fluctuations.
 
As is common in the industry in which we operate, we selectively participate in drilling and developmental activities in non-operated properties. Decisions to participate in non-operated properties are made after technical and economic analysis of the projects which also considers the operating expertise and historical track record of the operators.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had approximately 1,100 wells which we operated.
 
We completed a pilot drilling program on four wells in North Dakota and are in the process of completing these wells as of December 31, 2022. During 2022, we had no other drilling activity with the exception of four non-operated wells. No wells were in progress as of December 31, 2021, and we had no drilling activity during 2021 with the exception of four non-operated wells.
 
We have no delivery commitments for oil or natural gas.
 
Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 
 
Our primary mission is to optimize existing producing properties; as such, there are no reserves estimated for undeveloped properties, though we own acreage that can be drilled in the future and are also a non-operator WI owner on acreage subject to future drilling activities. The following table represents our oil and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

 | Oil | Natural Gas | NGL | 
--------------------------------------+--------+-------------+--------+-------
 | (Mbbl) | (MMcf) | (Mbbl) | MBoe 
Proved developed at December 31, 2022 | 8,826 | 12,936 | 2,262 | 13,244
Proved developed at December 31, 2021 | 8,448 | 11,205 | 87 | 10,403

 
Net proved reserves were calculated using an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price within the 12-month period for the year. All prices and costs associated with operating wells were held constant in accordance with SEC guidelines. Prices of $91.14 per barrel of oil, $4.23 per Mcf and $36.29 per barrel of NGL were utilized at December 31, 2022. Prices of $64.31 per barrel and $7.34 per Mcf were utilized at December 31, 2021. Natural gas pricing in 2022 includes prices received for NGLs during the year. In 2021, we did not separately report the NGLs in New Mexico.

Reserve Estimation Process
 
Reserve estimation is a subjective process as the underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas cannot be measured in an exact manner, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. The quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered, production and operating costs, and future oil and natural gas prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates. Our internal professionals work closely with our external engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy, and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve estimation process.
 
We engage an independent petroleum engineering firm, CG&A, to prepare our annual reserve estimates and rely on CG&A’s expertise to ensure that reserve estimates are prepared in accordance with SEC guidelines.
 
The technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is Zane Meekins, Executive Vice President. Mr. Meekins has been with CG&A since 1989 and graduated from Texas A&M University in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in Petroleum Engineering. He is a registered professional engineer in Texas and has more than 30 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of oil and natural gas reserves. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and The Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers.
 
Brian Weatherl, Vice President of Engineering, is responsible for our reservoir engineering, and is a qualified reserve estimator and is responsible for overseeing CG&A during the preparation of the annual reserve estimates. His professional qualifications meet or exceed the qualifications of reserve estimators set forth in the “Standards Pertaining to Estimation and Auditing of Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. His qualifications include a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Tulsa in 1984 and he is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Mr. Weatherl has been estimating and evaluating reserves for over 35 years.
 
The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are technical information, financial data, ownership interest and production data. The relevant field and reservoir technical information, which is updated at least annually, is assessed for validity when CG&A has technical meetings with our personnel. Current revenue and expense information is obtained from accounting records, which are subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits, and internal controls over financial reporting. All current financial data such as commodity prices, lease operating expenses, production taxes and field level commodity price differentials are updated in the reserve database and then analyzed to ensure that they have been entered accurately and that all updates are complete. Our ownership in mineral interests and well production data are subject to internal controls and are incorporated into the reserve database as well as verified internally by our personnel to ensure accuracy and completeness. Once the reserve database has been updated with current information, and the relevant technical support material has been assembled, CG&A meets with technical personnel to review field performance and future development plans in order to verify the validity of estimates. Following these reviews, the reserve database is furnished to CG&A so that it can prepare its independent reserve estimate and final report. The reserve estimates prepared by CG&A are reviewed and compared to internal estimates by Mr. Weatherl. Material reserve estimation differences are reviewed between CG&A and our technical personnel and additional data is provided to address any variances. If the supporting documentation does not justify additional changes, CG&A reserves are accepted. In the event that additional data supports a reserve estimation adjustment, CG&A will analyze the additional data and may make changes it solely deems necessary. Additional data is usually comprised of updated production information on new wells. Once the review is completed and all material differences are reconciled the reserve report is finalized and our reserve database is updated with the final estimates provided by CG&A.
 
COVID-19
 
Despite recoveries in commodity prices, COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact the global economy and disrupt global supply chains and has the potential to continue to create significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute business strategies and initiatives in the expected timeframes, is uncertain and depends on various factors outside of our control, including how the pandemic continues to evolve and how measures taken in response to its effects impact the demand for oil and natural gas, the availability of personnel, equipment, and services critical to our ability to operate our properties and the impact of potential governmental restrictions. There is uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of any disruption.
 
Marketing Arrangements
 
We market our oil and natural gas in accordance with standard energy industry practices. This marketing effort endeavors to obtain the combined highest netback and most secure market available at that time.

-8-
---

We sell oil production at the lease locations to third-party purchasers via truck transport or pipeline. We do not transport, refine or process the oil we produce. We sell our produced oil under contracts using market-based pricing, which is adjusted for differentials based upon oil quality.
 
We sell our natural gas and natural gas liquids under purchase contracts using market-based pricing, which is primarily sold at the lease location.
 
Principal Customers
 
We sell our oil, natural gas, and NGL production to marketers which is transported by truck or pipeline to storage facilities arranged by the marketers. Our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted.
 
For 2022, 68% of revenues from oil, natural gas, and NGL sales were to four customers. For 2021, 63% of revenues from oil, natural gas, and NGL sales were to four customers. While the loss of these purchasers may result in a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our production, we believe that the loss of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as there are alternative purchasers in our producing regions.
 
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry in the areas in which we operate is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from numerous parties, ranging generally from small independent producers to major integrated companies. We primarily encounter significant competition in acquiring properties. At higher commodity prices, we also face competition in contracting for oil field services, rigs, pressure pumping and workover equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial, technical and personnel resources substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable properties, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or personnel resources will permit.
 
In addition to competition for drilling, pressure pumping and workover equipment, we are also affected by the availability of related equipment and materials. The oil and natural gas industry periodically experiences shortages of drilling and workover rigs, equipment, pipe, materials and personnel, which can delay workover and exploration activities and cause significant price increases. We are unable to predict the timing or duration of any such shortages.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
Weather conditions often affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay oil and natural gas production. Demand for natural gas is traditionally higher in the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices during the first and fourth quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results realized on an annual basis.
Markets; Price Volatility
 
The market price of oil and natural gas is volatile, subject to speculative movement and depends upon numerous factors beyond our control, including expectations regarding inflation, global and regional demand, political and economic conditions and production costs. Future profitability, if any, will depend substantially upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.  If the market price for oil and natural gas remains depressed in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional capital necessary to finance operations. Lower oil and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas, if any, that can be produced economically from our properties.  We anticipate that the prices of oil and natural gas will fluctuate in the near future.
Regulation
 
The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the production, transportation and sale of hydrocarbons as well as the taxation of income resulting therefrom.
 
Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is constantly changing.  Numerous federal and state departments and agencies have issued rules and regulations applicable to the oil and natural gas industry.  In general, these rules and regulations regulate, among other things, the extent to which acreage may be acquired or relinquished; spacing of wells; measures required for preventing waste of oil and natural gas resources; and, in some cases, rates of production.  The heavy and increasing regulatory burdens on the oil and natural gas industry increase our cost of doing business and, consequently, affect profitability.

Our oil and natural gas operations are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. These laws govern, among other things, the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment, the issuance of permits in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites.  These laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities if we fail to comply or if any contamination results from our operations.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2022, we had forty full-time employees, not including contract personnel and outsourced service providers. Our team is broadly experienced in oil and natural gas operations and follows a strategy of outsourcing most accounting, human resources, and other non-core functions.
Office Locations
 
Our corporate headquarters are at 2200 South Utica Place, Suite 150, Tulsa, Oklahoma, with field offices in North Dakota, Texas, and New Mexico.
