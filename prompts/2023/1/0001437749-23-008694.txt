History
 
Ultralife was formed as a Delaware corporation in December 1990. In March 1991, we acquired certain technology and assets from Eastman Kodak Company (“Kodak”) relating to its 9‑volt Lithium Manganese Dioxide non-rechargeable battery. In December 1992, we completed our initial public offering and became listed on NASDAQ.
 
In May 2006, we acquired ABLE New Energy Co., Ltd. (“ABLE”), an established manufacturer of Lithium batteries located in Shenzhen, China, which broadened our product offering, including a wide range of Lithium Thionyl Chloride and Lithium Manganese batteries, and provided additional exposure to new consumer markets.
 
In July 2006, we finalized the acquisition of substantially all the assets of McDowell Research, Ltd. (“McDowell”), a manufacturer of military communications accessories. This acquisition expanded our product distribution channels into the military communications area and strengthened our presence in global defense markets. During the second half of 2007, the operations of the Waco, Texas facility of McDowell were relocated to our Newark, New York facility. In January 2012, we relocated these operations to our Virginia Beach, Virginia facility in order to gain operational efficiencies.
 
In March 2008, we formed a joint venture, named Ultralife Batteries India Private Limited (“India JV”), with our distributor partner in India. The India JV assembles Ultralife power solution products and manages local sales and marketing activities, serving commercial, government and defense customers throughout India. We have invested cash into the India JV, as consideration for our 51% ownership stake in the India JV.
 
In March 2009, we acquired the tactical communications products business of Science Applications International Corporation. The tactical communications products business designs, develops and manufactures tactical communications products including: amplifiers, man-portable systems, cables, power solutions and ancillary communications equipment, which are sold by Ultralife under the brand name AMTI. The acquisition strengthened our communications systems business and provided us with direct entry into the handheld radio/amplifier market, complementing Ultralife’s communications systems offerings.
 
In January 2016, we acquired Accutronics Limited (“Accutronics”), a U.K. corporation based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, U.K., a leading independent designer and manufacturer of smart batteries and charger systems for high-performance, feature-laden portable and handheld electronic devices. With a portfolio encompassing custom battery design, development and manufacturing for OEM’s; standard smart batteries, chargers and accessories; and pre-engineered batteries and power solutions for specific applications, Accutronics primarily serves the portable medical device market throughout Europe. Medical applications include digital imaging, ventilators, anesthesia, endoscopy, patient monitoring, cardiopulmonary care, oxygen concentration and aspiration. We acquired Accutronics to advance our strategy of commercial revenue diversification, to expand our geographical penetration, and to achieve revenue growth from new product development. We are continuing to experience sales synergies between Accutronics and our existing commercial battery business as we cross-sell our existing products and the acquired Accutronics’ products to our respective customer bases.
 
On May 1, 2019, we acquired Southwest Electronic Energy Corporation, a Texas corporation (“SWE”), and a leading designer and manufacturer of high-performance smart battery systems and battery packs to customer specifications using Lithium cells. SWE serves a variety of industrial markets, including oil and gas, remote monitoring, process control and marine, which demand uncompromised safety, service, reliability and quality. We acquired SWE as a bolt-on acquisition to further support our strategy of commercial revenue diversification by providing entry to the oil and gas exploration and production, and subsea electrification markets, which were previously unserved by Ultralife. Another key benefit of our acquisition of SWE includes obtaining a highly valuable technical team of battery pack and charger system engineers and technicians to add to our new product development-based revenue growth initiatives in our commercial end-markets particularly asset tracking devices, smart metering for utilities and other industrial applications.
 
On December 13, 2021, we acquired Excell Battery Canada Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“Excell Canada”), and 656700 B.C. Ltd., a British Columbia corporation (“656700”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Excell Battery Corporation USA, a Texas corporation (“Excell USA” and together with Excell Canada and 656700, collectively, “Excell”), which operate under the name Excell Battery Group, based in Canada with U.S. operations, a leading independent designer and manufacturer of high-performance smart battery systems, battery packs and monitoring systems to customer specifications.

Products, Services and Technology
 
Battery & Energy Products ’
 
A non-rechargeable battery is used until discharged and then replaced. The principal competing non-rechargeable battery technologies are Carbon Zinc, Alkaline and Lithium. We manufacture a range of non-rechargeable battery products based on Lithium Manganese Dioxide, Lithium Manganese Dioxide Carbon Monofluoride hybrid, and Lithium Thionyl Chloride technologies.
 
Non-Rechargeable Batteries
 
We believe that the chemistry of Lithium batteries provides significant advantages over currently available non-rechargeable battery technologies, which include: lighter weight, longer operating time, longer shelf life, and a wider operating temperature range. Our non-rechargeable batteries also have relatively flat voltage profiles, which provide more stable power. Conventional non-rechargeable batteries, such as Alkaline batteries, have sloping voltage profiles that result in decreasing power during discharge. While the prices for our Lithium batteries are generally higher than commercially available Alkaline batteries produced by others, we believe that the increased energy per unit of weight and volume of our batteries will allow longer operating time and less frequent battery replacements for our targeted applications. As a result, we believe that our non-rechargeable batteries are priced competitively with other battery technologies on a price per unit of energy or volume basis.
 
Our non-rechargeable products include the following product configurations:
 
9‑Volt Lithium Battery. Our 9‑volt Lithium battery delivers a unique combination of the highest-available energy density and stable voltage, which results in a longer operating life for the battery and, accordingly, fewer battery replacements. While our 9‑volt battery price is generally higher than conventional 9‑volt Carbon Zinc and Alkaline batteries, we believe the enhanced operating performance and decreased costs associated with longer battery life make our 9‑volt battery more cost effective than conventional batteries on a cost per unit of energy or volume basis when used in a variety of applications.
 
We market our 9-volt Lithium batteries to OEM, distributor and retail markets including industrial electronics, safety and security, and medical. Typical applications include: smoke alarms, wireless alarm systems, bone growth stimulators, telemetry devices, blood analyzers, ambulatory infusion pumps and parking meters. A significant portion of the sales of our 9-volt battery is to major smoke alarm OEMs for use in their long-life smoke alarms. We also manufacture our 9‑volt Lithium battery under private labels for a variety of companies. Additionally, we sell our 9‑volt battery to the broader consumer market through national and regional retail chains and online retailers.
 
We believe our current 9-volt battery manufacturing capacity is adequate to meet forecasted customer demand over the next three years.
 
Cylindrical Batteries. Featuring high energy, wide temperature range, long shelf life and operating life, our cylindrical cells and batteries, based on Lithium Manganese Dioxide, Lithium Manganese Dioxide Carbon Monofluoride hybrid and Lithium Thionyl Chloride technologies, represent some of the most advanced Lithium power sources currently available. We market a wide range of cylindrical non-rechargeable Lithium cells and batteries in various sizes under both the Ultralife HiRate and ABLE brands. These include: D, C, 5/4 C, 1/2 AA, 2/3 A, CR123A and other sizes, which are sold individually as well as packaged into multi-cell battery packs, including our leading BA-5390 military battery, an alternative to the competing Li-SO2 BA-5590 battery, a widely used battery type in the U.S. armed forces for portable applications. Our BA-5390 battery provides 50% to 100% more energy (mission time) than the BA-5590, and it is used in approximately 60 military applications. With the introduction of our Lithium Carbon Monofluoride hybrid chemistry, we now offer a D-cell that has 100% more energy than the competing Li-SO2 D-cell.
 
We market our line of Lithium cells and batteries to the OEM market for commercial, defense, medical, asset tracking and search and rescue applications, among others. Significant commercial applications include oil and gas, pipeline inspection equipment, automatic re-closers and oceanographic and subsea devices. Asset tracking applications include Radio Frequency Identification (“RFID”), cellular, and Bluetooth systems. Among the defense uses are manpack radios, night vision goggles, chemical agent monitors and thermal imaging equipment. Medical applications include: Automated External Defibrillators (“AEDs”), infusion pumps, wearable patient monitoring and telemetry systems. Search and rescue applications include Emergency Locator Transmitters (“ELTs”) for aircraft and Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons (“EPIRBs”) for ships. Oil and gas applications include battery packs for downhole and directional drilling applications such as Measurement While Drilling (“MWD”) and Logging While Drilling (“LWD”) and pipeline inspection and monitoring.

Thin Cell Batteries. We manufacture a range of thin Lithium Manganese Dioxide batteries under the Thin Cell® brand. Thin Cell batteries are flat, lightweight batteries providing a unique combination of high energy, long shelf life, wide operating temperature range and very low profile. We are currently marketing these batteries to OEMs for applications such as displays, wearable medical devices, toll passes, theft detection systems, and RFID and Bluetooth tracking devices.
Rechargeable Batteries
 
In contrast to non-rechargeable batteries, after a rechargeable battery is discharged, it can be recharged and reused many times. Generally, discharge and recharge cycles can be repeated hundreds or thousands of times in rechargeable batteries depending on the technology of the battery. The achievable number of cycles (cycle life) varies among technologies and is an important competitive factor. All rechargeable batteries experience a small, but measurable, loss in energy capacity with each cycle. The industry commonly reports cycle life in the number of cycles a battery can achieve until 80% of the battery’s initial energy capacity remains. In the rechargeable battery market, the principal competing technologies are Nickel Metal Hydride and Lithium-ion (including Lithium polymer) batteries. Rechargeable batteries are used in many applications, such as military radios, laptop computers, mobile telephones, portable medical devices, wearable devices and many other commercial, defense and consumer products.
 
Three important performance characteristics of a rechargeable battery are design flexibility, energy density and cycle life. Design flexibility refers to the ability of rechargeable batteries to be designed to fit a variety of shapes and sizes of battery compartments. Thin profile batteries with prismatic geometry provide the design flexibility to fit the battery compartments of today's electronic devices. Energy density refers to the total amount of electrical energy stored in a battery divided by the battery’s weight and volume as measured in watt-hours per kilogram and watt-hours per liter, respectively. High energy density batteries generally are longer lasting power sources providing longer operating time and necessitating fewer battery recharges. High energy density and long achievable cycle life are important characteristics for comparing rechargeable battery technologies. Greater energy density will permit the use of batteries of a given weight or volume for a longer time period. Accordingly, greater energy density will enable the use of smaller and lighter batteries with energy comparable to those currently marketed. Lithium-ion batteries, by the nature of their electrochemical properties, are capable of providing higher energy density than comparably sized batteries that utilize other chemistries and, therefore, tend to consume less volume and weight for a given energy content. Long achievable cycle life, particularly in combination with high energy density, is suitable for applications requiring frequent battery recharges, such as cellular telephones and notebook computers, and allows the user to charge and recharge many times before noticing a difference in performance. We believe that our Lithium-ion batteries generally have high energy density and a long cycle life.
 
Lithium-ion Cells and Batteries. We market a variety of Lithium-ion cells and rechargeable batteries comprised of cells manufactured by qualified cell manufacturers. These products are used in a wide variety of applications including communications, medical and other portable electronic devices.
Battery Charging Systems and Accessories. To provide our customers with complete power system solutions, we offer a wide range of rugged military and commercial battery charging systems and accessories including smart chargers, multi-bay charging systems and a variety of cables.
 
Multi-Kilowatt Module. Our Multi-Kilowatt Module Lithium-ion battery system is a large format battery utilizable for energy storage, battery back-up, and remote power applications. This product is a direct replacement of 1.25 kWh and larger capacity lead acid batteries in 24V or 48V applications. It can be connected in multiples to obtain higher-voltages and is capable of over 3,000 cycles while maintaining 80% of its capacity.
 
Technology Contracts. Our technology contract activities involve the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products through contracts with both government agencies and private sector third parties.

Sales and Marketing
 
We employ a staff of sales and marketing personnel in North America, Europe and Asia. We sell our products and services directly to commercial customers, including OEMs, as well as government and defense agencies in the U.S. and abroad and have contractual arrangements with sales agents who market our products on a commission basis in defined territories. Every effort is made to adjust future prices when and if possible, but the ability to adjust prices is generally based on market conditions.
 
We also distribute some of our products through domestic and foreign distributors and retailers. These sales are generated primarily from customer purchase orders. We have several long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers. These contracts do not commit the customers to specific purchase volumes, nor to specific timing of purchase order releases, and they include fixed price agreements over various periods of time. In general, we do not believe our sales are seasonal, although we may sometimes experience seasonality for some of our military products based on the timing of government fiscal budget expenditures.
 
A significant portion of our business comes from sales of products and services to U.S. and foreign governments through various contracts. These contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations that specify policies and procedures for acquiring goods and services. The procurement laws and regulations also contain guidelines for managing contracts after they are awarded, including conditions under which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the government’s convenience or for default. Failure to comply with applicable procurement laws or regulations can result in civil, criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines, penalties, suspension of payments, or suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Even if a contract is awarded to us there is no guarantee that the government will order any product under the contract.
 
We have one major customer, a large global defense primary contractor, which comprised 17% of our total revenues in 2022, and 20% of our total revenues in 2021. There were no other customers that comprised greater than 10% of our total revenues during these years.
 
In 2022, sales to U.S. and foreign customers were approximately $67,914 and $63,926, respectively. In 2021, sales to U.S. and foreign customers were approximately $48,819 and $49,448, respectively.

Battery & Energy Products 
 
We target sales of our non-rechargeable products to manufacturers of security and safety equipment, medical devices, search and rescue equipment, specialty instruments, oil and gas downhole drilling and pipe inspection equipment, point of sale equipment and metering applications, as well as users of military equipment. Our strategy is to develop sales and marketing alliances with OEMs and governmental agencies that utilize our batteries in their products, commit to cooperative research and development or marketing programs, and recommend our products for design-in or replacement use in their products. We are addressing these markets through direct contact by our sales and technical personnel, use of sales agents and stocking distributors, manufacturing under private labels, and promotional activities.
 
We seek to capture a significant market share for our products within our targeted OEM markets, which we believe, if successful, will result in increased product awareness and sales at the end‑user or consumer level. We are also selling our 9‑volt battery to the consumer market through retail distribution channels. Most military procurements are done directly by the specific government organizations requiring products, based on a competitive bidding process. Additionally, we are typically required to successfully meet contractual specifications and to pass various qualifications testing for the products under contract by the military. Our inability to pass these tests for our new products in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on future growth prospects. When a government contract is awarded, there is a government procedure that permits unsuccessful companies to formally protest the award if they believe they were unjustly treated in the government’s bid evaluation process. A prolonged delay in the resolution of a protest, or a reversal of an award resulting from such a protest, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We market our products to defense organizations in the U.S. and other countries. In September 2019, we were awarded an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract from the U.S. Government’s Defense Logistics Agency for up to five years, with the potential to generate revenue of $14,422, to provide our BA-5368 batteries. In May 2021 we were awarded an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract from the U.S. Army for purchases of Conformal Wear Batteries not to exceed $168,000 during the three-year base award period with the potential for up to an additional $350,000 should the six one-year options be exercised. We are scheduled to complete First Article Testing under this contract in the second half of 2023. In December 2021, we were awarded an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract not to exceed $9,900 for the U.S. Government’s Defense Logistics Agency for our lithium manganese dioxide, non-rechargeable BA-5390 batteries. The award consists of a three-year base contract with two one-year option periods.
 
We target sales of our Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries and charging systems to OEM customers, as well as distributors and resellers focused on our target markets. We respond to Requests for Proposals (“RFPs”) to design products for OEMs, and believe that our design capabilities, product characteristics and solution integration will encourage OEMs to incorporate our batteries into their product offerings, resulting in revenue growth opportunities for us.
 
We continue to expand our marketing activities as part of our strategic plan, a comprehensive forward-looking document which sets forth our strategic growth plans, tactical actions and financial projections over a rolling three-year period, to increase sales of our battery and energy products for commercial, standby, defense and communications applications, as well as hand-held devices, wearable devices and other electronic portable equipment. A key part of this expansion includes increasing our design and assembly capabilities as well as building our international network of distributors and value-added distributors.
 
At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our backlog related to Battery & Energy Products was approximately $88,600 and $55,300, respectively. The 60% year-over-year increase in our Battery & Energy Products backlog at December 31, 2022 primarily resulted from the demand for our medical, government & defense and oil & gas batteries, which in some cases includes orders pushed into 2023 because of the supply chain disruptions experienced in 2022.
 
The 2022 year-end backlog is primarily related to orders that are expected to ship throughout 2023 and does not include future shipments under the indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity Defense Logistics Agency award for BA-5390 batteries ($9,900) and the U.S. Army award for Conformal Wearable Batteries ($168,000).

We expect our future raw material purchases to fluctuate based on global demand for our products, our knowledge regarding the timing of customer orders, the related need to build inventory in anticipation of orders and actual shipment dates. The prices and availability of raw materials were impacted by COVID/supply chain disruptions in 2022 and may continue to be affected in 2023.
 

Battery & Energy Products 
 
Our Newark, New York and Shenzhen, China facilities have the capacity to produce cylindrical cells, 9-volt batteries, 3-volt battery and thin cells. Capacity, however, is also affected by demand for particular products, and product mix changes can produce bottlenecks in an individual operation, constraining overall capacity. We have acquired new machinery and equipment in areas where production bottlenecks have occurred in the past and we believe that we have sufficient capacity in these areas. We continually evaluate our requirements for additional capital equipment, and we believe that planned increases will be adequate to meet foreseeable customer demand.
 
Certain materials used in our products, other than rechargeable battery cells, are available only from a single source or a limited number of sources. Additionally, we may elect to develop relationships with a single or limited number of sources for materials that are otherwise generally available. Although we believe that alternative sources may in some cases be available to supply materials that could replace materials we use and that, if necessary, we would be able to redesign our products to make use of an alternative material provided extensive customer testing and recertification are not required, any interruption in our supply from any supplier that serves currently as our sole source could delay product shipments and adversely affect our financial performance and relationships with our customers. Although we have experienced interruptions of product deliveries by sole source and other suppliers in 2022 resulting in the delay of shipments to future periods, we cannot assure that these interruptions and delays will not have an adverse effect on us in the future.
 
Generally, the raw materials and components utilized for our rechargeable batteries are readily available from many sources. Although we believe that alternative sources are available to supply materials and components that could replace materials or components we use, any interruption in our supply from any supplier that serves currently as our sole source could delay product shipments and adversely affect our financial performance and relationships with our customers.
 
Our Newark, New York facility has the capacity to produce significant volumes of batteries and energy products. This operation generally manufacturers non-rechargeable battery cells, non-rechargeable and rechargeable battery packs, and chargers and is limited only by physical space and is not constrained by manufacturing equipment capacity which can accommodate significant additional volumes of product. Similarly, our China and United Kingdom facilities also have capacity to produce significant quantities of non-rechargeable batteries and rechargeable battery packs beyond current volumes and are not constrained by manufacturing equipment capacity. Our Missouri City, Texas facility has the capacity to produce significant quantities of non-rechargeable battery packs and is not constrained by manufacturing equipment capacity. We are in the process of assessing the capacity our Excell facilities in Houston, Texas and in Calgary, Mississauga and Vancouver, Canada to determine constraints associated with human capital resources or manufacturing equipment.
 
The total carrying value of our Battery & Energy Products inventory, including raw materials, work in process and finished goods, amounted to $32,771 and $25,677 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year-over-year 28% increase primarily reflects an increase in materials, including rechargeable cells, required to fulfill the backlog for our batteries primarily used in the medical devices, government & defense and oil & gas sectors. Management continuously monitors inventory levels in an effort to optimize such levels.
 

Communications Systems 
 
In general, we believe that the raw materials and components utilized by us for our communications and commercial accessories and systems, including RF amplifiers, power supplies, cables, repeaters and integration kits and systems, are available from many sources. Although we believe that alternative sources are available to supply materials and components that could replace materials or components we use, any interruption in our supply from any supplier that serves currently as our sole source or any significant increase in lead times to provide components could delay product shipments and adversely affect our financial performance and relationships with our customers.
 
Our Virginia Beach, Virginia facility has the sufficient capacity to produce communications products and systems to meet current demand. This operation generally assembles products and is limited only by physical space and is not constrained by manufacturing equipment capacity.

The total carrying value of our Communications Systems inventory, including raw materials, work in process and finished goods, amounted to $8,421 and $7,512 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year-over-year 12% increase is due to the procurement of longer lead time components to meet the commitment dates of our backlog orders. Management continuously monitors inventory levels in an effort to optimize such levels.
 

Research and Development
 
We devote significant resources to research and development activities to improve the technological capabilities of our products and to design new products for customers’ applications. We conduct our research and development in Newark, New York; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Tallahassee, Florida; Missouri City, Texas; Newcastle-under-Lyme, United Kingdom; and Shenzhen, China. During 2022 and 2021, we expended $7,874 and $8,042, respectively, on research and development, including $793 and $1,216, respectively, on customer sponsored research and development activities, which are included in cost of products sold. The year-over-year decrease in customer sponsored research and development is due to the timing of key projects and helped to offset our increased costs for the hiring of engineering resources to support new product development in our Battery & Energy Products business segment, including the inclusion of a full year of operations for Excell which was acquired on December 13, 2021.
 
We expect that research and development expenditures in the future could increase by 10% or more over 2022 levels, based on current initiatives. These current initiatives include completing the development and testing of new battery and power solutions in our facilities in Newark, New York, Houston and Missouri City, Texas, Canada and Newcastle-under-Lyme, UK; our Thionyl Chloride battery project in China and new product initiatives for our Communications Systems business. Our expectation is that new product development is one of the factors that will drive our growth. As in the past, we will continue to make funding decisions for our research and development efforts based upon demand for customer applications.

We continue to internally develop non-rechargeable cells and batteries with the goal of broadening our product offering to our customers.
 
We continue to internally develop our rechargeable product portfolio, including batteries, battery management systems, cables and charging systems, as our customers’ needs for portable power continue to grow and new technologies become available.
 
The U.S. government sponsors research and development programs, which Ultralife participates in, designed to improve the performance and safety of existing battery systems and to develop new battery systems.
 

Communications Systems 
 
We continue to internally develop a variety of communications accessories and systems for the global defense and commercial markets to meet the ever-changing demands of our customers.
Safety; Regulatory Matters; Environmental Considerations 
 
Certain materials utilized in our batteries may pose safety problems if improperly used, stored, or handled. We have designed our batteries to minimize safety hazards both in manufacturing and in use. Our batteries are subject to the regulations noted below, among others.
 
The transportation of non-rechargeable and rechargeable Lithium batteries is regulated in the U.S. by the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), and internationally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) and corresponding International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), Dangerous Goods Regulations and the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (“IMDG”), and other country specific regulations. These regulations are based on the United Nations Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and the United Nations Manual of Tests and Criteria. We currently ship our products pursuant to PHMSA, ICAO, IATA, IMDG and other country specific hazardous goods regulations. The regulations require companies to meet certain testing, packaging, labeling, marking and shipping paper specifications for safety reasons. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, any significant costs in order to comply with these regulations. We believe we comply with all current U.S. and international regulations for the shipment of our products, and we intend and expect to comply with any new regulations that are imposed. We have established our own testing facilities to ensure that we comply with these regulations. However, if we are unable to comply with any such new regulations, or if regulations are introduced that limit our or our customers’ ability to transport our products in a cost-effective manner, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The European Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (the “EU RoHS Directive”) places restrictions on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. All applicable products sold in the European Union market must pass RoHS compliance. While this directive does not apply to batteries and does not currently affect our defense products, should any changes occur in the directive that would affect our products, we intend and expect to comply with any new regulations that are imposed. However, we cannot ensure that the cost of complying with such new regulations would not have a material adverse effect on us. We believe our commercial chargers are substantially in compliance with the EU RoHS Directive.
 
The European Union’s Battery Directive “on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators” (the “EU Battery Directive”) is intended to cover all types of batteries regardless of their shape, volume, weight, material composition or use. It is aimed at reducing mercury, cadmium, lead and other metals in the environment by minimizing the use of these substances in batteries and by treating and re-using old batteries. The EU Battery Directive applies to all types of batteries except those used to protect European member states’ security, for military purposes, or sent into space. To achieve these objectives, the EU Battery Directive prohibits the marketing of some batteries containing hazardous substances. It establishes schemes aimed at high levels of collection and recycling of batteries with quantified collection and recycling targets. The EU Battery Directive sets out minimum rules for producer responsibility and provisions with regard to labeling of batteries and their removability from equipment. The EU Battery Directive requires product markings for batteries and accumulators to provide information on capacity and to facilitate reuse and safe disposal. We currently ship our products pursuant to the requirements of the EU Battery Directive.

The EU Battery Directive requires producers or importers of particular classes of electrical goods to be financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. This directive assigns levels of responsibility to companies doing business in European Union markets based on their relative market share. This directive calls on each European Union member state to enact enabling legislation to implement the directive. As additional European Union member states pass enabling legislation our compliance system should be sufficient to meet such requirements. Our current estimated costs associated with our compliance with these directives based on our current market share are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of these directives as European Union member states implement guidance, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates.
 
China’s “Management Methods for Restricted Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products” (“China RoHS 2”) provides a regulatory framework including hazardous substance restrictions similar to those imposed by the EU RoHS Directive. China RoHS 2 applies to methods for the control and reduction of pollution and other public hazards to the environment caused during the production, sale, and import of electrical and electronic products (“EEP”) in China. The regulatory framework of China RoHS 2 also now references the updated marking and labeling requirements under Standard SJ/T 11364-2014. The methods under China RoHS 2 only apply to EEP placed in the marketplace in China. We believe our compliance system is sufficient to meet our requirements under China RoHS 2. Our current estimated costs associated with our compliance with this regulation based on our current market share are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of this regulation, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates.
 
National, state and local laws impose various environmental controls on the manufacture, transportation, storage, use and disposal of batteries and of certain chemicals used in the manufacture of batteries. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with current environmental regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities, costs and expenses. There can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture, transportation, storage, use and disposal of materials used to manufacture our batteries or restricting disposal of batteries will not be imposed or that such regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2022 and 2021, we spent $264 and $208, respectively, on environmental compliance, including costs to properly dispose of potentially hazardous waste.
 
Since non-rechargeable and rechargeable Lithium battery chemistries react adversely with water and water vapor, certain of our manufacturing processes must be performed in a controlled environment with low relative humidity. Our Newark, New York and Shenzhen, China facilities contain dry rooms or glove box equipment, as well as specialized air-drying equipment.

In addition to the environmental regulations previously described, our products are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”), the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and trade sanctions against embargoed countries.
 
The ITAR is a set of U.S. government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List. These regulations implement the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act, and are described in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Department of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls interprets and enforces ITAR. Its goal is to safeguard U.S. national security and further U.S. foreign policy objectives.
 
The related EAR are enforced and interpreted by the Bureau of Industry and Security in the Commerce Department. The Department of Defense is also involved in the review and approval process. Inspections in support of import and export laws are performed at border crossings by Customs and Border Protection, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security.
 
Products and services developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to the export and import controls of the nation in which the foreign location operates.
 
We believe we are in material compliance with these domestic and international export regulations. However, failure of compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business through possible fines, denial of export privileges, or loss of customers. Further, while we are not aware of any proposed changes to these regulations, any change in the scope or enforcement of export or import regulations or related legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business through increased costs of compliance or reduction in the international growth prospects available to us.
 
Based upon our current sales volumes, our future estimated costs associated with our compliance with ITAR, EAR, and the foreign export and import controls are not significant. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of these regulations, and actual costs could differ from our current estimates.
 

Battery & Energy Products 
 
Our non-rechargeable battery products incorporate Lithium metal, which reacts with water and may cause fires if not handled properly. In the past, we have experienced fires that have temporarily interrupted certain manufacturing operations. We believe that we have adequate fire suppression systems and insurance, including business interruption insurance, to protect against the occurrence of fires and fire losses in our facilities.
 
Our 9‑volt battery, among other sizes, is designed to conform to the dimensional and electrical standards of the American National Standards Institute. Authorized certification bodies such as Underwriters Laboratories, Intertek and SGS have certified several of our products.
 

Communications Systems
 
We are not currently aware of any regulatory requirements regarding the disposal of our communications products.
 

Corporate
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 Section 1502 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) requires public companies to disclose whether tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, commonly known as “conflict minerals,” are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by a public company and if those elements originated from armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. To comply with the Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by SEC rules, we are required to perform due diligence inquiries of our suppliers to determine whether or not our products contain such minerals and from which countries and source (smelter) the minerals were obtained. Our annual report on Form SD was filed by the statutory due date of May 31, 2022 for the 2021 calendar year and we continue to utilize appropriate measures with our suppliers to better ascertain the origin of the conflict minerals in our products.

Competition
 
Competition in both the battery and communications systems markets is, and is expected to remain, intense. The competition ranges from development stage companies to major domestic and international companies, many of which have financial, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources significantly greater than ours. We compete against companies producing batteries as well as companies producing communications systems. We compete on the basis of design flexibility, performance, price, reliability and customer support. There can be no assurance that our technologies and products will not be rendered obsolete by developments in competing technologies or services that are currently under development or that may be developed in the future or that our competitors will not market competing products and services that obtain market acceptance more rapidly than ours.
 
While we cannot assure that other entities will not attempt to take advantage of the growth of the battery market, the Lithium battery cell industry has certain technological and economic barriers to entry. The development of technology, equipment and manufacturing techniques and the operation of a facility for the automated production of Lithium battery cells require large capital expenditures, which may deter new competitors from commencing production. Through our experience in battery cell manufacturing, we have also developed significant production and design expertise in the non-rechargeable battery market, which we believe would be difficult for new competitors to reproduce without substantial time and expense.
 

Employees 
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 547 permanent and temporary employees: 424 in production, 78 in sales and administration, and 45 in research and development. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
