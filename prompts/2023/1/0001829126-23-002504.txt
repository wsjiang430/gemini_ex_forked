Overview
 
We are a pharmaceutical company developing therapeutics utilizing our proprietary long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura®, for the treatment of select chronic diseases for which steady state delivery of a drug has the potential to provide an efficacy and/or safety benefit. ProNeura consists of a small, solid implant made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate, or EVA, and a drug substance. The resulting product is a solid matrix that is designed to be administered subdermally in a brief, outpatient procedure and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period.
 
Our first product based on our ProNeura technology was Probuphine® (buprenorphine implant), which is approved in the United States, Canada and the European Union, or EU, for the maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder in clinically stable patients taking 8 mg or less a day of oral buprenorphine. While Probuphine continues to be commercialized in Canada and in the EU (as Sixmo™) by other companies that have either licensed or acquired the rights from Titan, we discontinued commercialization of the product in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2020 to allow us to focus our limited resources on product development programs.
 
In December 2021, we announced our intention to work with our financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives to enhance stockholder value, potentially including an acquisition, merger, reverse merger, other business combination, sales of assets, licensing or other transaction. In June 2022, we implemented a plan to reduce expenses and conserve capital that included a company-wide reduction in salaries and a scale back of certain operating expenses to enable us to maintain sufficient resources as we pursued potential strategic alternatives. In July 2022, David Lazar and Activist Investing LLC (collectively, “Activist”) acquired an approximately 25% ownership interest in Titan, filed a proxy statement and nominated six additional directors, each of whom was elected to our board of directors (the “Board”) at a special meeting of stockholders held on August 15, 2022 (the “Special Meeting”). The exploration and evaluation of possible strategic alternatives by the Board has continued following the Special Meeting. Following the election of the new directors at the Special Meeting, Dr. Marc Rubin was replaced as our Executive Chairman, and David Lazar assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. In connection with the termination of his employment as Executive Chairman, Dr. Rubin will receive aggregate severance payments of approximately $0.4 million, of which, approximately $165,000 have been paid as of December 31, 2022. In December 2022, we implemented additional cost reduction measures including a reduction in our workforce.


ProNeura Continuous Drug Delivery Platform
 
Our ProNeura continuous drug delivery system consists of a small, solid rod-shaped implant made from a mixture of EVA and a given drug substance. The resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subdermally, normally in the inside part of the upper arm in a brief procedure using a local anaesthetic and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period. The drug substance is released continuously through the process of dissolution-controlled diffusion. This results in a continuous, steady rate of release generally similar to intravenous administration. We believe that such long-term, near linear release characteristics are desirable as they avoid the fluctuating peak and trough drug levels seen with oral dosing that often poses treatment problems in a range of diseases.
 
The ProNeura platform was developed to address the need for a simple, practical method to achieve continuous long-term drug delivery, and, depending on the characteristics of the compound to be delivered, can potentially provide treatment on an outpatient basis over extended periods of up to 12 months. We believe that the benefits of this technology have been demonstrated by the clinical results seen to date with Probuphine, and, in addition, that the development and regulatory process have been affirmed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and Health Canada approvals of this product. We have further demonstrated the feasibility of the ProNeura platform with small molecules, hormones, and bio-active peptides. The delivery system works with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules. We have also shown the flexibility of the platform by experimenting with the release characteristics of the EVA implants, layering the implants with varying concentrations of drug, and generating implants of different sizes and porosity to achieve a desired delivery profile.

Development Programs
 
We currently have the following development programs for which development activities have been substantially curtailed while we are exploring several financing and strategic alternatives.
 
TP-2021
 
Several years ago, we began limited non-clinical laboratory experiments in collaboration with JT Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or JT Pharma, to assess the feasibility of delivering JT Pharma’s kappa opioid agonist peptide, or TP-2021, utilizing our ProNeura system. Following our acquisition of TP-2021 in October 2020, we successfully manufactured a prototype implant containing TP-2021 (TP-2021 - ProNeura) to be used in appropriate small animal models. While our initial work focused on TP-2021’s ability to activate peripheral kappa opioid receptors, potentially providing a non-addictive treatment for certain types of pain, in January 2021, our research pivoted to explore the feasibility of using TP-2021 in the treatment of chronic pruritus, a severe and debilitating condition defined as itching of the skin lasting longer than six weeks. According to a 2015 review by Mollanazar, N., et al., an estimated 23 – 44 million Americans suffer from chronic pruritus of both cutaneous and systemic etiologies. Current treatments include antihistamines, corticosteroids, and over-the-counter lotions, all of which are relatively ineffective and/or have undesirable side-effect profiles. The antipruritic effect of kappa opioid agonists is thought to be related to their binding to kappa opioid receptors on keratinocytes, immune cells, and peripheral itch neurons.
 
In February 2021, we announced that early non-clinical studies of TP-2021 showed very high affinity and specificity for the human kappa opioid receptor and demonstrated potent antipruritic activity when injected subcutaneously in a mouse model for moderate to severe pruritus. TP-2021 - ProNeura implants were then formulated and tested in this model. In November 2021, data presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience demonstrated that significant reduction in scratching behavior in this proven animal model for pruritus was maintained in mice who received the TP-2021 - ProNeura implant through Day 56 post-implantation, when compared with control untreated mice, with no safety issues observed for the implanted animals over the three-month duration of treatment. Subsequently, efficacy in this pruritus model has been extended through Day 84 post-implantation. In addition, the TP-2021 - ProNeura implant provided sustained supra-therapeutic plasma levels of the peptide through Day 84 post-implantation in a separate pharmacokinetic study in mice. We believe that subdermal implantation of TP-2021 - ProNeura could potentially deliver therapeutic concentrations of TP-2021 in human subjects for up to six months or longer following a single in-office procedure. Investigational New Drug, or IND, enabling non-clinical safety and pharmacology studies will need to be conducted in preparation for regulatory approval to enter human clinical studies. Additional funding from external sources for progression of the non-clinical program is required but will be dependent on finding a suitable partner.
 
Nalmefene Development Program
 
A subdermal ProNeura implant containing nalmefene for the prevention of opioid relapse following detoxification of patients suffering opioid use disorder. The FDA cleared the IND for this program in July 2022. To date, this program has been partially supported by a September 2019 grant from the National Institute for Drug Addiction, or NIDA, which provided approximately $8.7 million of Federal money for the completion of implant formulation development, cGMP manufacturing and non-clinical studies required for filing an IND. Following the clearance of the IND, we may be eligible for additional grant funding of approximately $6.3 million from NIDA. However, this funding availability is dependent on a progress review at NIDA. Additional funding from external sources for progression of the clinical program will be separately sought but will be dependent on finding a suitable partner.
 
In early 2020, following a meeting with the FDA to review our non-clinical development plans and obtain guidance regarding filing an IND, the FDA provided clear guidance on the type of development plan that we should follow. Specifically, the FDA advised that this product development should follow the more expansive 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway rather than the shorter, more streamlined 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway we had been pursuing. In September 2021, the FDA advised that it was reconsidering the regulatory pathway for the nalmefene implant and could ultimately determine that the 505(b)(2) process is potentially appropriate. 
 
Gates Foundation
 
In October 2021, we received an approximately $500,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to demonstrate the ability to deliver a combination HIV preventative therapeutic and a contraceptive from a single ProNeura implant for women and adolescent girls in low- and middle-income countries.

Agreements
 
JT Pharmaceuticals
 
In October 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or the JT Agreement, with JT Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or JT Pharma, to acquire JT Pharma’s kappa opioid agonist peptide, TP-2021, for use in combination with our ProNeura long-term, continuous drug delivery technology for the treatment of chronic pruritus and other potential medical applications. Under the terms of the JT Agreement, JT Pharma received a $15,000 closing payment and is entitled to receive future milestone payments, payable in cash or in stock, based on the achievement of regulatory milestones, and single-digit percentage earn-out payments on net sales of the product if successfully developed and approved for commercialization. In January 2022, in connection with our entry into a clarification agreement with JT Pharma, we made the first milestone payment under the JT Agreement of $100,000 and issued 51,021 shares of our common stock related to the successful completion of a proof-of-concept study in an animal model.
Knight
 
Pursuant to an agreement (as amended, the Knight Agreement), we granted Knight Therapeutics Inc., or Knight, an exclusive license to commercialize Probuphine in Canada as well as a right of first negotiation in the event we intend to license commercialization rights to any other products in Canada. We are entitled to receive royalty payments from Knight on net sales of Probuphine in Canada ranging in percentage from the low-teens to the mid-thirties. In addition, we agreed to be the exclusive supplier of Probuphine to Knight subject to a supply agreement between us and Knight. During the term of the Knight Agreement, we may not commercialize any product in Canada containing buprenorphine that is intended for a treatment duration of six months or more.
 
Unless earlier terminated, the initial term of the Knight Agreement will expire on the 15th anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of Probuphine for opioid addiction in Canada, which occurred during the fourth quarter of 2018. If Probuphine is approved for another indication in Canada after the fifth anniversary of the first commercial sale of Probuphine for opioid addiction in Canada, we must negotiate in good faith whether to extend the initial term. After the initial term, the Knight Agreement will automatically renew for two-year periods until either party provides the other party with written notice of its intent not to renew at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the initial term or then-current term. We or Knight may terminate the Knight Agreement in the event that (i) either party determines in good faith that it is not advisable for Knight to continue to commercialize Probuphine in Canada as a result of a bona fide safety issue, (ii) the other party has filed for bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or (iii) the other party materially breached the agreement and has not cured such breach within a specified time period. In addition, subject to certain exceptions and requirements, we may terminate the Knight Agreement (i) if Knight discontinues the commercial sale of Probuphine for a period of at least three months and fails to resume sales within the specified cure period, or (ii) in the event that Knight commences any legal proceedings seeking to challenge the validity or ownership of any of our patents related to Probuphine.
 
In the event of termination, among other things, Knight shall (i) cease commercialization of Probuphine in Canada, (ii) transfer title to all current and pending regulatory submissions and regulatory approvals for Probuphine to us and (iii) pay any royalty payments generated by Knight’s sales of Probuphine in Canada due to us.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, patent protection may not afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents.

We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management and research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which may not be patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 
In June 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, issued a patent covering methods of using Probuphine for the treatment of opiate addiction. Titan is the owner of this patent which claims a method for treating opiate addiction with a subcutaneously implanted device comprising buprenorphine and EVA, a biocompatible copolymer that releases buprenorphine continuously for extended periods of time. This patent will expire in April 2024. We have filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty patent application to the use of a kappa-opioid receptor agonist implant for the treatment of pruritus.
 
We also have pending patent applications in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan and Mexico for implants for release of lipophilic or amphiphilic pharmaceutical substances, and for loadable porous structures for use as implants. We also have pending patent applications in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, and South Africa for implants with reduced initial burst.
 
We have additional patents for a heterogeneous implant designed with some unique properties that may provide benefits to the structural integrity of the implants and potentially enhance drug delivery. Patents for this heterogeneous implant have been granted in the U.S., Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, and South Africa.
 
Future court decisions or changes in patent law might materially affect the patents or patent applications, including, but not limited to, their expiration dates.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our product development programs are currently in non-clinical stages of development and once these commence clinical development we can assess and provide details on specific competitive environment.
Manufacturing
 
Ongoing formulation development is conducted at a dedicated facility established at Southwest Research Institute, or SwRI®, in San Antonio, Texas that includes cGMP manufacturing and testing capabilities. We also receive support services from the vast array of SwRI groups with expertise in manufacturing and material sciences. The facilities are compliant with both FDA and Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, requirements enabling us to work with controlled substances, and the manufacturing scale is ideal for product development during non-clinical and clinical testing stages.
 
Manufacturing of Probuphine was primarily conducted at DPT Laboratories, Inc., or DPT, pursuant to a commercial manufacturing agreement with DPT that governed the terms of the production and supply of Probuphine for the U.S., Canada and EU. In October 2020, we entered into Debt Settlement and Release Agreement, or DSRA, which transferred the manufacturing facility at DPT to L. Molteni & C. Dei Frattelli Alitti Societa Di Esercizio S.P.A., or Molteni. Under the agreement, we retain access to the facility, through Molteni, for the manufacture and supply of Probuphine to Knight for Canada.

Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labelling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and devices under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, or FDCA. Drugs and devices are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Products composed of both a drug product and device product are deemed combination products. If marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product’s primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of some of our product candidates, we expect the primary mode of action to be attributable to the drug component of the product, which means that the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research would have primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and includes the following:
 

☐ | Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug;
--+------------------------------------------------


☐ | A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | Potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The nonclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. These nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completion. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 
Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, a manufacturer may need to recall a product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
