Overview
We are a late-stage clinical biotechnology company advancing the design and development of biotherapeutics based on synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is the application of engineering principles in the design of biological systems, genetic circuits and molecular components. We apply the power of synthetic biology to medicine, combining precision engineering with rational drug development to produce Synthetic Biotics: living probiotics genetically engineered to deliver therapeutic benefit.

We believe that this approach confers advantages in the design, development and commercialization of new medicines. Our drug candidates are designed through precise engineering to target validated biological pathways known in the pathophysiology of a given disease. Our current pipeline includes drug candidates that are all orally administered, based on the probiotic chassis of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, which has more than one hundred years of human dosing experience. The activity of our drug candidates is restricted to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, avoiding systemic exposure and associated risks that limit the success of other modalities. Our drug candidates are also designed to be non-colonizing, and fully reversible via GI clearance. These attributes have allowed us to advance the development of potential medicines for both rare and common diseases, with a focus on metabolic and immunological indications. Our platform leverages manufacturing processes with familiar foundations, including fermentation and lyophilization, facilitating process design and scale-up, combined with unique and proprietary innovations tailored to our unique products.
 
Since our founding, based upon technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2014, we have progressed our Synthetic Biotics to a pipeline of multiple drug candidates across different stages, including:
 •SYNB1934 has successfully completed its Phase 2 study. We expect to start a pivotal, Phase 3 study of SYNB1934 for the treatment of patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) in the first half of 2023;
 •SYNB8802, a potential treatment for enteric hyperoxaluria, a well-recognized cause of recurrent kidney stones, has demonstrated clinical proof of concept through a Phase 1b study in patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery;
 •SYNB1353, which was designed to consume methionine as a potential treatment for homocystinuria (HCU), has achieved proof of mechanism in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers and will be advancing towards a Phase 2 study; 
 •SYNB2081, which was announced as a drug candidate for gout this year, and is currently in IND-enabling studies; and
 •Our preclinical research focusing on immunological opportunities such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
 



Strategy
Our mission is to treat diseases underserved by other modalities by researching, developing and commercializing a new class of medicines through the application of synthetic biology to therapeutics. We intend to become a differentiated, global biopharmaceutical company through our approach to Synthetic Biotics. Our near-term priorities include advancing SYNB1934 through Synpheny-3, our pivotal, Phase 3 trial. We are also advancing our earlier-stage pipeline, while continually optimizing our approach to drug discovery, development and manufacturing.
 
Elements of our strategy include:

•Advancing our rare metabolic portfolio, including SYNB1934 for PKU and SYNB1353 for HCU, through clinical development, registration and commercialization. Since our formation, we have established expertise in rare metabolic disorders, and specifically inborn errors of metabolism. Designing our Synthetic Biotics has entailed increasing knowledge of disease biology in diseases like PKU and HCU. Through our development work to date, we have established strong connections with the patient and clinician communities, a crucial requirement in drug development and commercialization in rare diseases. Given this investment, we believe that we are best suited to lead activities for late-stage development through commercialization for our rare metabolic portfolio. For PKU, this includes initiation and execution of Synpheny-3, a pivotal Phase 3 study for SYNB1934, and for HCU, this includes advancing SYNB1353 to a Phase 2 study.
 
•Progressing additional programs through clinical development via strategic partnerships: In 2022, we achieved proof of concept for SYNB8802, in development for enteric hyperoxaluria, a well-recognized cause of recurrent kidney stones. During 2022 we also announced the naming of SYNB2081, a Synthetic Biotic designed to metabolize uric acid as a potential biotherapeutic for gout, which is currently in IND-enabling studies. We believe that both of these product candidates present compelling opportunities to help patients in significant need of new treatment options. We also believe that the programs would be best enabled in partnership with organizations with clinical and regulatory experience and expertise in relevant therapeutic areas, which would be complementary to our expertise on the Synthetic Biotic platform, and benefit from the progress we continue to make in the rare metabolic space. 
 
•Optimizing the potential of Synthetic Biotics: We continually build on our leadership position in biotherapeutics based on synthetic biology. We add to our expertise in design, optimization, and manufacturing to ensure that we are advancing the best possible Synthetic Biotics to address serious medical needs. We pursue this internally, and through select collaborations such as those currently in place with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Roche Basel) and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche US, and together with Roche Basel, Roche) and Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc. (Ginkgo). In 2019, we entered a collaboration with Ginkgo to discover additional preclinical assets, combining our approach to Synthetic Biotics with Ginkgo’s Codebase and Foundry services. This collaboration has since resulted in SYNB1353 for HCU and SYNB2081 for gout. In 2021, we entered into a Pilot Collaboration and Option Agreement with Roche for the discovery of a novel Synthetic Biotic for an undisclosed novel target in IBD. During 2021, we received the upfront, nonrefundable technology access fee due under the terms of the agreement and achieved the first milestone payment for the completion of the research and development services for the first phase of the research plan. During 2022, we received a second milestone payment. We may opportunistically enter into collaborations around certain targets, product candidates or disease areas to maximize their market potential and expand our capabilities.
 
We are supported by our Board of Directors and our Scientific Advisory Board, each of which offers complementary experience in drug discovery and development, as well as expertise in building public companies, management, commercialization, and business development. Our founding science came from the laboratories of MIT professors James Collins and Timothy Lu, who remain engaged in guiding development and application of our product engine as members of our Scientific Advisory Board.
 

Our Pipeline: Synthetic Biotics in Clinical Development
 
Our current clinical-stage pipeline consists of drug candidates targeting significant medical needs caused by an underlying metabolic disorder. These include SYNB1934, which we expect to enter a pivotal, Phase 3 study in PKU in the first half of 2023, and drug candidates designed to treat HCU, enteric hyperoxaluria, and gout. Our preclinical work includes additional metabolic disease research, target exploration, and focused efforts on immunology, specifically IBD.
Clinical Pipeline: Metabolic Diseases
 
Metabolic diseases are disorders resulting from defects or alterations in how our bodies break down or produce important metabolites or molecules. These can be caused by a genetic mutation, such as PKU or HCU, or organ dysfunction, such as enteric hyperoxaluria, or a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors, as is the case with gout. In patients with these diseases, the absence of certain enzymes causes metabolites to accumulate in the GI tract and systemically throughout the body. In patients with PKU and HCU, these metabolites can build up to toxic levels, resulting in life-threatening medical risks and/or serious complications.
Our PKU Program
 
In October 2022, based on the positive findings of the Synpheny-1 Phase 2 study, we confirmed that SYNB1934 would be the drug candidate to enter Synpheny-3, a pivotal, Phase 3 study expected to commence in the first half of 2023. SYNB1934 is an orally administered, non-systemically absorbed drug candidate based on the probiotic E. coli Nissle, genetically engineered to metabolize Phe. Findings to date support SYNB1934’s potential to be an efficacious, safe, convenient, orally-administered medical option that can be used regardless of age, or genotype of PKU and can be used for both monotherapy or adjunctive treatment option. In January 2023, we announced that SYNB1934 was granted Rare Pediatric Drug Designation (RPDD) by the FDA. Prior to confirming SYNB1934 as the lead candidate, we developed a first-generation PKU drug candidate, SYNB1618, through Phase 2 studies. SYNB1618 received both Orphan Drug and Fast Track designations by the FDA, and a positive opinion for orphan designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We expect to receive these designations for SYNB1934 given its similarity as a more potent version of SYNB1618.
 
The Science of PKU
 
PKU is an inherited metabolic disease that causes the amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to build up in the body. Phe is found in the natural protein contained in foods including all meat and dairy products, most beans, grains and potatoes, as well as some artificial sweeteners. People with PKU have inherited genetic defects in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme, which is required to break down Phe, resulting in potentially neurotoxic levels. Uncontrolled Phe levels during childhood can interfere with normal brain development, causing permanent developmental disabilities, and severely elevated Phe levels at any age can result in neurocognitive symptoms such as slower cognition, difficulty concentrating or “brain fog.”


To reduce the risk of complications in PKU patients requires lifelong control of Phe levels. During the 1960’s, countries began newborn screening to ensure that Phe control was implemented immediately through a highly restrictive, low-Phe diet to avoid permanent, severe intellectual disability. Per EU and U.S. guidelines, any newborn infant with a plasma Phe concentration of >400–600 μM should be started on a low-Phe diet as soon as possible. The diet includes extreme restrictions of natural foods to keep daily protein at levels that can be as low as 4-6 grams per day, This generally includes elimination of all sources of animal protein and dairy, legumes and nuts, and limited intake of bread, pasta, rice and some vegetables. Low-protein bread and pasta products made from starch are used to provide needed energy. The dietary regimen required also includes the addition of amino acid-based, Phe-free formula or other specific medical foods to provide adequate protein, vitamins, minerals and energy.
 
It is extremely challenging to adhere to this restricted diet. Particular challenges arise during times of increasing independence during adolescence. Access to low protein foods can pose difficulties as they are costlier and less nutritious than their higher protein, non-modified equivalents, and the needed formula can also be costly or otherwise difficult to access. As a result, the vast majority of people living with PKU, and especially adults living independently, have Phe levels well above the recognized targets.

It is estimated that there are more than 150,000 people diagnosed with PKU living across the United States, Europe and Asia. They are typically diagnosed through newborn screening. Of these, the vast majority remain untreated, reflecting limitations of current treatment options.
 
Limitations of Current PKU Treatment Options
 
There are currently two medications that have been approved by the FDA, EMA, and other regulatory agencies globally as medical treatments for PKU based on safety and efficacy in reduction of plasma Phe levels. These approved medications provide precedents for clinical development and regulatory processes, yet have different limitations that we believe leave significant need for a new medical treatment approach for PKU, as outlined below:

•Sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan®), a biopterin, was approved by the FDA in 20117, and is now as a generic in the United States and other markets in tablet and sachet formulations. Prior to genericization, Kuvan generated ~$500 million per year globally for Biomarin, despite use by only an estimated 15% of U.S. patients. Now, where available, a trial of sapropterin is standard of care for infants diagnosed with PKU, and those that respond with a sufficient reduction in Phe will remain on lifelong sapropterin treatment. However, we believe a significant proportion of sapropterin-responsive patients would still benefit from additional Phe-lowering, and we see this segment as an important opportunity for SYNB1934 as an adjunctive medical treatment option. 
 
•Palynziq® Injection (pegvaliase-pqpz) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for adult patients with PKU and uncontrolled blood Phe. Due to instability and other complexities, the PAH enzyme that is impaired in PKU is not a viable candidate for enzyme replacement therapy. Palynziq is a pegylated form of recombinant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), a non-mammalian enzyme that also metabolizes Phe. Safety considerations include risk of severe allergic reactions, including a 10% risk of anaphylaxis, resulting in FDA labeling that includes a boxed warning and requirement to carry auto-injectable epinephrine at all times while they are taking the medication. Despite these challenges, Palynziq generated $255 million in 2022, largely from the United States, despite maintaining an estimated ~10% market share. 
 

Given the limitations of sapropterin in terms of responder rates, and the safety challenges of Palynziq, we believe the approved therapies’ limitations leave a large majority of those living with PKU in need of an orally-administered medical treatment option that provides Phe-lowering efficacy with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. We believe that SYNB1934, as a potentially safe, orally dosed product that provides significant and sustained reductions in Phe levels, and as both a monotherapy or adjunctive medical treatment option, could meet that need.
 


SYNB1934 for PKU
 
Our approach to designing a Synthetic Biotic to metabolize Phe is based on a strain of E. coli Nissle engineered to metabolize Phe as it transits through the GI tract, thereby targeting both Phe from dietary sources, and Phe that has circulated to the GI tract via enterorecirculation. Phe metabolism is done through the addition of Phe-consuming L-amino acid deaminase (LAAD) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) enzymes. The strains were also designed to produce a Phe transporter, PheP, which brings Phe into the cell, where it is metabolized by PAL. It is provided to patients as a sachet containing a lyophilized powder formulation, to be mixed with water and taken with meals, three times a day. This product presentation is familiar to PKU patients, as sapropterin is provided as a sachet, and often their nutritional supplemental formula requires mixing with liquid.
 




SYNB1934 was engineered as a next-generation version of first-generation PKU drug candidate SYNB1618, by modifying five amino acids in PAL, which increased productivity of PAL’s conversion of Phe to the metabolic byproduct trans-Cinnamic acid (TCA). A detailed description of the engineering of SYNB1618 and data from preclinical studies in an animal model of disease and healthy non-human primates was published in 2018 (Nat. Biotechnol. 36, 857–864 (2018)), and an overview of the engineering and early development of SYNB1934 was published in 2021 (Nat Commun. 12, 6215 (2021)).

In Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers, both SYNB1618 and SYNB1934 have been found to be safe and well-tolerated at doses up to 2x1012 live cells administered three times a day for seven days. Higher doses were associated with mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly nausea and vomiting. In July 2019, we announced data that demonstrated that SYNB1618 was safe and well-tolerated and achieved proof-of-mechanism of strain activity in both healthy volunteers and patients with PKU. Improved tolerability of the lyophilized SYNB1618 over the early liquid formulation enabled us to determine a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) to take forward to test in patients. In September 2021, we announced that Phase 1 results in healthy volunteers and predictive modeling indicate SYNB1934 may have greater potency than SYNB1618.

In October 2022, we shared positive top-line results from the Phase 2 Synpheny-1 study that demonstrated proof of concept in PKU patients for both candidates, and confirmed greater potency of SYNB1934 in PKU patients, the candidate that we have selected to advance to pivotal Phase 3 studies. The complete results were presented at the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (SIMD) Annual Meeting in March 2023. Results presented included successfully meeting the primary endpoint (change in area under the curve of D5-Phe following a meal challenge) for SYNB1618 and SYNB1934. The study also confirmed greater activity in PKU patients for SYNB1934, the next-generation Synthetic Biotic designed to consume Phe, as compared to first-generation candidate SYNB1618. Results for SYNB1934 included a -40% mean reduction in plasma Phe levels for SYNB1934, and -53% among those considered responders (with >20% reduction from baseline). 60% of patients achieved the >20% criteria for Phe reduction considered the threshold for a clinically meaningful response. The study also included experience with both candidates when provided in combination for patients who were already taking sapropterin (Kuvan) at baseline, indicating the potential for adjunctive medical treatment. Safety and tolerability findings were consistent with prior experience and favorable, with no serious adverse events (SAE) across the PKU program, and those adverse events that did occur being predominantly GI in nature.




To date, the PKU program has included >240 individuals dosed across four clinical trials. We anticipate starting Synpheny-3, the pivotal Phase 3 study of SYNB1934 as a potential treatment for PKU, in the first half of 2023. We expect that the design for this trial will build on the successful precedents provided by the two therapeutics that have already been approved by regulators as treatments for Phe-lowering in PKU. Both of those currently approved medicines were approved based on a single, registrational study, with Phe-reduction as a primary endpoint, and share a similar, three-part structure to the design of their Phase 3 trials. Synpheny-3 is expected to include both adults and adolescent patients between ages 12-18 years of age. We anticipate a separate study will be needed to support use in patients under 12 years of age.

We are pursuing broad US and Ex-US patent protection for SYNB1934, including composition of matter patent exclusivity to 2041, composition of matter directed to the engineered bacterium and its drug formulation, and methods of treatment and administration & manufacturing methods. Coverage will continue to grow as the program progresses.
 
Our HCU Program
 
In November 2021 we announced the nomination of SYNB1353, a novel, orally administered, non-systemically absorbed drug candidate designed to lower plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) in patients with HCU by consuming methionine, a precursor to Hcy, in the GI tract. We also shared at that time that mechanistic modeling data suggests that SYNB1353 may lower plasma Hcy by up to 58% and may increase protein intake in HCU patients.
 
In November 2022, we announced that proof of mechanism was achieved with SYNB1353 through positive results in the Phase 1 study of healthy volunteers using a dietary model of HCU. SYNB1353 has received Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations from the FDA as a potential treatment for HCU.


Science of HCU

HCU is a rare inherited metabolic disorder that affects the metabolism of the amino acid methionine (Met), a protein found in many foods including meat, fish, and dairy products. HCU is caused by a genetic defect which results in the absence of an enzyme known as cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). When CBS is absent, Hcy and other toxic chemicals and their byproducts, including Met, build up in the blood and urine. In HCU, elevated total homocysteine (tHcy) levels are associated with a multisystem disorder, including impairments of the eye (ectopia lentis and/or severe myopia), skeletal system (excessive height, long limbs, scoliosis, pectus excavatum), vascular system (thromboembolism), and CNS (development delay and intellectual disability). The goal in treating HCU is to reduce and control levels of tHcy, thereby reducing risk of acute, potentially life-threatening blood clots and chronic, multisystem complications.



There is currently no cure for HCU and treatment options are limited. Patients must follow a rigid diet low in protein to avoid dietary Met intake. Other therapeutic approaches include vitamin supplements to minimize some of the disease side effects. Approximately 5,000 individuals in the United States and Europe suffer from CBS or “Classical” HCU.
 
Limitations of Current HCU Treatments
 
Approved pharmacological treatment options for HCU are limited due to efficacy and tolerability. People with more mild phenotypes of HCU typically respond effectively to, and are sufficiently managed by, taking Vitamin B6 (also known as pyridoxine-responsive). Non-responders require a combination of betaine (brand name Cystadane®) and a moderate to severe dietary Met restriction. The severely protein-restricted diet is complex and challenging to adhere to. Compliance with treatment often deteriorates, particularly in adolescence, as in other disorders requiring dietary adherence. Patients report significant challenges with the burden of the low protein diet, intake of amino acid mixtures, and the palatability of protein substitutes as well as betaine. Reaching tHcy treatment targets remains a challenge despite existing pharmacotherapies.


SYNB1353 for HCU
 
A diet low in Met, a precursor to Hcy, is standard treatment for lowering tHcy levels in patients with HCU. This dietary model provided the scientific rationale for SYNB1353, which was engineered to produce an enzymatic pathway to metabolize Met, and thus lower plasma levels of tHcy. SYNB1353 metabolizes Met via the methionine decarboxylase (MetDC) enzymatic pathway, which prevents the conversion of Met into Hcy, thereby lowering tHcy in HCU patients and reducing risk of complications. SYNB1353 is taken as an orally administered, non-systemically absorbed live biotherapeutic drug candidate that, like our PKU drug candidates, is provided as a lyophilized powder in a sachet, to be orally administered with meals three times a day. We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to SYNB1353, which was developed as part of our research collaboration with Ginkgo.



In November 2022, we announced that proof of mechanism was achieved with SYNB1353 through positive results in the Phase 1 study of healthy volunteers using a dietary model of HCU. Top-line results demonstrated that SYNB1353 reduced in plasma Met when measured over 24 hours as area under the curve (AUC) following a Met meal challenge. SYNB1353 was generally well tolerated, and adverse events (AEs) were all mild to moderate, transient, and predominantly GI in nature. The frequency and severity of GI-related AEs were similar in the active and control group. During 2023, we plan to continue to progress development of SYNB1353 towards a Phase 2 study in patients with HCU.
 
Our Enteric Hyperoxaluria Program
 
SYNB8802 is a novel, orally administered, non-systemically absorbed drug candidate being developed for the treatment of enteric hyperoxaluria, a chronic, progressive disease characterized by high levels of urinary oxalate (Uox), a well-recognized cause of recurrent kidney stones.

Enteric hyperoxaluria often occurs as a result of a primary insult to the bowel, such as Crohn’s disease, short bowel syndrome, or surgical procedures such as Roux-en-Y bariatric weight-loss surgery. This results in GI malabsorption, causing increased absorption of oxalate across the GI tract into the circulation. Oxalate crystals can damage kidneys, leading to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are no approved treatments for enteric hyperoxaluria. SYNB8802 was designed using precision genetic engineering of E. coli Nissle to lower Uox levels by consuming oxalate through the addition of three different enzymes, which together convert oxalate to the byproduct formate. In 2021, we reported positive proof-of-mechanism for SYNB8802 from a Phase 1b study that demonstrated lowering of urinary and fecal oxalate levels in healthy volunteers with diet-induced hyperoxaluria, and in December 2022, we announced proof of concept based on the lowering of Uox in patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.



Science of Enteric Hyperoxaluria
 
Hyperoxaluria is a disease which results from excessive levels of oxalate in the body. Oxalate can be found naturally in the body or in foods with high oxalate levels such as leafy greens, potatoes, almonds, coffee, and beans. Humans do not have an inherent physiological need for oxalate and it is normally excreted through the kidney. Excessive levels of oxalate, when present in the urine, bind with calcium in the kidney and lead to nephrolithiasis (kidney stone formation), nephrocalcinosis, chronic kidney complications and renal disease.
 
There is a direct link between elevated Uox and increased probability of kidney stone events or other renal adverse outcomes in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Even modest reductions in Uox can reduce the odds of developing a kidney stone. A recent epidemiological study conducted in 297 patients with enteric hyperoxaluria demonstrated that a 20% reduction in Uox resulted in as much as a 25% reduction in the annual risk of having a kidney stone in the subsequent year in patients with recurrent kidney stones (D’Costa, Nephrol Dial Transplant 2020).
 
The vast majority of hyperoxaluria cases are idiopathic, or of unknown origin. A small percentage are caused by rare, genetic disorders, and an estimated 12% of highly recurrent kidney stone formers generate oxalate stones due to a clear enteric etiology. Conditions that commonly result in enteric hyperoxaluria include inflammatory bowel disease, certain kinds of bariatric surgery, short bowel syndrome, cystic fibrosis and celiac disease.
 
There are currently few approved treatments for primary hyperoxaluria, a rare genetic disease wherein the liver produces excessive levels of oxalate. Approved treatments for primary hyperoxaluria target the liver, and thus are not beneficial to patients with enteric hyperoxaluria, given its etiology is in GI malabsorption, and not hepatic over-production.
 
Based on qualitative market research and analyses using real world evidence, we estimate that there are 200,000 to 300,000 patients with recurrent kidney stones due to enteric hyperoxaluria in the United States. Currently there are no approved pharmacological therapies for the reduction of oxalate levels in the urine in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. Existing treatment options are generally non-specific and include high fluid intake to increase urine output to more than two to three liters per day, a diet low in salt and oxalate, oral citrate and/or calcium and/or magnesium supplementation. We believe a clear need exists for therapies that lower dangerously high levels of Uox to reduce the risk of recurrent kidney stones in this patient population.



SYNB8802 and Enteric Hyperoxaluria

In May 2020, we announced the nomination of a clinical candidate for enteric hyperoxaluria, SYNB8802, which was designed using precision genetic engineering of E. coli Nissle to lower Uox levels by consuming oxalate throughout the GI tract.


In vivo studies in both mice and non-human primates demonstrated that SYNB8802 decreased Uox levels in an acute model of hyperoxaluria induced by dietary intervention. A detailed description of the engineering of SYNB8802 and data from these preclinical studies in an animal model of disease and healthy non-human primates was published in Molecular Systems Biology (Lubkowicz et al 2022).

In 2021, we reported positive proof-of-mechanism for SYNB8802 from a Phase 1a study that demonstrated -29% lowering of Uox and significant fecal oxalate lowering in healthy volunteers with diet-induced hyperoxaluria. In December 2022, we shared data confirming that SYNB8802 demonstrated proof of concept through clinically significant -38% lowering of Uox in a Phase 1b study in patients with a history of gastric bypass surgery.
 


SYNB8802 has the potential to be the first approved medical treatment for enteric hyperoxaluria. Our approach will be to target an enriched, high risk patient population who represent the greatest unmet medical need due to a history of highly recurrent kidney stones due to enteric hyperoxaluria. Our focus in 2023 is to advance development activities with a focus on formulation and dose frequency evaluation, prior to a future registrational Phase 3 study utilizing a clinical endpoint that incorporates kidney stone formation and/or events.

Our Gout Program

SYNB2081 is a Synthetic Biotic designed to consume uric acid in the GI tract with the goal of lowering systemic uric acid levels as a potential treatment for gout, a complex form of inflammatory arthritis. Current treatment options present limitations in both safety and efficacy. SYNB2081 presents a novel, orally administered, non-systemically absorbed drug candidate created through our research collaboration with Ginkgo, the leading horizontal platform for cell programming.
Science of Gout

Gout occurs when excess uric acid in the body forms crystals in the joints. Patients can experience symptoms such as intense joint pain, inflammation and redness, and limited range of motion in the affected joints due to excessive levels of uric acid. In

addition, gout is a recognized risk factor in chronic kidney disease. Due to present limitations in current treatment options, we believe that there is a clear need for a new approach.
 
Gout Development Plan
 
In August 2022 we announced SYNB2081 as our drug candidate for the potential treatment of gout and the second product to advance to clinical development through our collaboration with Ginkgo. Our plan is to continue moving SYNB2081 to the next stage of our drug development pipeline. SYNB2081 is currently in IND-enabling studies.
Additional Pipeline Programs in Metabolic & Immunological Diseases

The Synthetic Biotic approach is well-suited for disease targets that are associated with validated biological pathways in metabolic and immunological diseases. For metabolic diseases, we have applied learnings across our programs in PKU, HCU, enteric hyperoxaluria and gout. In immunological diseases, we are focused on opportunities to address the significant need for new treatment modalities in IBD.

IBD is a group of diseases characterized by significant local inflammation in the GI tract typically driven by T cells, activated macrophages and compromised function of the epithelial barrier. IBD pathogenesis is linked to both genetic and environmental factors and may be caused by altered interactions between gut microbes and the intestinal immune system. Compromised gut barrier function also plays a central role in autoimmune diseases pathogenesis. A single layer of epithelial cells separates the luminal contents of the gut from the host circulatory system and the immune cells in the body. Disrupting the epithelial layer can lead to pathological exposure of foreign antigens from the lumen resulting in increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders. The interplay between the gut microbiota and the host is thought to play a key role in the maintenance of the epithelial barrier as well as homeostatic immunity. Thus, enhancing barrier function and reducing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract are potential therapeutic mechanisms for the treatment or prevention of autoimmune disorders. Our Synthetic Biotic platform allows for the effective programming of E. coli Nissle to execute these functions, including the metabolic production of factors such as short chain fatty acids to enhance barrier function, and secreting proteins, such as immunomodulatory cytokines.
 
Current approaches to treat IBD are focused on therapeutics that modulate the immune system and suppress inflammation. These therapies include steroids, such as prednisone, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, such as Humira®(adalimumab). However, these approaches are associated with systemic immunosuppression, which includes greater susceptibility to infectious diseases and cancer. According to the CDC, in 2015 an estimated three million adults in the United States are reported as being diagnosed with IBD. In June 2021, we entered into a research collaboration agreement with Roche for the discovery of a novel Synthetic Biotic for the treatment of IBD. In addition, we continue to advance additional, wholly-owned preclinical research efforts in IBD.

Among immune conditions, working to treat IBD allows us to leverage knowledge and expertise gained from our oral metabolic programs to develop living medicines that can act locally at the site of disease in the gut. Because our approach is based on local delivery to the site of inflammation and not on systemic administration, we anticipate that our Synthetic Biotics may offer an attractive safety profile in this therapeutic category, where safety is a particularly desirable attribute in a product profile compared to options available today.
 
We developed a portfolio of Synthetic Biotics to treat certain cancers which were designed to modify the tumor microenvironment, activate the immune system and result in tumor reduction. These Synthetic Biotics could be used in combination with other cancer therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our Synthetic Biotic clinical immuno-oncology (IO) candidate was SYNB1891, an intratumorally administered Synthetic Biotic medicine engineered to act as a dual innate and adaptive immune activator. On November 10, 2021, we announced that our Phase 1 trial of SYNB1891 in combination with PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma had completed enrollment. No further studies are planned for SYNB1891 and we are focusing our research and development efforts specifically on metabolic and immunological diseases.
 
Designing and Developing Synthetic Biotics

Synthetic Biotics have unique advantages as potentially safe, effective, orally administered biotherapeutics. Engineered microbes can be programmed to carry out functions that cannot be performed by conventional drug treatments, such as small molecules or antibodies. Unlike other targeted approaches such as gene or RNA-targeted therapies, Synthetic Biotics are reversible, as they are engineered to be non-colonizing and are rapidly cleared via excretion. They have a reduced risk of adverse events due to the lack of systemic absorption.
Using Synthetic Biology to Generate Synthetic Biotics

Bacteria have evolved over millions of years to adapt, survive, and actively metabolize to consume or produce metabolites in the human body. They are also amenable to genetic manipulation. To confer a therapeutic effect, we use basic biological properties of bacteria and the tools of synthetic biology to develop Synthetic Biotics from non-pathogenic microbes, focusing initially on a single strain of the bacteria E. coli Nissle.
 
Our scientists genetically engineer probiotic, non-pathogenic bacteria to create biological circuits to direct cellular processes in a manner analogous to designing electrical circuits. We aim to precisely and appropriately control the amount, location and activity of our Synthetic Biotics to address specific diseases and target biology of interest.
 
The critical parts of an engineered Synthetic Biotic medicine include (1) the “chassis,” or non-pathogenic bacterium, (2) the effector module, which is a gene or pathway encoding the core biological activity that provides the therapeutic function, and (3) tunable switches to precisely determine the circumstances under which the effector module will be active, as well as the potency, performance and output of the effectors themselves.




1.The Chassis: Our Synthetic Biotic platform starts with a well-characterized probiotic to serve as the chassis upon which we build our living medicines. Our research and development programs use E. coli Nissle, which is one of many non-pathogenic probiotics isolated from the human microbiota. E. coli Nissle is non-colonizing and has been used as a probiotic bacterial supplement for many years to promote gut health. Clinical studies have demonstrated that E. coli Nissle is rapidly cleared from most individuals with no significant safety issues (Clin. Transl. Sci. (2017) 00, 1—8). We also observed complete clearance from subjects in our Phase 1 clinical trial of SYNB1618 in healthy volunteers (Puurunen et al 2021 Nature Metabolism 3; 1125-1132). We believe E. coli Nissle's widespread use as a probiotic is evidence of its utility as a safe background chassis to apply synthetic biology to confer a therapeutic benefit. There are several additional features of E. coli Nissle organism that makes it an attractive chassis for our platform:
 
•E. coli Nissle’s genetic and metabolic machinery are well understood and provide a robust cellular context into which genetic information can be introduced with high efficiency and little or no damage to the fitness of the bacterium. 
 
•The advanced nature of the synthetic biology toolkit available for E. coli Nissle enables rapid iterative design, assembly, and testing of prototype product candidates and remains unique among other bacterial and cellular engineering approaches.
 
•Starting from known principles of manufacturing helps de-risk Synlogic’s proprietary large-scale manufacturing platform.
 •As a Gram-negative bacterium, with a protective outer wall, E. coli Nissle survives well in the human GI tract.
 
2.The Effector Module or Circuit: Synthetic Biotics have the advantage that they can be designed with multiple pathway components. We have engineered integration systems to direct stable insertion of multiple genetic circuits and pathways 


into optimal chromosomal locations, or “landing pads,” of E. coli Nissle. This enables efficient and stable expression of multiple genes encoding enzymes and other proteins. Our approach allows us to engineer two types of mechanistic activities into our Synthetic Biotics: 1) we can engineer Synthetic Biotics capable of metabolic transformations that can substitute or compensate for missing or defective pathways in a patient, and 2) we can engineer Synthetic Biotics to produce therapeutically beneficial molecules.
 
 The enzymatic pathways needed to produce or consume molecules are protected from the harsh GI environment by their location within the cell cytoplasm of E. coli Nissle, allowing them the potential to function throughout the GI tract. We have leveraged proprietary tools, know-how and intellectual property to build multiple Synthetic Biotics that produce therapeutically relevant effects in pre-clinical experiments. Progression of these product candidates in diseases with high unmet need is based on prioritizing those with feasible drug development paths in terms of availability of informative animal models and existence of biomarkers to guide efficient clinical development.
 

3.Tunable Switches: We also design and engineer proprietary switches to control the activity of the genetic pathways we introduce into our Synthetic Biotics, with the goal of controlling the engineered circuit or its therapeutic output. To optimize the fitness and activity of a Synthetic Biotic, it is critical that the effector is activated at the appropriate time and place to mediate its function. Switches are based on engineering DNA elements called “inducible promoters” that are designed to respond to disease states, specific environmental signals, or exogenously added inducing molecules. Our goal is to design and develop Synthetic Biotics programmed with switches to produce therapeutic effects at precisely the right time and location such as the anaerobic environment of the gut, or in the context of local inflammation or other pathogenic factors.
 
Advantages of Synthetic Biotic Biotherapeutics
 
We believe our Synthetic Biotics will provide safe and effective therapies given the following attributes:
 1.Synthetic Biotics Have Potential to Address Unmet Needs Not Possible with Other Modalities

Degrading Toxic Metabolites: Unlike other therapeutic approaches, Synthetic Biotics can be programmed with a unique mechanistic activity. In internal metabolic programs, we are engineering Synthetic Biotics with entire pathways designed to degrade or “consume” toxic metabolites. We believe that using a metabolizing pathway is advantageous compared to gene, RNA or enzyme replacement therapies because the latter are limited to targeting a single gene or protein defect and may require several unique drug products to address genetically heterogeneous patient populations. Compensating with an entire pathway delivered in bacteria Synthetic Biotics may provide a safe, therapeutic solution to broader disease populations as a single engineered therapeutic. Our clinical stage programs, SYNB1934, SYNB8802 and SYNB1353, are examples of Synthetic Biotics designed and engineered to eliminate metabolites from the GI tract and prevent their absorption. Learnings from these programs are being applied to additional preclinical programs where metabolite dysregulation is relevant to disease.
 
Production of Therapeutic Molecules: Synthetic Biotics can also be programmed to produce beneficial molecules, such as bacterial metabolites that may improve disease or proteins that can be secreted from the bacteria into the local environment. Examples of this approach include production of short chain fatty acids (Reeves et al. DDW 2022), aryl hydrocarbon (AHR) agonists (Shu et al. DDW2022) and secretion of human IL-22 protein (Reeves et al. DDW 2022).
 
Combinations of Mechanisms: By incorporating multiple effectors or enzymes into a single strain, Synthetic Biotics have the potential to address multifactorial disease biology more effectively. For example, Synthetic Biotics can be engineered with multiple enzymes which consume toxic metabolites more effectively than a single effector could otherwise provide. Alternatively, pathways that degrade a metabolite of interest can be engineered into a Synthetic Biotic that also produces one or more therapeutic molecules.
 2.Synthetic Biotics Have Potential to Reduce Safety Risks by Providing Local Therapeutic Delivery 
 
We believe that when delivered locally, Synthetic Biotics have the potential to avoid the risks often associated with systemic therapies, especially when combinations of systemic therapies are required. Our Synthetic Biotic drug candidates are orally administered, and act locally while transiting through the gut. Consequently, they decrease toxic metabolite levels in the blood to provide a systemic therapeutic benefit to the patient. Given the potential for chronic oral dosing, Synthetic Biotics may have benefits in terms of dose prediction and reversibility of activity.
3.The Synthetic Biotic Approach is a Favorable Engine for Pharmacology
 
Features of our Synthetic Biotic product engine enable a highly efficient drug discovery and development with the potential of advancing clinical candidates more rapidly and efficiently than traditional approaches. We have demonstrated the ability to move a program from concept to clinical development within a year, and also to apply learnings across programs to facilitate development. Reasons for this include:
 •E. coli Nissle chassis is used across programs. Because our lead programs are based on E. coli Nissle, experience can be leveraged broadly across the portfolio to further optimize the efficiency and reproducibility of discovery, development and manufacturing efforts. The non-colonizing nature of E. coli Nissle can be combined with engineering approaches to enhance safety in terms of impact on the patient and the environment. E. coli Nissle can be engineered to require a specific exogenous nutrient supplement for growth, which limits the ability to replicate in the human body and environment. By controlling replication, we can control the number of cells being administered to a patient, which limits patient-to-patient variability. Also, dependence on an essential nutritional supplement not available in the environment reduces biocontainment risk.
 •Predictive pharmacology and biomarkers. Synthetic Biotic programs are designed to achieve a target activity and support an iterative design-build-test cycle to improve performance for achieving this target. For example, Synthetic Biotic programs can be optimized by including multiple copies or regulated control of certain genes, by adding transporters for particular substrates or by optimizing enzymes for basic bacterial metabolism. These tools enable rational and iterative engineering cycles in the discovery phase.
 •Biomarkers as indicators of mechanistic and clinical activity may also be engineered into Synthetic Biotics to drive optimization and decision-making. By assessing the activities of our Synthetic Biotic programs using in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, we can model activity in humans. As we progress through clinical studies, we expect our predictive pharmacology models are further refined to inform dosing and development decisions for our additional programs.
 •Stability and manufacturing. Starting from known principles of manufacturing helps de-risk Synlogic’s proprietary large-scale manufacturing platform. Our lead Synthetic Biotic programs have advanced the platform by defining manufacturing processes that can be used for the entire portfolio. Our use of synthetic biology switches permits the precise control of engineered metabolic pathway activation. We use switches to suppress effector activity during manufacturing, enabling development of reproducible processes for biomass generation while maintaining robust and cost-efficient scale up of product candidates.
 •Manufacturing campaigns have demonstrated production reproducibility and robustness at multiple scales. The stability profile of our material has translated through the development and scale up efforts, supporting the shelf life of our strains. The implemented late stage and scale up capabilities have enabled us to produce 10,000 to 15,000 drug product doses at multiple strengths. In March 2022, we invested to expand our current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) clean-room space at the Azzur Group, LLC. The expansion of our in-house manufacturing space allows us to produce scaled up drug substance to support late stage pivotal studies. Our solid formulation capabilities have enabled multiple drug product presentations. Depending on scale, we can manufacture drug product either internally within our in-house facility or externally at a large-scale fill finish CMO. 
Collaboration Agreements
 
To accelerate the development and commercialization of Synthetic Biotics to patients, we have formed, and intend to seek, other opportunities to form strategic alliances with collaborators that can expand our pipeline of therapeutic development and product candidates. We also intend to seek additional opportunities to work with multiple academic, research and translational medicine organizations and entities to deepen our understanding and development of living medicines with the potential to treat disease and disorders.
Roche
 
In June 2021, we entered into a Pilot Collaboration and Option Agreement (the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement) with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd (Roche Basel) and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche US, and together with Roche Basel, Roche). Under the terms of the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement, we and Roche will seek to collaborate to research and pre-clinically develop Synthetic Biotics for addressing an undisclosed novel target for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (the Product Candidate).


Pursuant to the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement, Roche agreed to pay us an upfront, nonrefundable technology access fee of $1.0 million, which we received in July 2021. In August 2022, the Company completed the research and development services for the second phase of the research plan and achieved a milestone payment of $1.5 million, which was paid by Roche in October 2022. We are eligible to receive up to $5.0 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain success criteria. Following the research period, Roche holds an exclusive option right (the Option) to negotiate a definitive Collaboration and License Agreement (CLA) for further development and commercialization of the Product Candidate.
 
Pursuant to the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement, during the term of such agreement, each party has granted to the other party a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free right and license to certain intellectual property and know-how controlled by such party, solely as necessary for the party to perform its obligations under the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement. The parties have established a Joint Research Committee (JRC) to oversee and manage the execution of the underlying study plan for the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement.
 
The Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement includes various representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities, and other customary provisions. Roche may terminate the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement without cause immediately upon written notice where certain success criteria have been met for parts of the study plan, or upon ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to us. Either party may terminate the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the other party.
 
We expect to continue to perform the research and development under the Roche Collaboration and Option Agreement. We have received and are eligible to receive milestone payments from Roche upon the achievement of success criteria for respective milestones.
 Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc.

In June 2019, we entered into an agreement with Ginkgo. The agreement provided an $80 million equity investment at a premium in Synlogic by Ginkgo and entry into a long-term strategic platform collaboration to expand and accelerate the development of Synlogic’s pipeline of Synthetic Biotics. We are using Ginkgo’s cell programming platform to build and test thousands of microbial strains to accelerate progression of early preclinical leads to drug candidates optimized for further clinical development.
 
As part of the agreement, Ginkgo purchased 6,340,771 shares of our common stock and accompanying Pre-Funded Warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants) to purchase up to 2,548,117 shares of our common stock, at a combined price of $9.00 per share and Pre-Funded Warrant. Gross proceeds were approximately $80 million. Under the agreement, we made a prepayment to Ginkgo of $30 million for its foundry services that are being provided to us over an initial term of five years which can be extended. Upon the expiration of such initial term and, if applicable, such additional period, any portion of our prepayment that has not been used to purchase services from Ginkgo will be retained by Ginkgo. We have exclusive rights to any Synthetic Biotics that we develop as part of the collaboration and to intellectual property covering such products.
 
Potential Future Collaborations
 
We believe strategic alliances can be important drivers for accelerating our goal of developing Synthetic Biotics, and we will continue to seek collaborators who can help fund, develop and commercialize our novel therapeutic candidates, particularly in large metabolic and immunological indications. As the potential application of our Synthetic Biotics platform is extremely broad, we also plan to continue to identify academic, research and translational medicine organizations and entities that can contribute expertise and resources to our programs, to allow us to expand our impact more rapidly to broader patient populations.
Intellectual Property and Technology Licenses
 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from our collaborators or other third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
 
We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of synthetic biology. We additionally rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions when available, and are seeking and

plan to rely on additional regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations when applicable. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 
We believe we are well positioned in terms of intellectual property because we:
 
•Have built and expanded, and intend to continue expansion in, a broad worldwide portfolio of intellectual property, including patents and patent applications, in areas relevant to the development, manufacturing and formulation of human therapeutic products using live biotherapeutics based on synthetic biology; and
 •Intend to take additional steps, where appropriate, to further protect our intellectual property rights, including, for example, through the use of copyright and trademark protection, as well as regulatory protection available via orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions.
 
We believe our intellectual property portfolio provides broad coverage of our Synthetic Biotic platform and applicable disease-related technologies. As of March 22, 2023, we had 182 Synlogic-owned patents and patent applications in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, of which 46 have been issued or allowed.
 
Synlogic Intellectual Property
 
Disease-related applications
 
The disease-related applications in our intellectual property portfolio relate to certain pathological conditions including, but not limited to, hyperammonemia, hyperphenylalaninemia, hyperoxaluria, homocystinuria, hyperuricemia, certain other inherited metabolic diseases and conditions, metabolic disorders, diseases and conditions associated with an inflammatory state, diseases associated with gut inflammation, compromised gut mucosal barrier (leaky gut), and various autoimmune disorders and provide coverage for engineered bacteria having genetic circuitry designed to specifically address those conditions and the associated disease states. The intellectual property portfolio provides coverage for engineered bacterial strain compositions, related formulations, methods of making the bacterial strains, methods of measuring strain activity, and methods for treating diseases. Currently, intellectual property relating to this technology includes pending applications in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, as well as several issued U.S. patents directed to composition of matter and pharmaceutical composition claims covering our clinical candidates. The patent term for our current patents and patent applications have expiration dates ranging from December 2035 to December 2043, depending on the indication and excluding any patent term adjustments or extensions.
Platform Technology Applications
 
In addition to the disease-related technology, our intellectual property portfolio also includes applications directed to platform technologies developed internally by us. Exemplary platform technologies include bacterial chassis-related and genetic circuitry-related technological developments, including, for example, improvements in inducible gene regulation, control of bacterial cell growth, including autoregulation thereof, and systems for importing metabolites, as well as systems for prevention production of potentially genotoxic metabolites. These platform technologies, and our intellectual property coverage thereof, are broadly applicable to our therapeutic Synthetic Biotics.
General Considerations
 
Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to account for delays in prosecution at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and/or to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. For regulatory delays, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 

The patent positions of companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of synthetic biology has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the methods used to manufacture those products. For additional risks, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 
Trademarks
 
Our registered trademark portfolio currently contains 35 registered trademarks, 5 allowance and 4 pending applications.
 
Other
 
Generally, we seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. In some circumstances, we may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology, trade secrets and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that company employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Regulatory Matters
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application (NDA) process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the Biologics License Application (BLA), process before such products may be legally marketed in the United States.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and implementing regulations. Our product candidates will be regulated by the FDA as biologics. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
•Completion of required preclinical (or nonclinical) laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and other applicable regulations;
 •Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before shipment of investigational product for human clinical trials may begin;
 
•Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;


•Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials performed in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) to prepare a drug substance and drug product analyzed using validated analytical methods;
 •Development and approval of a companion diagnostic device, if the FDA or the sponsor believes that its use is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding product;
 •Submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval, including payment of application user fees;
 •Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the biologic is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •Potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the BLA; and
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, where appropriate or if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
 
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry and formulation, animal toxicity and pharmacology studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, signed into law on December 29, 2022, (P.L. 117-328) amended the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act to specify that nonclinical testing for drugs and biologics may, but is not required to, include in vivo animal testing. According to the amended language, a sponsor may fulfill nonclinical testing requirements by completing various in vitro assays (e.g., cell-based assays, organ chips, or microphysiological systems), in silico studies (i.e., computer modeling), other human or nonhuman biology-based tests (e.g., bioprinting), or in vivo animal tests. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
 
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. In June 2016, the FDA issued an updated guidance for the industry entitled “Early Clinical Trials with Live Biotherapeutic Products: Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control Information,” which included recommendations from the FDA regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and control information that should be included in an IND for early clinical trials with live biotherapeutic products. This guidance reflects the FDA’s thinking on the topic at the time the guidance was issued and although it is not binding on the FDA or a sponsor, it provided us with additional information about what should be included in INDs for our Synthetic Biotic product candidates. The sponsor will also include in the IND a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if a first phase study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after an IND for an investigational product candidate is submitted to the FDA and human clinical trials have been initiated. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about ongoing or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted.
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators, and in accordance with GCP requirements. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB rules and regulations. Study subjects must sign the IRB-approved informed consent form in order to participate in the clinical trial.
 

In addition, an IRB representing each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct a continuing review and reapprove the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to clinical trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is usually conducted in patients.
 •Phase 2: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 •Phase 3: Larger clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk: benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.
 
In the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, Congress amended the FDCA to require sponsors of a Phase 3 clinical trial, or other “pivotal study” of a new drug to support marketing authorization, to submit a diversity action plan for such clinical trial. The action plan must include the sponsor’s diversity goals for enrollment, as well as a rationale for the goals and a description of how the sponsor will meet them. A sponsor must submit a diversity action plan to FDA by the time the sponsor submits the trial protocol to the agency for review. The FDA may grant a waiver for some or all of the requirements for a diversity action plan. It is unknown at this time how the diversity action plan may affect Phase 3 trial planning and timing or what specific information FDA will expect in such plans, but if FDA objects to a sponsor’s diversity action plan and requires the sponsor to amend the plan or take other actions, it may delay trial initiation.
 
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol, cGMP or IRB requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all.
 
During the development of a new biologic, sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before a BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results with the FDA and to present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the investigational biologic. If this type of discussion occurs, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design of the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete the additional animal studies that may be required for approval and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing acceptable quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be

selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The annual report is customarily submitted in the form of a Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) which is accepted as being equivalent to an IND Annual Report and also meets requirements of the EU (European Union) and International Conference on Harmonization (ICH).
 
There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of most clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available atClinicalTrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to submit the results of their clinical trials after completion, but disclosure of the results can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The NIH’s Final Rule on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and both NIH and FDA recently began enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, stability, quality control and product release procedures, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of a significant user fee (for example, for FY2023 this application fee exceeds $3.2 million); although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances, including where the biologic has been designated as an orphan drug. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee, currently more than $390,000 per program. These fees are typically increased annually, but exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances (such as a waiver for the first human drug application submitted by a qualifying small business and exemptions for orphan products).
 
The FDA reviews all BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and a sponsor’s process to respond to such inquiries. Specifically, the review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with the BLA submission, including component manufacturing, finished product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will request additional testing or information. This may significantly delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCP, the FDA may, for example, determine the data generated by the clinical site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA.
 

The FDA may refer any BLA including applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval.

The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure, potent and effective and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued identity, strength, quality, potency and purity.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the BLA, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies), to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), as amended, an initial BLA or certain supplements to a BLA for a novel product must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirement. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not typically apply to any therapeutic product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), enacted in 2012, made permanent the PREA requirement that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.
 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments). The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of a BLA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for, prior to expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of its currently-owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States, and, if granted, it provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA/BLA sponsor submits clinical pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application for the same drug/biologic. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. To date, we have not received or requested any FDA written requests.
 
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009
 
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, ACA), which included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically-inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.
 
Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an abbreviated application for licensure of a biologic that is biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This abbreviated approval pathway is intended to permit a biosimilar to come to market more quickly and less expensively than if a “full” BLA were submitted, by relying to some extent on the FDA’s previous review and approval of the reference biologic to which the proposed product is similar.
 
Under the abbreviated approval pathway, the biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical trials to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.
 
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed. If pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA as responsive to a Written Request, the 12-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months.


In addition, the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 
The BPCIA is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 
To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has also issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars.
 

Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use will be disclosed publicly by the FDA; the posting will also indicate whether a drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. More than one product candidate may receive an orphan drug designation for the same indication. The benefits of orphan drug designation include research and development tax credits and exemption from FDA prescription drug user fees. Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
Generally, if a product that receives orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the orphan indication, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that for seven years, the FDA is prohibited from approving any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication, except in limited circumstances described further below. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug or biologic for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug or biologic for different conditions. As a result, even if one of our product candidates receive orphan exclusivity, the FDA can still approve different drugs or biologics for use in treating the same indication or disease, which could create a more competitive market for us. Additionally, if a drug or biologic designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity.

Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product with the same drug or biologic for the same condition under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug or biologic for the same condition is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety or a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug or biologic to meet the needs of persons with the disease or condition for which the drug or biologic was designated. Thus, orphan drug exclusivity could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug, as defined by the FDA, and we are not able to show the clinical superiority of our drug or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease.
 
Recent court cases have challenged FDA’s approach to determining the scope of orphan drug exclusivity; however, at this time the agency continues to apply its long-standing interpretation of the governing regulations and has stated that it does not plan to change any orphan drug implementing regulations.
 
In October 2017, the FDA granted SYNB1618 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of PKU and in November 2022, the FDA granted SYNB1353 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of HCU.



Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Rare Pediatric Disease and Priority Review Designations
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 
To be eligible for a Fast Track designation, the FDA must determine, from the request of a sponsor, based on preclinical studies, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast Track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA or BLA for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. In addition, Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
In addition, with the enactment of FDASIA in 2012, Congress created a new regulatory program for product candidates designated by FDA as “breakthrough therapies” upon a request made by the IND sponsors. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval of their respective marketing applications. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 
Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case- by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original BLA or for an NDA for a new molecular entity from the date of filing.
 
The FDA grants Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPDD) for serious and life-threatening diseases that primarily affect individuals from birth to 18 years old and fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. Under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” designation may qualify for a pediatric priority review voucher (pPRV) that can be redeemed to receive a priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program was reauthorized in the Creating Hope Reauthorization Act in December 2020, allowing a product that is designated as a product for a rare pediatric disease prior to October 1, 2024 to be eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher upon approval of a qualifying NDA or BLA prior to October 1, 2026.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 
In April 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the use of SYNB1618 for the treatment of PKU. In August 2022, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for the use of SYNB1353 for the treatment of HCU. We expect to also receive Fast Track designation for SYNB1934, given prior receipt for SYNB1618 and regulatory interactions to date. In January of 2023, Synlogic announced the FDA’s granting of RPDD for SYNB1353 for HCU and for SYNB1934 for PKU.

Accelerated Approval Pathway
 
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug. All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, Congress provided FDA additional statutory authority to mitigate potential risks to patients from continued marketing of ineffective drugs previously granted accelerated approval. Under the act’s amendments to the FDCA, FDA may require the sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to have a confirmatory trial underway prior to approval. The sponsor must also submit progress reports on a confirmatory trial every six months until the trial is complete, and such reports are published on FDA’s website. The amendments also give FDA the option of using expedited procedures to withdraw product approval if the sponsor’s confirmatory trial fails to verify the claimed clinical benefits of the product.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting biologics for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or a BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.



FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and finished product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic prescheduled or unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our CMOs that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions as described below.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur or are discovered after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
•Restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 
•Fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 
•Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 
•Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 
•Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and
 
•Consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal health care programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. Most recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers over a ten‑year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023.
 
From time to time, new legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing the performance of clinical trials outside the United States and commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
European Union drug development, review and approval
 
In the European Union, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 
The new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which took effect on January 31, 2022, aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU clinical trial portal and database”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the appointed reporting member state, whose assessment report is submitted for review by the sponsor and all other competent authorities of all European Union member states in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Concerned Member States). Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the Concerned Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 
As in the United States, similar requirements for posting clinical trial information are described in the European Union (EudraCT) website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
 
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAA, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 
Centralized procedure
 
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency (the EMA) that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
 
National authorization procedures
 
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 

Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 
Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU member state, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
 
Under the above-described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
Conditional approval
 
In specific circumstances, EU legislation (Article 14(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
 
Pediatric studies
 
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.
 
Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
 
European Union regulatory exclusivity
 
In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 

European Union orphan designation and exclusivity
 
The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
The ten-year market exclusivity in the European Union may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
 
•The second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
 
•The applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
 
•The applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
 
PRIME designation
 
The EMA grants access to the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, program to investigational medicines for which it determines there to be preliminary clinical data available showing the potential to address an unmet medical need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated Agency contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products, or CHMP, or Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, are appointed early in PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.
 
A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 
United Kingdom Regulation
 
From January 1, 2021, European Union law no longer directly applies in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has adopted existing European Union medicines regulation as standalone United Kingdom legislation with some amendments to reflect procedural and other requirements with respect to marketing authorizations and other regulatory provisions.
 
In order to market medicines in the United Kingdom, manufacturers must hold a United Kingdom authorization. On January 1, 2021, all European Union marketing authorizations were converted to United Kingdom marketing authorizations subject to a manufacturer opt-out. For a transitional period, Great Britain will adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval

of new marketing authorizations in the community marketing authorization procedure. Such applications must include all information provided to the EMA during the relevant licensing procedure including the final CHMP opinion. The MHRA’s guidance states that the United Kingdom will have the power to take into account marketing authorizations made under the European Union decentralized and mutual recognition procedures. In addition, the MHRA’s guidance has been updated to refer to new national licensing procedures including new routes of evaluation for novel and biotechnological products.
 
United Kingdom medicines legislation is subject to future regulatory change under the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021. This act sets out a new framework for the adoption of medicines regulation.
 
Different rules will apply in Northern Ireland following implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. In Northern Ireland, European Union central marketing applications will continue to apply.
 
The Trade and Cooperation Agreement contains an Annex in relation to medicinal products with the objective of facilitating availability of medicines, promotion of public health and consumer protection in respect of medicinal products between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Annex provides for mutual recognition of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) inspections and certificates, meaning that manufacturing facilities do not need to undergo duplicate inspections for the two markets. The Annex establishes a Working Group on Medicinal Products to deal with matters under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, facilitate co-operation and for the carrying out of technical discussions. It is expected that further bilateral discussions will continue with respect to regulatory areas not the subject of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, including pharmacovigilance. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement also does not include reciprocal arrangements for the recognition of batch testing certification. However, the United Kingdom has listed approved countries, including the EEA which will enable United Kingdom importers and wholesales to recognize certain certification and regulatory standards. The European Commission has not adopted such recognition procedures.
 
It is expected that the establishment of a separate United Kingdom authorization system, albeit with transitional recognition procedures in the United Kingdom, will lead to additional regulatory costs. In addition, additional regulatory costs will be incurred with respect to the lack of mutual recognition of batch testing and related regulatory measures.
 
Rest of the world regulation
 
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs such as Medicare, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. We anticipate third-party payors will provide reimbursement for our products. However, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors often rely on Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates but also have their own methods to individually establish coverage and reimbursement policies. As a result, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement can be a time-consuming and costly process. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Our product candidates may not be considered cost effective. It is time-consuming and expensive for us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
 
Medicare is a federal healthcare program administered by the federal government that covers individuals aged 65 and over as well as individuals with certain disabilities. Drugs may be covered under one or more sections of Medicare depending on the nature of

the drug and the conditions associated with and site of administration. For example, under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level.
 
Medicare Part B covers most injectable drugs given in an in-patient setting and some drugs administered by a licensed medical provider in hospital outpatient departments and doctors’ offices. Medicare Part B is administered by Medicare Administrative Contractors, which generally have the responsibility of making coverage decisions. Subject to certain payment adjustments and limits, Medicare generally pays for a Part B-covered drug based on a percentage of manufacturer-reported average sales price, which is regularly updated. We believe that our product candidates that are intended to be administered intratumorally will be subject to the Medicare Part B rules.
 
We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. For example, the ACA enacted in March 2010, was expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA has been under scrutiny by the U.S. Congress almost since its passage, and certain sections of the ACA have not been fully implemented or effectively repealed. As a result, its longevity continues to be uncertain. In addition, ongoing initiatives in the U.S. have increased and will continue to increase pressure on drug pricing. The announcement or adoption of any such initiative could have an adverse effect on potential revenues from any product candidate that we may successfully develop.
 
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on our profitability placing the medicinal product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union and other countries do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 
The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states) can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 
Other U.S. Health Care Laws and Regulations
 
If our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws include:


•The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the AKS or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA or federal civil money penalties statute;
 
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly 


making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;

•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters; 
 
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 
•The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare or Medicaid to report, on an annual basis, to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners, and teaching hospitals or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, such physicians, non-physician health care practitioners, and teaching hospitals as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
 
•Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
 
In November 2020, HHS finalized significant changes to the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute, as well as the Physician Self-Referral Law (Stark Law) and the civil monetary penalty rules regarding beneficiary inducements, with the goal of offering the healthcare industry more flexibility and reducing the regulatory burden associated with those fraud and abuse laws, particularly with respect to value-based arrangements among industry participants.
 
Finally, the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of their exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that business activities can be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.
 
Ensuring that business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. If business operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other applicable governmental regulations a pharmaceutical manufacturer may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from governmental funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect a pharmaceutical manufacturer’s ability to operate its business and the results of its operations.
 


Health Care Reform in the US and Potential Changes to Health Care Laws
 
The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. For example, Congress must reauthorize the FDA’s user fee programs every five years and often makes changes to those programs in addition to policy or procedural changes that may be negotiated between the FDA and industry stakeholders as part of this periodic reauthorization process. Congress most recently reauthorized the user fee programs in September 2022 but without any substantive policy changes. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
As previously mentioned, the primary trend in the U.S. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
 
Following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA’s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although it is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the United States.
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act that affect health care expenditures. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013 and was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, and will remain in effect through 2032 unless additional Congressional action is taken.

Moreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Notably, on December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2020 into law (P.L. 116-94) that includes a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019 (the CREATES Act). The CREATES Act aims to address the concern articulated by both the FDA and others in the industry that some brand manufacturers have improperly restricted the distribution of their products, including by invoking the existence of a REMS for certain products, to deny generic and biosimilar product developers access to samples of brand products. Because generic and biosimilar product developers need samples to conduct certain comparative testing required by the FDA, some have attributed the inability to timely obtain samples as a cause of delay in the entry of generic and biosimilar products. To remedy this concern, the CREATES Act establishes a private cause of action that permits a generic or biosimilar product developer to sue the brand manufacturer to compel it to furnish the necessary samples on “commercially reasonable, market-based terms.” Whether and how generic and biosimilar product developments will use this new pathway, as well as the likely outcome of any legal challenges to provisions of the CREATES Act, remain highly uncertain and its potential effects on our future commercial products are unknown.
 
More recently, in August 2022, President Biden signed into the law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA. Among other things, the IRA has multiple provisions that may impact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and throughout the United States. Starting in 2023, a manufacturer of a drug or biological product covered by Medicare Parts B or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if the drug product’s price increases faster than the rate of inflation. This calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal government is directly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D. Additionally, starting in payment year 2026, CMS will negotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single source Part D drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. CMS will also negotiate drug prices for a select number of Part B drugs starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for

negotiation, it is expected that the revenue generated from such drug will decrease. In addition to the IRA’s drug price negotiation provisions, President Biden’s Executive Order 14087, issued in October 2022, called for the CMS innovation center to prepare and submit a report to the White House on potential payment and delivery modes that would complement to IRA, lower drug costs, and promote access to innovative drugs. As of February 3, 2023 the report had not been released but it is expected to further inform the current Administration’s priorities and activities in this area.
 
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and other members of the healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that appears to be leading to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area. The Federal Trade Commission in mid-2022 also launched sweeping investigations into the practices of the PBM industry that could lead to additional federal and state legislative or regulatory proposals targeting such entities’ operations, pharmacy networks, or financial arrangements. Significant efforts to change the PBM industry as it currently exists in the United States may affect the entire pharmaceutical supply chain and the business of other stakeholders, including biopharmaceutical developers like us. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.

We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved drug, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
 
Other Regulatory Matters
 
We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. These operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations may also produce hazardous waste products. We contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. Our products are defined as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) or Genetically Modified Micro-organisms (GMM) and, dependent on their classification and containment, may be subject to regulation.
 
The United States does not have any federal legislation that is specific to genetically modified organisms. GMOs are regulated pursuant to health, safety, and environmental legislation governing conventional products. The U.S. approach to regulating GMOs is premised on the assumption that regulation should focus on the nature of the products, rather than the process in which they were produced.
 
The clinical development and marketing of GMM within the European Union, and elsewhere, falls under different regulations and practices in each country, which may involve approval by environmental or other regulatory bodies, as well as health authorities, and may establish the requirement for a risk assessment for the testing or authorization of the product.
 
Manufacturing
 
We have made and continue to make significant investments in our manufacturing organization, including process development and cGMP production infrastructure to establish manufacturing processes designed to support production of clinical trial material. The manufacturing processes are designed to enable us to reproducibly manufacture high quality living medicines at clinical scale and, later, at commercial scale to enable approval of our product candidates. We have built a fully integrated development and manufacturing organization with an internal process development group, quality group and manufacturing capabilities with the lease of cGMP cleanroom space in Waltham, Massachusetts. This facility enables us to produce clinical trial material for early to mid-stage studies of our clinical pipeline. We continue to build the organization to support scale-up and development towards commercialization. We currently expect to continue to work with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) for production of late-stage clinical trial material.



Clinical trial material for our Phase 1 study of SYNB1618 for PKU were manufactured by a CMO. These first clinical trials used a frozen liquid and solid formulation as the drug presentation. Since then, we have made additional investment in our formulation development that optimizes our production of solid dose formulations for our clinical programs. The powder for oral suspension formulation capability allows us to produce a more user-friendly presentation for later stage clinical development and future commercial use. We are continuing to invest and investigate the utility of additional presentations for solid formulations of our Synthetic Biotics including capsules.
 
To enable the production of high levels of cells, or biomass, we can engineer our Synthetic Biotics with switches. These switches are comprised of transcription factor and promoter pairs that allow for controlled expression of the therapeutic effectors produced by our Synthetic Biotics. To ensure the metabolic capacity of the cells is allotted to the production of a high level of biomass during manufacturing, the effector circuits in the Synthetic Biotic programs are not expressed during this growth phase. At the end of the manufacturing process, the circuits are then induced, or activated. This two-step approach was designed to enable a high level of biomass production as well as to deliver the required activity necessary at the time of administration. We continue to devote resources to process development and the generation of improved products.
 
As we progress in clinical development, we will need to increase our production scale to support late stage clinical trials and commercial manufacturing. We are in the process of assessing CMOs who meet our criteria to supply our late-stage clinical development and commercial supply. We will compare the merits of working with one or more CMOs who meet our criteria with the possibility of building cGMP manufacturing capacity and capabilities internally.
 
Competition
 
The biotechnology industry is extremely competitive in the race to develop new products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our industry-leading expertise in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering of non-pathogenic bacteria, our clinical development expertise, and strong intellectual property position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from companies that use synthetic biology or cell therapy development platforms and from companies focused on more conventional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and antibodies. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including larger pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and academia. Many of these competitors may have access to greater capital and resources than us. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in accessing technologies to enable our programs. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, but we will also have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Competitors include other synthetic biology companies developing other synthetic biology methods, cellular and microbiome-based companies, DNA and RNA-based companies, as well as companies developing small molecules or other biologics. In the case of indications that we are targeting with our own Synthetic Biotics, competitors include, but are not limited to:
 
PKU
 
•BioMarin, Inc. has two approved products and a development-stage investigational therapy;
 
•PTC Therapeutics, Inc., Nestle Health Sciences S.A. (Codexis, Inc.), Homology Medicines, Inc. and Jnana Therapeutics have products in clinical trials; and
 
•Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Generation Bio Co., American Gene Technologies International Inc., SOM Biotech SL, and others are developing product candidates.
 HCU
 
•Travere Therapeutics, Inc. and Aeglea BioTherapeutics have products in clinical trials.
 
Enteric hyperoxaluria
 
•Novome Biotechnologies, Inc. and Oxidien Pharmaceuticals, LLC have drug candidates in clinical trials; and
 
•Federation Bio, Inc. and others are developing product candidates.
 
Gout



•Selecta Biosciences, Jiangsu HengRui Medicine Co., Ltd., Horizon Pharma Inc., Dyve Biosciences, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, and HemoShear Therapeutics and others are developing product candidates.
 
Our Team: Executives, Founders and Scientific Advisors

Our scientific founders, Timothy Lu, M.D., Ph.D., and James Collins, Ph.D., are experts in the emerging field of synthetic biology. In addition to our management team and founders, we have established advisory relationships with researchers and clinicians dedicated to the development of Synthetic Biotic therapeutic products for patients with significant unmet medical needs and whose expertise spans synthetic biology, metabolic engineering, metabolism, and immuno-modulation arenas. Our scientific advisors include Dr. Lu and Dr. Collins; Paul Miller, Ph.D., Christopher Voigt, Ph.D., Cammie Lesser, M.D., Ph.D. and Kristala Prather, Ph.D., experts in synthetic biology and bacterial metabolism. We expect to expand our advisory boards as we grow. All of our founders and advisors are equity holders in us and receive compensation as scientific advisors. Although they are regularly available for scientific consultation, our arrangements with these individuals do not entitle us to any of their existing or future intellectual property derived from their independent research or research with other third parties.
Human Capital
 
As of March 22, 2023, we had 72 full-time employees. Of our full-time employees, 58 were primarily engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Talent Acquisition and Retention
 
We recognize that our employees are essential to our success. To this end, we support business growth by seeking to attract and retain best-in-class talent. We use internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled candidates for open positions. We believe that we are able to attract and retain the talent that is required to meet our business goals.
Total Rewards
 
Our total rewards philosophy has been to invest in our workforce by offering a competitive compensation and benefits package. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, annual incentive bonuses and long-term equity incentive awards. We also offer comprehensive employee benefits, such as life, disability and health insurance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, a 401(k) plan with market-competitive company matching contributions, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. It is our express intent to be an employer of choice in our industry by providing a market-competitive compensation and benefits package.
Health, Safety and Wellness
 
We have always invested, and will continue to invest, in the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being.
 
Our investments and the prioritization of employee health, safety, and wellness have taken on particular significance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. To protect and support our team members, we have implemented health and safety measures that include maximizing personal workspaces, altering work schedules, mandating vaccines, and providing asymptomatic COVID-19 testing if requested. We continue to monitor this evolving situation and will continue to seek programs to educate and assist employees whenever possible.
 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
 
We believe a diverse workforce is critical to our success. Our mission is to value differences in races, ethnicities, religions, nationalities, genders, ages and sexual orientations, as well as education, skill sets and experience. We are focused on inclusive hiring practices, fair and equitable treatment, organizational flexibility and training and resources.
Training and Development
 
We believe in encouraging employees to be lifelong learners by providing ongoing learning and leadership training opportunities. While we strive to provide real-time recognition of employee performance, we have a formal annual review process not only to determine pay and equity adjustments tied to individual contributions, but to identify areas where employees may benefit from additional training and development opportunities.

Corporate Information and History
 
We were originally incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 2007 under the name “Mirna Therapeutics, Inc.” We carry on our business directly and through our subsidiaries.
 
Our subsidiary, Synlogic Operating Company, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware as TMC Therapeutics, Inc. on March 14, 2014. On July 15, 2014, TMC Therapeutics, Inc. changed its name to Synlogic, Inc. (Private Synlogic when referred to prior to the Merger (as defined below)). On July 2, 2015, the common and preferred shareholders of Private Synlogic executed the Synlogic, LLC Contribution Agreement, pursuant to which such common and preferred shareholders contributed such shareholders’ equity interests in Private Synlogic in exchange for common and preferred units in a newly formed parent company named Synlogic, LLC (the 2015 Reorganization). In addition, IBDCo was formed as a subsidiary of Synlogic, LLC, as part of the 2015 Reorganization, and we entered into a license, option and merger agreement with AbbVie for the development of treatments for IBD. On December 22, 2021, IBDCo was merged with and into Synlogic Operating Company, Inc. and IBDCo ceased to exist as a separate entity.
 
In May 2017, Private Synlogic completed a reorganization (2017 Reorganization) pursuant to which Synlogic, LLC merged with and into Private Synlogic, with Private Synlogic continuing as the surviving corporation. Pursuant to the 2017 Reorganization, the common units and preferred units of Synlogic, LLC, together consisting of Class A preferred units, contingently redeemable Class A preferred units and Class B preferred units, were exchanged for common stock and preferred stock of Private Synlogic, respectively. Additionally, Private Synlogic issued equity awards under the Synlogic 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (2017 Plan) to replace the canceled incentive units pursuant to the termination of the Synlogic, LLC 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (2015 LLC Plan).
 
On August 28, 2017, Synlogic, Inc., formerly known as Mirna Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: MIRN) (Mirna), completed its business combination with Private Synlogic pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 15, 2017, by and among Mirna, Meerkat Merger Sub, Inc. (Merger Sub), and Private Synlogic (the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Private Synlogic, with Private Synlogic surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Mirna (the “Merger”). On August 25, 2017, in connection with, and prior to the completion of the Merger, Mirna effected a reverse stock split of its common stock (the Reverse Stock Split), and on August 28, 2017, immediately after completion of the Merger, Mirna changed its name to “Synlogic, Inc.” (NASDAQ: SYBX).
 

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Mirna issued shares of its common stock to Private Synlogic’s stockholders, using an exchange ratio, after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split, for each share of Private Synlogic common stock and preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger (Exchange Ratio). In addition, Mirna assumed all of the stock options outstanding under the Synlogic 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (2017 Plan), with such stock options henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of Mirna’s common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the number of shares of Private Synlogic common stock previously represented by such options. Mirna also assumed the 2017 Plan.
