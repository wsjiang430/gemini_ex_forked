Overview
Salarius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing effective treatments for cancers with high, unmet medical need. Specifically, we are developing treatments for cancers caused by dysregulated gene expression, i.e., genes which are incorrectly turned on or off. We are developing two classes of drugs that address gene dysregulation: protein inhibitors and targeted protein degraders. Our technologies have the potential to work in both liquid and solid tumors. Our current pipeline consists of two primary compounds: 1) SP-3164, a small molecule protein degrader, and 2) seclidemstat (SP-2577), a small molecule inhibitor. Secondary compounds are in early stages of development.
Recent Events
Partial Clinical Hold 
On October 18, 2022, the Company voluntarily paused new patient enrollment in its Phase 1/2 trial of seclidemstat as a treatment for Ewing sarcoma and FET-rearranged sarcomas per protocol design. The pause in new patient enrollment was due to a metastatic FET-rearranged sarcoma patient death that was classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR). Upon review of the SUSAR and available information by the Company’s independent Safety Review Committee for the clinical trial, patients currently receiving seclidemstat treatment may continue treatment after consulting with their physician. During a conference call with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 1, 2022, the FDA informed the Company that the agency agreed with the voluntary enrollment pause and, as an administrative action, the FDA provided verbal notification that the Ewing sarcoma and FET-rearranged sarcoma trial was on partial clinical hold. While on partial clinical hold, the FDA informed the Company that the pause in patient enrollment shall remain in place and patients currently receiving seclidemstat treatment may continue treatment after consulting with their physician. FDA’s clinical hold procedures provide the Company with an administrative process to work with the FDA to analyze the available data, adjust clinical protocols, and make other changes that may be needed in order to restart patient enrollment.
Payments from Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas
On February 15, 2023, the Company received $1.5 million from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. The payment is part of a non-dilutive grant of approximately $16.1 million awarded to support operations and development of the Company's drug candidate seclidemstat for the treatment of Ewing sarcoma. The $1.5 million payment brings the Company's cumulative disbursement from CPRIT to approximately $16.0 million. As of March 24, 2023, grant receivable from CPRIT is approximately $0.1million. 
At the Market Offering
From January 27, 2023 through March 24, 2023, the Company sold 142,499 shares of its common shares with gross proceeds of approximately $0.4 million. 
SP-3204 - Targeted Protein Degrader
On January 5, 2023 we announced the issuance of U.S. Patent No. 11,535,603, which covers our novel cereblon-binding protein degrader, SP-3204. SP-3204 is a GSPT1 protein degrader and has potential in hematological cancers. 
Focused Programs
SP-3164 - A novel targeted protein degrader
The field of Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD) is rapidly growing and attracting a lot of interest from the biggest pharmaceutical companies. The two most common types of protein degraders are molecular glues (MGs) and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). SP-3164 is a next-generation cereblon-binding MG. The first generation MGs, lenalidomide (Revlimid®) and pomalidomide (Pomylast®), have had great success in treating hematological malignancies. 
MGs are small molecules that commandeer the body’s normal protein degradation processes by causing proteins to stick to one another thereby inducing selective degradation of cancer-causing proteins. Derived from avadomide, SP-3164 is engineered using DECS (deuterium-enabled chiral switching), a process that replaces hydrogen atoms with deuterium to stabilize the molecule’s active enantiomer, resulting in a novel molecular entity with the potential for increased efficacy and improved safety compared to the 1st generation compound. SP-3164 degrades transcription factors IKZF1 (Ikaros) and IKZF3 (Aiolos), along with other proteins, resulting in both direct anti-cancer activity and immune-modulating properties. SP-3164 has potential in both hematologic and solid tumors and is currently in IND-enabling studies. In preclincial studies, SP-3164 demonstrated more efficient and robust degradation of Ikaros/Aiolos compared to lenalidomide and pomalidomide. Additionally, in animal models of lymphoma and multiple myeloma, treatment with SP-3164 resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition compared to control animals. When SP-3164 was combined with standard of care agents, the result was even more pronounced and in some cases resulted in complete regression of the tumors. 
SP-2577 
SP-2577 is a small-molecule LSD1 inhibitor with a novel scaffold. The molecule was discovered using structure-based computational screening coupled with chemical screening and further optimization with structure-activity relationship studies.
We believe that SP-2577 is different from the four other LSD1 inhibitors that have active clinical development programs because in addition to inhibiting LSD1’s enzymatic activity, we also believe it more comprehensively inhibits LSD1’s scaffolding properties. To our knowledge, SP-2577 is one of two reversible LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development. The three other LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development are irreversible inhibitors. SP-2577 has differentiated properties that may allow it to be developed in a broader range of cancer indications and in different combination regimens compared to the other LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development. Pharmacokinetic data indicates that SP-2577 can be given at dose levels that achieve drug exposure levels in patients above where activity was demonstrated in preclinical studies. We believe that SP-2577’s profile will allow for more flexible dosing strategies by potentially having a wide therapeutic window. This is being studied and developed in our ongoing clinical program.
LSD1 Background
LSD1 is an enzyme that is, in part, responsible for epigenetic regulation of genes that support cancer growth. According to B. Majello, et al. in “Expanding the Role of the Histone Lysine-Specific Demethylase LSD1 in Cancer”, LSD1 dysregulation is a key driver in multiple malignancies. LSD1 induces a cancer phenotype through its enzymatic activity and through its role as a scaffolding protein in epigenetic complexes. LSD1 is over-expressed in various cancers, and higher levels of LSD1 are often associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancer, making LSD1 inhibition an area of interest in cancer research.
Program Development
Our goal is to develop SP-3164 and SP-2577 for treatment of cancers while attempting to maximize return for investors. To achieve this goal, our strategy consists of a two-pronged approach: 1) speed-to-market by developing SP-3164 and SP-2577 in high unmet need indications and 2) expand the market by developing SP-3164 and SP-2577 in larger market indications. 
SP-3164 Development
Our plan is to develop SP-3164 in high unmet need hematological indications and solid tumors. Our goal is to file an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for SP-3164 in the first half of 2023, and begin a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the second half of 2023. SP-3164's development in hematological indications leverages clinical safety and efficacy data demonstrated by avadomide in hematological malignancies (e.g., Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma, Follicular Lymphoma) across several clinical trials. SP-3164 is the stabilized, active S-enantiomer of avadomide, which exists as a 1:1 ratio of the S and R enantiomers. However, only the S-enantiomer is the active, anti-cancer species. Therefore, because SP-3164 is the stabilized S-
enantiomer, it has the potential to show improved therapy and safety over avadomide. SP-3164's potential has been demonstrated in in vitro studies and in preclinical mouse models of lymphoma and multiple myeloma. SP-3164 treatment showed robust anticancer activity in cells and tumored mouse models. Encouragingly, in lymphoma preclinical mouse models, treatment with SP-3164 combined with a standard of care agent resulted in complete tumor regressions. 
Development of SP-2577 in Ewing Sarcoma Patients
Ewing sarcoma is a rare pediatric cancer with a lack of treatment options. FDA has put in place several different types of incentives for companies pursuing therapeutic treatments for such conditions. We have benefited from several of these incentives, including SP-2577’s orphan designation and status designation as a potential treatment for a “rare pediatric disease.” This means that if proven efficacious with a benefit-risk profile that the FDA judges to be positive and supportive of approval, SP-2577 could qualify for priority review and to receive a priority review voucher ("PRV"), although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. If received, we would have the ability to sell the PRV to other qualifying pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, in December 2019 we announced that SP-2577 had been granted Fast Track Designation by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma patients. Fast Track is a process designed by the FDA to expedite the development and review of new drugs with the potential to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill unmet medical needs. The aim is to streamline the drug development and review process by allowing for more frequent communications with the agency to assure that questions and issues are resolved quickly, which often leads to earlier drug approval and access by patients. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2018 and in the first quarter of 2021 we announced that the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) had been established and the dose expansion phase of the trial would begin. We also announced that we will be combining SP-2577 with a commonly administered 2nd and 3rd line regimen, topotecan and cyclophosphamide in Ewing sarcoma. We hope that this modification will allow us to treat patients earlier in the continuum of care, increase the potential addressable patient population, and facilitate patient access to SP-2577. Additional clinical trials of SP-2577 will be necessary to receive FDA approval.
Disease background: Ewing sarcoma is a devastating pediatric and young adult cancer for which there are no approved targeted therapies. The cause of Ewing sarcoma is a chromosomal translocation involving the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (“EWSR1”) gene and ETS family genes, resulting in expression of a fusion oncoprotein. The resulting oncoprotein has been found to co-localize with LSD1 throughout the genome, making LSD1 an attractive therapeutic target for Ewing sarcoma. Based on data from the National Institute of Health (“NIH”) and physician collaborators, we believe there are approximately 500 Ewing sarcoma patients diagnosed annually in the United States. Current treatment for Ewing sarcoma consists of an intensive chemotherapy regime, radiation and often disfiguring surgeries. Due to the harshness of current treatment options, children and adolescents often experience long-term side effects such as slowed growth and development, learning problems and an increased risk of developing second cancers. According to published literature, including “Management of recurrent Ewing sarcoma: challenges and approaches” by David Van Mater and Lars Wagner, patients with overt metastasis (20-30% of patients) or recurrent disease (~20%) have poor prognosis, with less than a 30% chance of experiencing disease-free survival, and there is currently not a standardized treatment available for recurrent Ewing sarcoma. These are the patients that we aim to help.
Expand SP-2577 Market by Pursuing Large Market Indications
As LSD1 can interact with over 60 regulatory proteins other than FET-fusion oncoproteins, we believe that LSD1 may also play a critical role in progression of various other cancer types. 
In addition to solid tumors, SP-2577 has shown promising preclinical activity in hematologic cancers. In 2021 we announced the initiation of an MD Anderson Cancer Center sponsored Investigator Initiated Trial studying SP-2577 in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Myelodysplastic syndromes can progress into Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and data from our ongoing trial could inform development of SP-2577 in hematologic cancers (also referred to as “liquid tumors" or "blood cancer”), including AML. The American Cancer Society estimates there were almost 20,000 new cases of AML in the US alone in 2020.
Recent data from “LSD1 Ablation Stimulates Anti-tumor Immunity and Enables Checkpoint Blockade” by W. Sheng, et al. and “Inhibition of Histone Lysine-specific Demethylase 1 Elicits Breast Tumor Immunity and Enhances Antitumor Efficacy of Immune Checkpoint Blockade” by Y. Qin, et al. suggests that LSD1 plays a role in tumor immune activity and can sensitize tumors to checkpoint inhibitors. These works have sparked interest in combining LSD1 inhibitors with checkpoint inhibitors. 
The following figure lists our programs and their respective stages of development: 
Clinical Trials
Ewing Sarcoma
We are conducting a multi-site, open-label Phase 1/2 trial of SP-2577 for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory Ewing sarcoma. Patients must have histologic confirmation of Ewing sarcoma that is refractory or recurrent and must have received one prior course of therapy for the disease. Among other inclusion criteria, patients must be 12 years or older and have a life expectancy of greater than 4 months. 
The primary objectives of this clinical trial are to study the safety and tolerability of SP-2577. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetic assessment, food effects on drug pharmacokinetics, determination of the maximum tolerated dose (“MTD”) and assessment of preliminary signs of anti-tumor activity. Additionally, the trial will explore the use of circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”), cell-free DNA (“cfDNA”), Hemoglobin F and changes in molecular signatures of the tumor as pharmacodynamic markers of disease burden, drug effect and tumor response.
In February 2021, we announced that we reached the recommended phase 2 dose and would initiate the dose expansion portion of the trial. Ewing sarcoma patients will be treated in combination with topotecan/cyclophosphamide. 
We have sixteen sites across the United States in our Phase 1/2 trial of SP-2577 for treatment of Ewing sarcoma.
In October 2022, the Company voluntarily paused new patient enrollment in its Phase 1/2 trial of seclidemstat as a treatment for Ewing sarcoma and FET-rearranged sarcomas per protocol design. The pause in new patient enrollment was due to a metastatic FET-rearranged sarcoma patient death, not an Ewing sarcoma patient death, that was classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR). Upon review of the SUSAR and available information by the Company’s independent Safety Review Committee for the clinical trial, patients currently receiving seclidemstat treatment may continue treatment after consulting with their physician. During a conference call with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on November 1, 2022, the FDA informed the Company that the agency agreed with the voluntary enrollment pause and, as an administrative action, the FDA provided verbal notification that the Ewing sarcoma and FET-rearranged sarcoma trial was on partial clinical hold. While on partial clinical hold, FDA informed the Company that the pause in patient enrollment shall remain in place and patients currently receiving seclidemstat treatment may continue treatment after consulting with their physician. FDA’s clinical hold procedures provide the Company with an administrative process to work with the FDA to analyze the available data, adjust clinical protocols, and make other changes that may be needed in order to restart patient enrollment.
Hematological Cancers
In June 2021 we announced the initiation of an Investigator Initiated Trial studying SP-2577 in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). The Phase 1/2 trial is being led by Dr. Guillermo Montalban-Bravo from the Department of Leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. The dose-escalation stage of the Phase 1/2 trial will enroll patients aged 18 and older with MDS or CMML. Patients will receive 75 mg/m2 of azacitidine, administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC), on days one through seven of each 28-day cycle in combination with an escalating, twice-daily dose of seclidemstat administered as an oral tablet. Once the MTD of the combination is determined by the Safety Review Committee, the dose-expansion stage is planned that will include additional patients to confirm the safety and tolerability profile for seclidemstat in combination with azacitidine and capture efficacy data regarding overall response rate, duration of response, leukemia-free survival, relapse-free survival, and overall survival.
In October, 2022, in response to the Company voluntarily pausing the Phase 1/2 trial of seclidemstat as a treatment in Ewing sarcoma and FET-rearranged sarcomas, MD Anderson also voluntarily paused new patient enrollment. The FDA informed MD Anderson that the agency agreed with the voluntary enrollment pause and, as an administrative action, the FDA provided notification that the MDS and CMML trial was on partial clinical hold. While on partial clinical hold, FDA informed MD Anderson that the pause in patient enrollment shall remain in place and patients currently receiving seclidemstat treatment may continue treatment after consulting with their physician. FDA’s clinical hold procedures provide the Company with an administrative process to work with the FDA to analyze the available data, adjust clinical protocols, and make other changes that may be needed in order to restart patient enrollment.
Strategic Agreements
Listed below are the strategic agreements that may have an impact on our results of operations:
The University of Utah Research Foundation
On August 3, 2011, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with the University of Utah Research Foundation (the “University of Utah”), for the exclusive license with respect to patent rights protecting SP-2577 and related compounds. The patent rights were for a provisional patent. The term of agreement is until the last-to-expire of the patent rights licensed under the agreement, which is expected to be as late as 2037, unless otherwise terminated by law or by the parties pursuant to the agreement.
In further consideration of the rights granted by the University of Utah, we agreed to pay all past patent expenses incurred in filing and prosecuting the patent application, and pay all future patent expenses incurred including filing, prosecuting, enforcing and maintaining the patent right.
Under the terms of the agreement, we may be obligated to make certain future milestone and royalty payments, including: (i) an earned royalty payment based on a single digit percentage of net sales and a required minimum annual royalty payment commencing with the third full calendar year after the first commercial sale in the U.S., Germany, France, Japan or the U.K. ranging from $10,000 to $40,000 per year which minimum payments are fully creditable towards the earned royalty payment with respect to the relevant calendar year, (ii) a sublicensee fee based on a single digit percentage of revenues received by sublicensees, (iii) milestone payments in agreed dollar amounts upon receiving regulatory approvals allowing the marketing and sale of licensed products or licensed methods relating to the patients’ rights in each of the U.S., the European Union and Japan not exceeding $150,000 in the aggregate and (iv) a milestone payment in an agreed dollar amount upon the two year anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product not exceeding $1.0 million.
Either party has a right to terminate the agreement for a breach of or default under the agreement following a 60-day cure period. If we ceases to carry on our business with respect to the patent right granted under the agreement, the University of Utah has a right to terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ notice. In addition, we may terminate the agreement at any time upon ninety days’ notice to the University of Utah.
Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas
In June 2016, we entered into a Cancer Research Grant Contract with Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (“CPRIT”). The grant contract was for an amount up to $18.7 million to fund the development of LSD-1 inhibitor. The grant was subsequently amended to remove $2.6 million related to a discontinued prostate cancer 
program. This is a 3-year grant award which originally expired on May 31, 2019. The grant now expires on May 31, 2023. The Company has applied for extension until November 30, 2023. As of March 24, 2023 grant receivable balance from CPRIT is approximately $0.1 million.
Upon commercialization of SP-2577, and if our revenue is above a specified dollar threshold, we will be required to pay up to 3%-5% of such revenue during the revenue term until CPRIT receives an amount equal to a single digit multiple of the total grant award. The revenue term is determined on a country by country basis as revenue during the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of a product or service until there no longer exists any exclusivity for a commercial product or service in such country, which may be as late as 2037. In the event CPRIT receives such specified percentage of the total grant award from us during the revenue term, we will continue to pay CPRIT a reduced revenue sharing percentage during the remainder of the revenue term. Additionally, if we are required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of one or more third parties in order to sell commercial products in any given country, then the revenue sharing percentages may be reduced.
The agreement may be terminated by the mutual consent of the parties or by us at our discretion. CPRIT may also terminate the agreement upon an event of default, which includes our failure to conduct the project within the scope agreed by the parties, our material breach of the agreement, our failure to comply with applicable law, or bankruptcy or discontinuation of our business operations, among others. In addition, the agreement may be terminated by CPRIT if the allocated funds become legally unavailable during the term and CPRIT is unable to obtain additional funds for such purposes. If CPRIT terminates the agreement prior to the expiration due to an event of default or if we terminate the agreement, CPRIT may require us to repay some or all of the disbursed grant.
DeuteRx, LLC
On January 12, 2022, we entered into the ASCA with DeuteRx, LLC, pursuant to which we acquired targeted protein development portfolio. 
The portfolio was purchased for an aggregate purchase price of $1,500,000 and the delivery of 40,000 shares of our common stock. We also agreed to pay to Seller (i) milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events and (ii) royalty payments. All cost related to the transaction were immediately expensed in 2022 as acquired in-process research and development expenses since SP-3164 has not yet achieved regulatory approval and, absent obtaining such approval, has no alternative future use. A member of the Company’s Board of Directors also serves as a consultant to the Seller and is employed by an affiliate of the Seller. 
Simultaneously with our entry into the ASCA, we and DeuteRx entered into the R&D Services Agreement, which sets forth the terms and conditions upon which DeuteRx will provide services to us, including the implementation and performance of a Non-Clinical and Clinical Development Scope of Work.
Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing 
The Company currently has no manufacturing facilities, nor does it have a sales and marketing organization because our product candidates are still in preclinical or early-stage clinical development.
Intellectual Property 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a SP-2577 worldwide portfolio of 71 patents and patent applications of which 64 were issued or allowed and 7 are pending applications. This portfolio includes (i) composition of matter and methods of use patents on our lead candidate, SP-2577. Transaction have claims that cover the composition of matter of SP-3164 with a patent term expiration of January 14, 2034. The patents and patent applications related to SP-2577 are owned by the University of Utah Research Foundation and are exclusively licensed to us.
In the United States, our anticipated first target market, we have two composition of matter patents (US#8,987,335 and US#9,266,838) and two methods of use patents (US#9,642,857, US#9,555,024) protecting SP-2577 and related compounds which will expire in 2032.
As of December 31, 2022 the targeted degradation patent portfolio consisted of 5 patent families with 13 granted patents and 4 pending applications acquired in the DeuteRx Transaction.
In addition to patent protection, we seek to rely on trade secret protection, trademark protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our chemistry, technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators and other contractors and by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them. Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when we deem appropriate.
Competition
SP-3164: Targeted Protein Degradation and Competitive Differentiation
The field of Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD) is rapidly growing and attracting a lot of interest from the biggest pharmaceutical companies. The two most common types of protein degraders are molecular glues (MGs) and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs). SP-3164 is a next-generation CRBN-binding MG. There are several MGs in clinical development (see table below for select MGs in development) and additional compounds in IND-enabling studies. 

Compound Name | Company | Main Protein Targets | Indications(Phase of development)
Iberdomide (CC-220) | Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) | Ikaros/Aiolos (I/A) | MM (Phase 3), NHL (Phase 1/2) 
Mezigdomide (CC-92480) | BMS | I/A | R/R MM and ND MM (Phase 3) 
CC-99282 | BMS | I/A | NHL (Phase 1b), CLL (Phase 1b) 
CFT7455 | C4 Therapeutics | I/A | NHL and MM (Phase 1) 
BTX-1188 | BioTheryX | GSPT1, I/A | AST, NHL and AML (Phase 1) 

To the best of our knowledge, SP-3164 will be the first, deuterium- stabilized cereblon-binding drug to enter the clinic. Based on preclinical studies, SP-3164 may have advantageous pharmacokinetic properties that could increase tolerability. Compared to MGs currently on the market including Revlimid® and Pomalyst®, SP-3164 showed more robust degradation of Ikaros and Aiolos and resulted in improved tumor growth inhibition in mouse models. In addition, although SP-3164 is currently in IND-enabling studies, there is extensive clinical data generated by the first-generation compound, avadomide, that SP-3164 can build upon. This includes development of a precision medicine approach to select for patients who may be more sensitive to SP-3164. 
SP-2577: LSD1 Inhibition and Competitive Differentiation
LSD1 is a widely published epigenetic target and has attracted interest from several large pharmaceutical companies. LSD1 helps drive cancer progression through demethylation of histones and by acting as a scaffolding protein within various activator and repressor complexes. According to clinicaltrials.gov, there are four targeted LSD1 inhibitors and one dual LSD1/HDAC6 inhibitor (JBI-295) in Phase 1/2 clinical development for a variety of cancer types (shown in the table below). 
Company | Binding Mechanism | Drug Name | Latest Phase
Salarius | Reversible | SP-2577 | Phase 1/2 
Oryzon | Irreversible | ORY-1001 | Phase 2 
Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb | Reversible | CC-90011 | Phase 2 
Imago | Irreversible | IMG-7289 | Phase 2 
Jubilant | Irreversible | JBI-295 | Phase 1 

We believe that SP-2577 is differentiated in its ability to effectively inhibit LSD1’s scaffolding properties in addition to LSD1’s demethylation activity. Compared to irreversible LSD1 inhibitors, our molecule has a novel binding mechanism (reversible as opposed to irreversible) and binding location (closer to substrate binding site as opposed to the FAD cofactor of LSD1). This was demonstrated in a study conducted by A. Sehrawat, et al. in “LSD1 activates 
a Lethal Prostate Cancer Gene Network Independently of its Demethylase Function” with SP-2509, an analogue of SP-2577. Compared to LSD1 inhibitors in clinical development, SP-2577 binds to LSD1 in a different manner, which we hypothesizes may grant it therapeutic advantages over the competition. To further justify this hypothesis, we compared the affect of SP-2577, GSK-LSD1 (analogue to GSK's former clinical candidate), CC-90011 (Celgene's reversible, enzymatic inhibiting clinical candidate), and ORY-1001 (Oryzon's irreversible, enzymatic-inhibiting clinical candidate) on cell viability in vitro. SP-2577 was able to better inhibit cell growth across 32 cancer cell types compared to GSK-LSD1, 20 cell types compared to CC-90011, and 40 cell lines compared to ORY-1001. 
Government Regulation and Product Approvals
United States Government Regulation 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA’s implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. We cannot market a drug product candidate in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval. 
Drug Development Process 
The process required before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally include the following:
•completion of extensive non-clinical laboratory tests and animal studies in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") regulations, applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals, such as the Animal Welfare Act or other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug ("IND") for human clinical testing, which must be deemed effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB") overseeing each clinical site before each trial may be initiated at that site;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCP") requirements , and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information,to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication;
•submission to the FDA of a New Drug Approval (“NDA”) for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness from results of clinical trials, as well as the results of preclinical testing, detailed information about the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and proposed labeling and packaging for the product candidate;
•consideration by an FDA Advisory Committee, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of potential FDA audits of the preclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the nonclinical, clinical and/or manufacturing sites or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, (“API”), and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”); and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States, including agreement on post-marketing commitments, if applicable.
Before testing any drugs with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug enters the preclinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP and the Animal Welfare Act.
Before commencing the first clinical trial in humans, an IND must be submitted to the FDA, and the IND must become effective. An IND sponsor must submit the results of pre-clinical testing to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term pre-clinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin if all other requirements, including IRB review and approval, have been met. If the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trial, such as whether human research subjects will be exposed to an unreasonable health risk, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed.  Even after the IND has gone into effect and clinical testing has begun, the FDA may also impose clinical holds on clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with state and federal regulations, including GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial,  dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events (“AEs”) should occur. Each protocol and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an IRB, for approval of each site at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess pharmacological actions, safety and side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a  larger but limited patient population to study metabolism of the drug, pharmacokinetics, the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal trials, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. 
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA has express statutory authority to require post-market clinical studies to address safety issues.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing and other sources that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the 
sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
In limited circumstances, the FDA also permits the administration of investigational drug products to patients under its expanded access regulatory authorities. Under the FDA’s expanded access authority, patients who are not able to participate in a clinical trial may be eligible for accessing investigational products, including through individual compassionate or emergency use in concert with their requesting physician. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies, develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
FDA Review and Approval Process
After completion of the required clinical testing, a sponsor may prepare and submit an NDA to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all non-clinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s toxicology, pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA generally must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers depending on the designated pathway for submission. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) performance goals that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA, because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. That deadline can be extended under certain circumstances, including by the FDA’s requests for additional information. The targeted action date can also be shortened to 6 months of the “filing” date for products that are granted priority review designation because they are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may issue a refuse-to-file letter and request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility(ies) in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee-typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts-for consideration, discussion and a vote on specific questions relevant to the approval decision. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP requirements is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
During the NDA review process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. A REMS could 
include a medication guide, communication plan or elements to assure safe use, such as required healthcare provider or pharmacy certification, a patient registry and other safe use conditions. 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical data , or information, in order to resubmit the application for another cycle of FDA review. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the complete response letter, or withdraw the application. If those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post- approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, FDA determines the risk outweighs the benefits of the product or other problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. Such supplements are typically reviewed within 10 months of receipt or 6 months of receipt for priority efficacy supplements.
Orphan Drug Status
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drug candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that costs of research and development of the drug for the indication can be recovered by sales of the drug in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Although there may be some increased communication opportunities, orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a drug candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as if the second applicant demonstrates the clinical superiority of its product or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.
As in the United States, designation as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union, must be made before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan designated product.
The FDA and foreign regulators expect holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of marketing exclusivity for the orphan drug.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for development and review of new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drug products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug may request that the FDA designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. For a Fast Track-designated product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.  Fast Tack designation may be rescinded if FDA determines the program no longer meets the qualifying criteria for Fast Track. 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review on a 6 month, rather than the standard 10 month, timeline. We have received FDA designation as a potential treatment for a rare pediatric disease for the use of SP-2577 in Ewing’s Sarcoma. Should SP-2577 prove to be efficacious in this disease with a positive benefit/risk ratio, we expect to receive a Priority Review Voucher. The Priority Review Voucher is transferable and may be sold.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval under subpart H if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, provides meaningful advantage over existing treatments, and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit or on an intermediate clinical endpoint. If a product qualifies for accelerated approval, the product may be approved based on an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict the drug’s clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will require that a sponsor of a drug product subject to accelerated approval perform an adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trial to confirm clinical benefit. If a sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval trial with “due diligence” FDA may withdraw the drug from the market. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval that promotional materials be submitted in advance of initial dissemination, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
In addition, under the provisions of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”), the FDA established the Breakthrough Therapy Designation which is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is distinct from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA may take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and the FDA will either grant or deny the request.  Breakthrough Therapy designation may be rescinded if the FDA determines the program no longer meets the qualifying criteria for breakthrough therapy.
Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy Designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if we receive Fast Track or Breakthrough designations for its product candidates, the FDA may later decide that its product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification. In addition, these designations may not provide us with a material commercial advantage.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, a product is subject to extensive continuing post-approval requirements. Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of the NDA , the FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS or other surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects’ entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMP. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines,  untitled letters, warning letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; and
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions.
Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application (“CTA”), much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to a single EU portal for harmonized assessment at EU level with additional ethics review on each country’s national level, much like the FDA and an IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, a clinical trial may proceed in that country. To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”). The MAA is similar to the NDA, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements.
Other Healthcare Laws
Although we currently do not have any products on the market, our current and future business operations may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to some of these laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration in cash or in kind that is intended to induce or reward the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and beneficiaries on the other.
Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have found that the Anti-Kickback Statute may be violated if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare program business. In addition, liability may be established without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Violations of this law are punishable by up to ten years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
The federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Persons and entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including: providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing sham consulting fees, grants, free travel and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company’s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. Penalties for federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $13,508 and $27,018 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
The healthcare fraud provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third- party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
Also, many states have analogous laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; laws that require pharmaceutical companies to 
comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to certain healthcare providers; laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; and state laws and local ordinances that require identification or licensing of sales representatives. 
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information, which require the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as certain persons or entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a specified service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we may obtain health information from third parties that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, and other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws, and we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA, and subject to other civil and/or criminal penalties if we obtain, use, or disclose information in a manner not permitted by other privacy and data security and consumer protection laws. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.
The U.S. federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals (and certain other practitioners as of 2022), as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members.
Because we intend to commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we intend to develop a comprehensive compliance program that establishes internal control to facilitate adherence to the rules and program requirements to which we will or may become subject. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, (the “ACA”) has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the 
uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs, among other objectives. With regard to pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA revised the definition of “average manufacturer price” for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. It is unclear how efforts to modify or challenge the ACA or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, will affect our business. Additional legislative and regulatory changes, and further judicial challenges, related to the ACA remain possible. Any such changes or challenges could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. These included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will stay in effect through 2031. Sequestration is currently set at 2% and will increase to 2.25% for the first half of fiscal year 2030, to 3% for the second half of fiscal year 2030, and to 4% for the remainder of the sequestration period that lasts through the first six months of fiscal year 2031.
Additionally, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to types of several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, enacted in 2013, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which will be phased in over several years beginning in 2016. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law. The IRA introduces several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including a limit on annual out-of-pocket costs and a change in manufacturer liability under the program. The IRA sunsets the current Part D coverage gap discount program starting in 2025 and replaces it with a new manufacturer discount program. Failure to pay a discount under this new program will be subject to a civil monetary penalty. In addition, the IRA establishes a Medicare Part B inflation rebate scheme effective January 2023 and a Medicare Part D inflation rebate scheme effective October 2022, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the price of a Part B or Part D drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part B or D inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty. The IRA also creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for Medicare units of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals without generic or biosimilar competition will be capped by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price starting in 2026. Failure to comply with requirements under the drug price negotiation program is subject to an excise tax and/or a civil monetary penalty. Congress continues to examine various policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs with respect to the government health benefit programs and otherwise. The IRA or other legislative changes could impact the market conditions for our product candidates.
It is possible that the ACA, as currently enacted or as may be amended in the future, as well as other healthcare reform measures, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and less favorable payment methodologies, or other downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction or restriction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenues, attain profitability, or successfully commercialize our products.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our product candidates, once approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, private health insurers and managed care organizations. Third-party payors generally decide which drugs they will cover and establish certain reimbursement levels for such drugs. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our product candidates, and any future product candidates, will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, and any future product candidates, will be paid by third-party payors. Additionally, the market for our product candidates, and any future product candidates, will depend significantly on access to third-party payors’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and transparency requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products once approved or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Facilities
Our principal executive offices are in the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas, under a month-to-month lease. This facility consists of approximately 1,000 square feet and accommodates our general and administrative activities. Additionally, we lease laboratory space from Johnson & Johnson, JLABS facility located adjacent to our corporate office. We do not own any real property. We believe that our leased facility is adequate to meet our current needs and that additional facilities will be available on commercially reasonable terms to meet our future needs.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of March 8, 2023, we had 12 full-time employees. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Legal Proceedings
We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
