Item 1.    Business
Company Overview
Shapeways Holdings, Inc. ("Shapeways") is a leading digital manufacturer combining high quality, flexible on-demand manufacturing with purpose-built proprietary software to offer customers an end-to-end digital manufacturing platform on which they can rapidly transform digital designs into physical products. Our manufacturing platform offers customers access to high quality manufacturing from start to finish through automation, innovation and digitization. Our proprietary software, wide selection of materials and technologies, and global supply chain lower manufacturing barriers and accelerate delivery of manufactured parts from prototypes to finished end parts. We combine deep digital manufacturing know-how and software expertise to deliver high quality, flexible on-demand digital manufacturing to a range of customers, from project-focused engineers to large enterprises. 
We have manufacturing facilities in Livonia and Charlotte, Michigan within the United States and in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, we had 38 strategic supply chain partners who provide incremental capacity and production technologies to help us scale with customer demand and support us in efficiently launching new materials and manufacturing technologies. Approximately 36% of our revenue in 2022 was earned through those strategic outsourced supply chain partners.
We support our customers through the design, pre-production, manufacturing and delivery process across a range of industries, materials, part volumes and delivery options. Our software is deeply integrated with our customers’ workflows and often is mission critical to their businesses. We make industrial-grade additive manufacturing accessible by fully digitizing the end-to-end manufacturing process, and by providing a broad range of solutions utilizing 12 additive manufacturing technologies and more than 120 materials and finishes, with the ability to easily scale new innovation. Shapeways has delivered over 24 million parts to over one million customers in over 180 countries as of December 31, 2022. Our platform is agnostic as to manufacturing hardware, materials and design software providers. 
We use our proprietary software to automate production that passes through our manufacturing platform. Our software supports ordering, part analysis, manufacturing planning, pre-production and manufacturing. This software enables us to offer high quality, low-volume, complex part production. In an environment increasingly focused on mass customization and speed of part delivery, we believe that our core competency in low-volume, high-mix production at scale appeals to customers. 
We are making commercially available our software platform, and we launched the first phase of our software offering to third-party manufacturers, under the brand OTTO, in the fourth quarter of 2021. This phase of the rollout involves activities such as creating awareness of the offering and working to ensure the software can interoperate with systems used by current and potential customers. We plan to roll out further phases of this software over the next several years. Additionally, as a complement to our existing software strategy, in April 2022 we acquired MFG.com ("MFG") and MakerOS, Inc. ("MakerOS"), which we believe will both help further our software strategy and help accelerate OTTO's phased rollout. We intend to further commercialize our software as part of our goal to accelerate digital transformation across the manufacturing ecosystem. We believe our software can transform manufacturers globally by easing the digital transformation of traditional manufacturers, particularly small- to medium-sized manufacturers that are not able to invest the capital and time necessary to digitize their processes.
Our Strategy 
The key elements of our strategy for growth are:
•Expand Materials Offering. Our materials portfolio has historically been focused on polymers. We will continue to expand our polymers offerings while adding capabilities in industrial metals, composites and ceramics. We believe that by expanding our materials capabilities and offering a comprehensive and innovative materials portfolio, we will be able to unlock additional opportunities in key markets such as industrial, medical, automotive and aerospace.
•Build a Diverse, Global Customer Base. Our customers today include businesses of all sizes, ranging from small and medium enterprises to Fortune 500 organizations, and span many industries, including aerospace, robotics, consumer products, architecture, gaming, jewelry and medical devices. We have historically served customers based largely in North America and Europe, but we believe there is considerable opportunity to expand into other markets, including Asia, in particular, given the significant levels of manufacturing output in countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and India. We aim to leverage our supply chain partners globally to help us serve customers in areas in which we currently do not have a geographic footprint. As we continue to add customers, we may consider adding our own manufacturing capabilities to serve customers outside of North America and Europe.
•Expand Within and Beyond Additive Manufacturing. We will continue to expand our reach within additive manufacturing through new hardware and expanded materials capabilities. We also plan to expand into other digital manufacturing technologies such as computer numerical control, injection molding and sheet metal, all of which are generally suited to complex, low-volume part production. As our customers scale in volume, they often graduate into these traditional methods; therefore, we believe adding these capabilities will allow us to capture a larger portion of customer spend and grow with our customers’ needs. We plan to leverage our strategic outsourced supply chain partners to support these manufacturing capabilities while we focus our internal manufacturing capabilities on additive manufacturing. 
•Further Commercialize Software Offering. We believe there are opportunities to expand revenue from our software offering. We launched the first phase of our software offering to third-party manufacturers under the brand OTTO in the fourth quarter of 2021 and plan to roll out further phases of this software over the next several years. Additionally, as a complement to our software strategy, in April 2022 we acquired MFG and MakerOS, which we believe will also help accelerate OTTO's phased rollout and drive additional revenues.
•Target Strategic M&A and Partnership Opportunities. The manufacturing industry is highly fragmented, with many traditional and additive manufacturers focused on specific geographies, end-markets, hardware technologies and materials. However, many of these manufacturers have not implemented software to fully digitize their manufacturing process and complete their digital transformation. We plan to grow inorganically by continuing to acquire companies that we believe can help us accelerate our investment in new hardware, materials, and finishing capabilities, as well as new geographies and vertical markets. We believe our expertise in both software and manufacturing makes us well positioned to evaluate such opportunities as they become available. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
•High quality, flexible on-demand manufacturing with proprietary purpose-built software. Our manufacturing platform adjusts to customers’ needs to optimize for speed, cost and quality. Our platform is designed to be highly configurable to meet the needs of our customers and suited for industrial-grade, high quality, low-volume, complex one-part production at scale. We offer high quality, flexible on-demand manufacturing services to deliver finished end parts to our customers in days instead of the weeks or months that are generally required by traditional manufacturers. 
•Platform scalability and quick adaptability to market shifts. We do not depend on the success of any one hardware provider, manufacturing technology, or materials vendor. Our software is designed to be highly configurable and integrate easily with new hardware technologies and materials allowing us to adapt and shift in response to market changes. We expect to continue adding new hardware providers, manufacturing technologies and materials. We believe that we will benefit from innovation in hardware and materials across the additive manufacturing market, which will allow us to offer even more materials to our customers. 
•Enabling platform adoption across customer types and industries. Our customer base is diversified across sizes, industries and geographies. Unlike hardware providers, we have the opportunity to capture business from small to medium sized manufacturers that are unlikely to invest the capital required to deploy and support their own digital manufacturing capabilities. 
•Experienced management team with strong investor support. Our leadership team has decades of category and operational experience, including our engineering, sales and manufacturing teams. We have a proven history in successfully operating and scaling businesses with experience in both technology and manufacturing. Investors with deep domain expertise have supported our business, providing resources and knowledge in the development of our end-to-end digital manufacturing platform and underlying software.

Our software provides automated printability analysis, including file correction and optimization, and can automatically correct common issues with 3D models. If the file is determined to be unprintable based on model geometry, past print successes, and material guidelines, our software enables automated workflows to communicate feedback and printability issues with the customer and offer them paths for resolution. 
Planning. Our software enables production planning across a supply chain network, including both our internal manufacturing facilities and external supply chain outsource partners. Our software automates the assignment and allocation of orders through the supply chain using smart demand allocation, based on cost, manufacturing capacity, part specification, geography, and fulfillment speed. 
Pre-Production. Our software includes manufacturing preparation technology, 2D and 3D tray planning, and machine integration. This allows for optimized asset utilization, materials usage, and machine capacity utilization. 
Manufacturing. Our software includes technology that spans production, asset monitoring, material monitoring, traceability, post-production processes, and certification. This includes robust tools to monitor all steps of the manufacturing process and enable continuous iterations and improvements to adjust to emerging technologies and capabilities. Our platform connects directly with additive manufacturing hardware, providing an integrated platform for monitoring production, maintenance, and printer status across both internal manufacturing and outsource supply chain capabilities. We provide full historical logging capabilities, capturing key touch points from pre-print to production to reduce machine downtime and enable gross margin improvements. 
Our software also supports post-production processes, inspection, and assembly. This enables us to incorporate custom workflows, including improved quality assurance processes and assembly instructions. Our quality assurance feedback process creates a feedback loop between customers and manufacturers to achieve optimal product standards. 
Our software enables global distribution and delivery of finished products direct to the end customer. We ship efficiently via a distribution center network and shipping service integrations. Our customer service team has deep domain expertise in additive manufacturing technology, materials, and production processing and offers end-to-end support to both our customers and their end customers. 
Commercializing Shapeways' Software Offering, OTTO

Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on software development and the evaluation of new manufacturing technologies and materials to add to the Shapeways digital manufacturing platform, both internally and through our strategic outsourced supply chain partners. The digital manufacturing landscape is evolving quickly, with new technologies and materials being brought to market at an increasingly rapid pace. Our research and development, operations and supply chain teams have deep relationships with leading hardware and materials providers, allowing us to stay current on new technologies coming to market. Our research and development team regularly evaluates opportunities in new technologies and materials across a range of factors including customer demand, technology maturity, and production workflow. Additionally, our research and development team work closely with hardware original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and materials providers to ensure production quality and efficiency for our customers. 
Sales and Marketing
Historically, Shapeways has been a self-service digital manufacturing platform growing through our customers and through organic customer acquisition. We are focused on direct sales and marketing efforts to both expand our customer base and retain our existing customer base. We have strong brand recognition due to our long-standing relationships with hardware OEMs and materials providers, who have also served as channels for customer acquisition. Our marketing strategy has historically focused on inbound marketing, and we plan to expand our outbound efforts, primarily focused on larger potential customers and expanding our reach in key verticals. 
Our marketing strategies are focused on supporting sales growth by driving awareness of digital manufacturing and of our platform. We develop comprehensive sales and marketing content, tools, and campaigns, often in parallel with our partner network. Our internal marketing team develops content specifically aimed at both corporate executives and engineers in multiple formats such as case studies, newsletters, and webinars in order to facilitate sales and customer engagement. We regularly release communications through trade press and attend industry events and conferences to augment our vertical market strategy and build strategic relationships. 
Manufacturing and Suppliers 
Our manufacturing capabilities include ISO 9001: 2015, IATF 16949, and ITAR compliant facilities in Livonia and Charlotte, Michigan and in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, as well as a network of outsource supply chain partners, all of which are managed through our proprietary software platform. Our strategic outsourced supply chain partners focus on overflow capacity to help us meet peak demand, as well as support us in efficiently launching new materials and technologies on our platform. Our internal manufacturing and supply chain teams collaborate closely with our strategic outsourced supply chain partners to ensure production quality. 
We source and purchase manufacturing equipment from the leading hardware providers in the additive manufacturing ecosystem, such as 3D Systems, Carbon, EnvisionTec, EOS, ExOne, Formlabs, HP, Origin, Prodways and Desktop Metal. We source materials from these hardware providers as well as from leading chemicals companies such as BASF, DSM/Covestro, and Henkel. As the hardware and materials landscape continues to evolve, we expect to partner with additional hardware and materials providers, either by bringing their capabilities in house or by outsourcing to our strategic outsourced supply chain partners. 
Our Competition 
The industry in which we operate is fragmented and competitive. We compete for customers with a range of digital manufacturing platforms, including Materialise NV, Proto Labs, Inc., service bureaus, digital manufacturing brokers, and small local manufacturers. We believe we are differentiated from our competitors as we provide solutions that combine proprietary software and digital manufacturing capabilities. 
In particular, we believe we compare favorably to other industry participants on the basis of the following competitive factors:

•Proprietary software platform to streamline customer operations; 
•Strategic ecosystem of partner integrations; and 
•Opportunity to expand to traditional manufacturing capabilities and capture more customers’ share of wallet. 
Intellectual Property 
Our ability to drive innovation in the digital manufacturing market depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and software know-how. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, domain names, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as through contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology which includes both nondisclosure and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees and non-disclosure agreements with our vendors and business partners. While unpatented research, development, know-how and engineering skills are important to our business, we pursue patent protection when we believe it is possible and consistent with our overall strategy for safeguarding intellectual property. Our existing patents are expected to expire between 2031 through 2038. 
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 24 issued patents, including 9 United States patents and 15 foreign patents. Shapeways’ patents and patent applications are directed to proprietary technology used in mass customization design tools, part costing, evaluating manufacturability, manufacturing planning, and the manufacturing process. 
We have registered “Shapeways” as a trademark in Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
We have registered “OTTO” as a trademark in the United Kingdom and Israel, and a Notice of Allowance has been issued in connection with the United States registration. “OTTO” trademark registrations are pending in Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Singapore, and Taiwan. 
Seasonality 
Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year due to our sales cycle and seasonal reductions in business activity among our customers, particularly during the summer months in Europe.
Mission, Values and Human Capital 
Our mission is to reshape manufacturing by offering advanced manufacturing solutions and a full suite of software tools and services to enable manufacturing digitization. At Shapeways, we hold ourselves accountable for upholding our corporate responsibility and sustainability practices. Our values govern our internal and external relationships. They set the foundation for what we stand for and the behaviors we promote. And in an ever-changing world, our values remain the moral compass guiding our decision making.
•ONE TEAM: Together We Go Far
•INNOVATE: Fail Fast, Learn Faster
•THINK CRITICALLY: Be Inquisitive
•DRIVE RESULTS: Move the Needle
•BE PASSIONATE: Believe in the Mission
Workforce Demographics 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 207 total employees, of which 191 were full time employees and 16 were part time employees. We also regularly use independent contractors and other temporary employees to supplement our regular staff. We believe that our future success will depend partly on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified, diverse and inclusive personnel.
We are an equal opportunity employer, and we believe that having a diverse workforce drives innovation and resilience. Gender and ethnic diversity, inclusion, and performance go hand in hand. Our workforce is comprised of engineers, technicians, salespeople, and business professionals, of which 30% were racially diverse as of December 31, 2022.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to our employees and their well-being. We are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees around the globe. We provide our employees with a wide range of benefits, including benefits directed to their health, safety, and long-term financial security. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which were in compliance with government regulations. This includes allowing our employees to work remotely as appropriate, while implementing significant safety measures designed to protect the health of anyone entering our facilities.
Total Rewards 
A competitive total rewards program is integral to our success, which depends considerably on our ability to attract and retain highly engaged employees in a dynamic and changing business environment. 
We review base compensation for non-senior level management employees semiannually, and we review equity, benefits, and perquisites annually. To do so, we analyze many factors, including individual and corporate performance, managers’ feedback, and market data from third-party compensation surveys. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ("DEI") 
We believe it is important to foster a culture of belonging and acceptance, and to create a workplace environment free of bias. To do this we are dedicated to driving DEI efforts from committees composed of employees and management of all levels, which are focused on creating business case initiatives championing our diversity strategy. We also hold annual employee, board, and contractor trainings on DEI matters. 
Engagement
Having a highly engaged workforce is necessary for retaining talent and ensuring the continued success of our organization. To do so, we continually gather employee feedback both internally through employee lifecycle surveys (onboarding, satisfaction, pulse, and exit) and externally (Glassdoor). We analyze the data throughout the year to identify our strengths and weaknesses, patterns, and issues. Our goal is to focus on continuous improvement, whether by growing our areas of strength or improving where we are weakest. 
Learning and Development 
We invest in our employees through on-the-job training. We provide all employees with a membership to an online learning platform on their first day, where they have access to thousands of business, creative, and technology courses free of charge. 
Semi-annually we request employees provide feedback on their career goals and aspirations. These surveys focus on employees’ current skills and knowledge, and identify skills gaps and areas of interest for further development. Our human resources team analyzes the responses and collects managers’ input to create individual development plans for every employee. 
Product Responsibility 
We strive to foster a community and marketplace where our customers can convert their ideas into reality. However, that range of expression has its limits. For example, there have been news reports that 3D printers were used to print guns or other weapons. While we implement a weapons and content policy, we have little, if any, control over what objects our customers print using our offerings, and it may be difficult, if not impossible, for us to monitor and prevent customers from printing weapons with our services. While we are not aware of our platform being used to print guns or other weapons, there can be no assurance that we will not be held liable if someone were injured or killed by a weapon or other dangerous object containing a component part or parts manufactured for a customer using one of our offerings.
Employees throughout the sales and production process are trained to identify and reject problematic models. Our manufacturing partners are also required to comply with this policy and inform Shapeways of any non-complying products. 
Workplace Safety 
We are committed to creating a safe, secure, and healthy work environment for our employees. Our focus is on reducing significant safety risks and driving a strong safety culture through communication, awareness, and visible leadership. To assist in achieving this commitment, we provide safety trainings and necessary personal protective equipment (“PPE”) at all facilities. We monitor injury and illness health and safety metrics across our organization to continually evaluate our safety programs to meet the needs of our teams. 
Environmental 
We strive to maximize recycling in our facilities. We recycle metal, plastic, and paper. The minimal hazardous waste streams are handled by reputable third party providers. Beyond this, we have introduced several materials offerings that are plant-based and have high recycling rates within our manufacturing process. One of the benefits of 3D printing is that additive manufacturing uses only the material needed to produce the final part, and as a result there is substantially less production waste than with traditional manufacturing. 
Facilities 
We lease a 17,250 square foot manufacturing facility in Livonia, Michigan which expires in March 2026 and a 100,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Charlotte, Michigan which expires April 2026. We lease a 18,837 square foot facility in Eindhoven, Netherlands, and the lease of this facility expires in September 2024. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and, should the company need additional space, that we will be able to obtain additional space on commercially reasonable terms.
Government Regulations 
We are subject to various laws, regulations and permitting requirements of federal, state, and local authorities, including related to environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, and export controls. We believe that we are in material compliance with all such laws, regulations, and permitting requirements. 
Prior to utilizing Shapeways’ services, all Shapeways customers must agree to Shapeways Terms and Conditions wherein, among other things, customers warrant that any files they upload are their original creation and not copied from any third party or entity. The Shapeways Terms and Conditions also contain additional legal safeguards designed to protect Shapeways from intellectual property infringement by its customers, such as their acknowledgement of their compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations and their indemnification of Shapeways for any claims resulting from their infringement of any third party intellectual property. 
In addition to the Shapeways Terms and Conditions, we implement other safeguards and policies to eliminate or reduce exposure to third party intellectual property infringement. Specifically, we utilize a keyword filter that screens all product listings for specific terms prior to the listings’ publication on the Shapeways marketplace. The keyword filter screens terms (i) related to products where Shapeways has observed substantial prior unauthorized intellectual property use, and (ii) added upon request by certain intellectual property rights holders who have sent Shapeways notices under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”). The keyword filter is periodically updated. Once a listing has been flagged by Shapeways’ keyword filter, the listing enters into a queue for manual review by Shapeways’ content review team and/or the legal department. The content review team and/or the legal department reviews the listing for unauthorized use of intellectual property. 
The primary intellectual property-related statute that applies to our business is the DMCA, which, among other things, provides a copyright safe harbor for online service providers and a formal procedure for submitting copyright takedown notices. The takedown procedure consists of six requirements which establish the proper standing of the individual or organization providing notice, and specify the infringing and infringed material. Once a proper DMCA takedown notice is received, we promptly remove the content and inform the customer of the takedown notice that we received. The customer then has an opportunity to file a counter notice to reinstate the content. Although there is no DMCA equivalent for trademarks, we apply a similar takedown procedure for those instances. 
Environmental Matters 
We are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including, but not limited to, emissions into the air and water and the use, handling, disposal, and remediation of hazardous substances. A certain risk of environmental liability is inherent in our production activities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, the generation, use, storage, registration, handling, and disposal of chemicals and waste materials, the presence of specified substances in electrical products, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, or water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals and other waste materials, and the health and safety of our employees. We are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. 
The export of our products internationally from our production facilities subjects us to environmental laws and regulations concerning the import and export of chemicals and hazardous substances such as the Toxic Substances Control Act and Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals. These laws and regulations require the evaluation and registration of certain chemicals that we ship along with, or that form a part of, our systems and other products. 
Export and Trade Matters 
We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as the laws of the countries where we do business. We are also subject to various trade restrictions, including trade and economic sanctions and export controls, imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations. For example, in accordance with trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the U.S. Department of Commerce, we are prohibited from engaging in transactions involving certain persons and certain designated countries or territories. In addition, our products are subject to export regulations that can involve significant compliance time and may add additional overhead cost to our products. In recent years the United States government has had a renewed focus on export matters related to additive manufacturing. Some of our products are already more tightly controlled for export, and other of our products may in the future become more tightly controlled for export. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and regulatory guidance thereunder have imposed additional controls and may result in the imposition of further additional controls, on the export of certain “emerging and foundational technologies.” Our current and future products may be subject to these heightened regulations, which could increase our compliance costs.
