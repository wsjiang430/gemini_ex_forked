ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
History 
 
Iveda Solutions, Inc. (“Iveda”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada as Charmed Homes, Inc. in June 2006. On October 15, 2009, IntelaSight, d/b/a Iveda, a Washington corporation, became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In December 2010, IntelaSight merged with and into the Company and the Company became the surviving company. Iveda offered the first cloud hosting of streaming and recorded video from security cameras for its customers and real-time remote surveillance service utilizing intervention specialists to watch our customers’ cameras in real time, 24/7.
 
In April 2011, Iveda completed the acquisition of the Taiwan-based company Sole-Vision Technologies (doing business as Iveda Taiwan).
 
Historically, we sold and installed video surveillance equipment, primarily for security purposes and secondarily for operational efficiencies and marketing. We also provided video hosting, in-vehicle streaming video, archiving, and real-time remote surveillance services to a variety of businesses and organizations. While we only used off-the shelf camera systems from well-known camera brands, we now source our own cameras using manufacturers in Taiwan in order for us to be more flexible in fulfilling our customer needs. We now have the capability to provide IP cameras and NVRs based on customer specifications. We still utilize ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum) cameras which is a global standard for the interface of IP-based physical security products.
 
In 2014, we changed our business model from direct project-based sales to licensing our platform and selling IoT hardware to service providers such as telecommunications companies, integrators and other technology resellers already providing services to an existing customer base. Partnering with service providers that have an existing loyal customer base allows us to focus on servicing just a handful of our partners and concentrating on our technology offering. Service providers leverage their end-user infrastructure to sell, bill, and provide customer service for Iveda’s product offering. This business model provides dual revenue streams – one from hardware sales and the other from monthly licensing fees.

Iveda Taiwan, our subsidiary in Taiwan, specializes in deploying new, and integrating existing, video surveillance systems for airports, commercial buildings, government customers, data centers, shopping centers, hotels, banks, and Safe City. Iveda Taiwan combines security surveillance products, software, and services to provide integrated security solutions to the end user. Through Iveda Taiwan, we have access not only to Asian markets but also to Asian manufacturers and engineering expertise. Iveda Taiwan is our research and development arm, working with a team of developers in Taiwan. The company depends on Iveda Taiwan as the majority of the company’s revenues have come from Iveda Taiwan since we acquired them in April 2011.
 
Overview
 
Iveda specializes in AI and digital transformation technologies with real-world applications that improve quality of life and safety worldwide.
 
Iveda, through its wholly-owned subsidiary IntelaSight, Inc. has been offering real-time IP video surveillance technologies to our customers since 2005, prior to its merger with the company. While we still offer video surveillance technologies, our core product line has evolved to include AI intelligent video search technology that provide true intelligence to any video surveillance system and IoT (Internet of Things) devices and platforms. Our evolution is in response to digital transformation demands from many cities and organizations worldwide. Our IvedaAI intelligent video search technology adds critical intelligence to normally passive video surveillance systems. IvedaAI provides AI functions to any IP camera and most popular network video recorders (NVR) and video management systems (VMS). IvedaAI comes with an appliance or server, preconfigured with multiple AI functions based on the end user requirements.
 
In the last few years, the concept of a smart city has been a hot topic among cities across the globe. With little to no human interaction, technology increases efficiency, expedites decision making, and reduces response time. Dwindling public safety budgets and resources have necessitated the transformation. More and more municipalities are using next-generation technologies to improve the safety and security of its citizens. Our response is our complete suite of IoT technologies, including AI intelligent video search technology, smart sensors, tracking devices, video surveillance systems, and smart power.
 
Technology / Products
 
Iveda offers AI intelligent video search, smart utility, smart sensors, gateways and trackers, and IoT platforms (Products).
 
IvedaAI
 
IvedaAI consists of deep-learning video analytics software running in a computer/server environment that can either be deployed at an edge level or data center for centralized cloud model. We combined hardware and artificial intelligence software for fast and efficient video search for objects stored in an external (NVR) or storage device and live streaming video data from any IP camera.
 
IvedaAI works with any ONVIF-compliant IP cameras and most popular NVR/VMS (Video Management System) platforms, enabling accurate search across dozens to thousands of cameras in less than 1 second. IvedaAI products are designed to maximize efficiency, save time, and cut cost. Instead of watching hours of video recording after-the-fact, users can set up alerts.

On October 15, 2009, we completed a reverse merger with IntelaSight, Inc. doing business as Iveda Solutions, a Washington corporation (“IntelaSight”), pursuant to which IntelaSight became a wholly owned subsidiary of our company. Thereafter, we changed our name to Iveda Corporation. After the reverse merger, all of our operations were conducted under IntelaSight until December 31, 2010, at which time IntelaSight merged with and into our company, with our company surviving. At that time, we changed our name to Iveda Solutions, Inc. On April 30, 2011, we completed our acquisition of Iveda Taiwan, which was incorporated in the Republic of China (Taiwan) on July 5, 1999.
