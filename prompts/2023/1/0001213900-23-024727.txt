Item 1. Business



LogicMark, Inc. (NASDAQ: LGMK) (“LogicMark”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) provides personal emergency response systems (“PERS”), health communications devices, and Internet of Things (“IoT”) technology that creates a connected care platform. The Company’s devices provide people with the ability to receive care at home and age independently. The Company’s PERS devices incorporate two-way voice communication technology directly in the medical alert pendant and provide this life-saving technology at a customer-friendly price point aimed at everyday consumers. These PERS technologies are sold direct-to-consumer through the Company’s eCommerce website, through dealers and distributors, as well as through the United States Veterans Health Administration (the “VHA”).



The Company was awarded a contract by the U.S. General Services Administration that enables the Company to distribute its products to federal, state, and local governments (the “GSA Agreement”).



Overview



LogicMark builds technology to remotely check, manage and monitor a loved one’s health and safety. The Company is focused on modernizing remote monitoring to help people stay safe and live independently longer. We believe there are five trends driving the demand for better remote monitoring systems:

1. | The “Silver Tsunami”. With 10,000 Baby Boomers turning 65 daily in the U.S. every day, there will be more older adults than children under 18 for the first time in the near future. With 72 million “Baby Boomers” in the United States, they are not only the largest generation but the wealthiest. Unlike generations before them, Baby Boomers are reliant and comfortable with technology. Most of them expect to live independently in their current home or downsize to a smaller home as they get older.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Shift to At-Home Care. As it stands, the current healthcare system is unprepared for the resource strain and is shifting much of the care elderly patients used to receive at a hospital or medical facility to the patient’s home. The rise of digital communication to support remote care exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for connected and remote monitoring devices is more necessary and in-demand than ever before.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Rise of Data and IoT. Doctors and clinicians are asking patients to track more and more vital signs. Whether it’s how they’re reacting to medication or tracking blood sugar, patients and their caregivers are participating in their healthcare in unprecedented ways. Consumers are using data collected from connected devices like never before. This data can be used to prevent health emergencies as technology companies use machine learning (“ML”) / artificial intelligence (“AI”) to learn patient patterns and alert the patient and their care team of potential emergencies.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Lack of Healthcare Workers. It’s estimated that 20% of healthcare workers have quit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many healthcare workers who are currently working are suffering from burnout, exhaustion, and demoralization due to the COVID pandemic. There were not enough healthcare workers to support our entire population throughout the pandemic, let alone enough to support our elderly population. The responsibility of taking care of elderly family members is increasingly falling on the family, and they need help. 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Rise of the Care Economy. The term “Care Economy” refers to the money people contribute to care for people until the end of their lives; the Care Economy offsets the deficiencies within the healthcare system and the desire to age in place. There has been little innovation in the industry because the majority of PERS are operated by home security companies. It is not their main line of business, and they have little expertise in developing or launching machine-learning algorithms or artificial intelligence.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Together, we believe these trends have produced a large and growing market opportunity for LogicMark. The Company enjoys a strong base of business with the VHA and plans to expand to other government services after being awarded the five-year GSA Agreement in July 2021.

The PERS Opportunity



PERS, also known as a medical alert or medical alarm system, is designed to detect a threat that requires attention and then immediately contacts a trusted family member and/or the emergency medical workforce. Unlike conventional alarm systems which consist of a transmitter and are activated in the case of an emergency, PERS transmits signals to an alarm monitoring medical team, which then departs for the location where the alarm was activated. These types of medical alarms are traditionally utilized by the disabled, elderly or those living alone.



The PERS market is generally divided into direct-to-consumer and healthcare customer channels. With the advent of new technologies, demographic changes, and our five previously stated trends in healthcare, an expanded opportunity exists for LogicMark to provide at-home and on-the-go health and safety solutions to both customer channels.



For LogicMark, growing the healthcare opportunity relies on partnering with organizations such as government, Medicaid, hospitals, insurance companies, managed care organizations, affiliates, and dealers. Partners can provide leads at no cost for new and replacement customers, have significant buying power and can provide collaboration on product research and development.



Our longstanding partnership with the VHA is a good example. LogicMark has been selling PERS devices to the U.S. government for many years. The signing of the GSA Agreement in 2021 further strengthens our partnership with the government and expands our ability to capture new sales. We envision a focus on growing the healthcare channel during 2023 given lower acquisition costs and higher customer unit economics.



In addition to the healthcare channel, LogicMark also expects to grow sales volume through it’s direct-to-consumer channel. It is estimated that approximately 70% of PERS customers fall into the direct-to-consumer category. Family members regularly conduct research and purchase PERS devices for their loved ones through online websites. The Company expects traditionally higher customer acquisition costs to be balanced by higher sales growth and lower sales cycles with an online channel.



With the growth in IoT devices, data driven solutions using AI and ML are helping guide the growth of the PERS industry. In both the healthcare and direct-to-consumer channels, product offerings can include 24/7 emergency response, fall detection, activity monitoring, medication management, caregiver and patient portals, concierge services, telehealth, vitals monitoring, and customer dashboards. These product offerings are primarily delivered via mobile and home-base equipment. LogicMark will also pursue research and development partnerships to grow our product offering.



Our PERS Products



LogicMark produces a range of products within the PERS market as a result of the Company’s 2016 acquisition of LogicMark, LLC, the former wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and now a division of the Company. The Company has differentiated itself by offering “no monthly fee” products, which only require a one-time purchase expense, instead of a contract with recurring monthly charges.



The “no monthly fee” products contact family, friends or 911 directly, eliminating the recurring monthly fee from a monitoring center, making it one of the most cost-effective options on the market. LogicMark offers both traditional (i.e., landline), mPERS (i.e., cell-based), and Internet (i.e., Wi-Fi-based) solutions. Our no monthly fee products are sold primarily through the VHA.

In the past, LogicMark has offered monitored products that were exclusively sold to consumers by monitored dealers and distributors. LogicMark sold its devices to the dealers and distributors, who in turn offered the monitoring component to their consumers as part of their product and service offerings. The dealer would own the device and then lease the PERS hardware to the consumer. The dealers would charge the consumers a monthly monitoring fee for the lease of the PERS equipment and associated monitoring service. These products were monitored by a third-party central station. During the first quarter of 2023, the Company began selling the LifeSentry Monitored PERS product direct-to-consumers through the Company’s website.

Industry Competition



LogicMark is focused on expanding its market position through both the direct-to-consumer and healthcare channels. The Company enjoys a strong business relationship with the VHA, through which it serves veterans who suffer from chronic conditions that often require emergency assistance. We believe that this relationship, coupled with the GSA Agreement, gives LogicMark a solid foundation to grow its healthcare channel business.



As technology and innovation have improved, barriers to entry have been lowered in the PERS sector. This has resulted in a highly fragmented market with many competitors, mostly privately held, who are solely dedicated to providing PERS. Other competitors, many of which are divisions of large publicly traded companies, include PERS as one of several business lines. In these instances, their PERS divisions grow both organically and through acquisitions or roll ups of smaller, private PERS companies. Competition is also found from companies in the healthcare, telecommunications and home and commercial security sectors.



Competitors may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources, broader distribution networks, a larger portfolio of intellectual property and customers. Success in acquiring new customers is dependent on a variety of factors, including brand and reputation, market visibility, service and product capabilities, quality, price, and the ability to identify and sell to prospective customers. Our approach is to grow our team and product capabilities as well as key partnerships. These steps are expected to help us benefit from the favorable trends and growing demand for PERS in the direct-to-consumer and healthcare channels.



Our Care Economy and Business Strategy



2022 was a rebuilding year for the Company after the COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 and 2021 led to VHA hospital and clinic closures and their refocus away from patient long-term care to dealing with the immediacy of COVID-19 infections. In 2021, the Company also underwent a change in management and conducted multiple financing offerings to prepare us to build for the future. In 2022, we continued our plan to establish a foundation for future growth by building a durable model, with a recurring revenue base to generate significant cash flow, and by developing innovative software and services solutions to expand into the broader Caring Economy. In 2023, we plan to continue investing in a number of new verticals, such as consumer, pro-care / healthcare and corporate benefits lines of business and intend to expand further into our established government business.

The number of Americans 65 and older make up more than 23% of the US population (over 80 million people) and more than 90% of those over 50 would like to age at home. We believe that our existing PERS and medical alert systems provide this “silver tsunami” of seniors seeking to continue living independently, stay safe, comfortable, and content in their own home, the ability to do so. Our customers’ increasingly mobile and active lifestyles have created new opportunities for us in the fast-growing market for self-monitored products and mobile technology. We plan to continue to grow our unmonitored PERS business, which for those who are on low or fixed income and/or require long charge devices, is potentially a life-saving product. However, we see strong opportunities to build and expand our business into monitored services. We plan to expand our cell-based (mPERS) product line to provide a multi-layer safety support using CPaaS, LogicMark’s Caring Platform as a Service, which allows us to integrate with various third-party connected and wearable devices so that we can serve our customers whether they are at home or on-the-go.



We plan to continue to expand our business into the “aging with independence” market as well as expanding further into the Caring Economy by providing enhanced products and services that make the caring for loved ones easier. One in four millennials as well as more than half of GenX are taking care of loved ones with very little, but much needed, assistance. Further, as the in-home professional care business continues to expand, we believe this is an opportunity for LogicMark to extend its products and services to meet the increasing needs of the growing Caring Economy. We intend to do so by expanding the tools for caretakers to better manage both the care of their elderly living independent lives, and to provide mobile and personal safety to others in their care circle so they too can feel safe on the go. We want our products and services to be available for anyone with personal safety concerns, including children or students who are navigating new environments and social situations for the first time.



Our Intellectual Property



Our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on our ability to protect our proprietary information. We currently rely and will continue to rely primarily on patents and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights. Since the Company’s acquisition in 2016, we have filed thirty-two patent applications, twenty-one of which have been awarded to date.



We enter into confidentiality agreements with all our employees and consultants and maintain control over access to and distribution of our technology, software, and other proprietary information.



Government Regulations



In order to sell any products to the U.S. government, companies are required to obtain approval from the GSA and must obtain a GSA authorization number. The Company obtained GSA approval to sell its products to the federal government when it was awarded the five-year GSA Agreement in July 2021. Our U.S. government contracts are subject to a large number of federal regulations and oversight requirements. Compliance with the array of government regulations requires extensive record keeping and the maintenance of complex policies and procedures relating to all aspects of our business, as well as to work performed for us by any subcontractors. In addition, government contracts are subject to audits and oversight by government inspectors at various points in the contracting process.



In addition, our devices are required to meet Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) approval, specifically relating to FCC Part 15 requirements for Class B digital devices. FCC Part 15 covers the regulations under which a device emits radio frequency energy by radiation, and the technical specifications, administrative requirements, and other conditions relating to the marketing of FCC Part 15 devices. The FCC’s definition of a Class B Digital Device is one which is marketed for use in a residential environment, and FCC Part 15 compliance means that our devices may not cause harmful interference, must accept interference from other devices, and all device changes must be approved by the manufacturer. All of our devices are FCC Part 15 compliant Class B digital devices. All of our devices are manufactured to never exceed FCC specific absorption rate (SAR) limitations for exposure to radio frequency emissions for body worn devices.
