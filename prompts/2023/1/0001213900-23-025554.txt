ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESSIndustry Overview



The biotechnology industry focuses on developing breakthrough products and technologies to combat various types of diseases through efficient industrial manufacturing process. Biotechnology is an important business sector in the world’s economies and plays a key role in human health. Companies engaged in biotechnology generally require large amounts of capital investment for their research & development activities and it may take up to tens of years to develop and commercialize a new drug or a new medical device. ABVC (“we” or the “Company”) is an early stage biotechnology company with a pipeline of seven new drugs and one medical device under development, all of which are licensed from related parties of the Company.
Our Mission



We devote our resources to building a sophisticated biotech company and becoming a pioneer in the biopharmaceutical industry. Dr. Howard Doong, our Chief Executive Officer, and Dr. Tsung-Shann Jiang, the founder and majority shareholder of the Company, understand the challenges and opportunities of the biotech industry and intend to provide therapeutic solutions to significant unmet medical needs and to improve health and quality of human life by developing innovative botanical drugs to treat central nervous system (“CNS”) and oncology/ hematology diseases.
Business Overview



As of the date of this Report, the Company’s minimal revenue has come from the sale of CDMO services through BioKey. However, the Company’s focus is on developing a pipeline of products by carefully tracking new medical discoveries or medical device technologies in research institutions in the Asia-Pacific region. Pre-clinical, disease animal model and Phase I safety studies are examined closely by the Company’s scientists and other specialists known to the Company to identify drugs or medical devices that it believes demonstrate efficacy and safety based on the Company’s internal qualifications. Once a drug or medical device is shown to be a good candidate for further development and ultimately commercialization, ABVC licenses the drug or medical device from the original researchers and introduces the drug or medical device clinical trial plan to highly respected principal investigators in the United States, Australia and Taiwan. In almost all cases, ABVC has found that research institutions in each of those countries are eager to work with the Company to move forward with Phase II clinical trials.

GMP Manufacturing



ABVC owns a certified GMP manufacturing facility, through BioKey, that is qualified to deliver small quantities of drugs for use by its clients in clinical trials from Phase I to Phase III. The GMP facility can manufacture direct API or blend fill-in capsules, manual and automated encapsulation, wet granulation or tray drying process, tablet compression and coating process, packaging solid dosage forms for ANDA and IND submission. 



The BioKey facility consists of a GMP suite, product development area, analytical laboratory, food processing area, caged GMP storage area, receiving area and two warehouses. The facility was remodeled  in December 2008 and received its first drug manufacturing license in June 2009. ABVC’s current drug manufacturing license allows it to manufacture drug products under IND for human clinical trials until the expiration of the license on December 2, 2024.



In 2022, BioKey began manufacturing a dietary supplement based on the maitake mushroom.  The mushrooms, supplied by Shogun Maitake Canada, Co. Ltd., are grown in a controlled temperature and humid environment free of pesticides and chemicals. Initially, sales of the new supplement in the US and Canada will be targeted to high end grocery stores and worldwide via online distribution. While there are many mushroom-based supplements currently available to customers, BioKey believes its new line has a significant competitive advantage since the purity and consistency of the mushrooms themselves exceeds any maitake mushrooms currently available and the extraction process employed by BioKey delivers a particularly strong dose. The maitake mushroom is rich in bioactive polysaccharides, especially beta-glucans. These polysaccharides have well-documented immune-protecting and antitumor properties. BioKey has developed both a tablet and a liquid version of the supplement. GMP manufacturing of bulk quantities Maitake mushroom tablets and Maitake mushroom drinks were completed in 2 and 1 batches respectively for commercial launches in Taiwan and Canada in 2022.



Beta-glucans in maitake mushrooms has been shown to reduce cholesterol, resulting in improved artery functionality and overall better cardiovascular health that lowers the risk of heart disease. Further, studies have shown that the beta-glucans in maitake mushroom have the effect of strengthening the immune system1. In a trial of postmenopausal breast cancer patients, oral administration of a maitake extract was shown to have immunomodulatory effects. In a different trial done at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, maitake extracts were shown to enhance neutrophil and monocyte function in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. It boosts production of lymphokines (protein mediators) and interleukins (secreted proteins) resulting in improved immune response. Further, beta-glucans, has been shown in clinical trials to lower blood glucose levels thereby helping to activate insulin receptors, while reducing insulin resistance in diabetes management.



BioKey has entered into a three-year distribution agreement with Define Biotech Co. Ltd., a Taiwan-based pharmaceutical marketing company that focuses on sales of drugs, dietary supplements and medical products in the Asia-Pacific region. The agreement grants Define Biotech the exclusive right to distribute this new dietary supplement in China and Taiwan in exchange for the commitment to purchase $3.0 million worth of the new product over the three-year period.

1. | ABV-1504 to treat Major Depressive Disorder (“MDD”) 
---+--------------------------------------------------------




We are developing and researching ABV-1504, a botanical reuptake inhibitor that targets norepinephrine. Prior to clinical trials, we conducted radioligand-binding assay tests on ABV-1504. Radioligand-binding assays are used to characterize the binding effects of a drug to its target receptor. In the case of ABV-1504, the receptors of radioligand-binding assays are norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. The radioligand-binding assay test on norepinephrine was conducted from May 3 to May 8, 2007 and the radioligand-binding assay test on dopamine and serotonin was administered from November 26 to December 5, 2007. The result of radioligand-binding assay to norepinephrine of ABV-1504was 2.102 μg/ml of IC50, which indicated ABV-1504’s high inhibitory efficiency on norepinephrine. The results of radioligand-binding assay to dopamine and serotonin were not as good as to norepinephrine, which indicated lower inhibitory efficiency. Because research has shown that norepinephrine inhibitors can alleviate the level of depression, our research team saw ABV-1504’s potential to treat depression and decided to commence the clinical trial process of ABV-1504. 



In 2013, ABVC successfully completed the Phase I clinical trial of ABV-1504. The primary objective of the Phase I study was to assess the safety profile of ABV-1504. The safety endpoint was assessed based on the results of physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory data, electrocardiograms (“ECG”), Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale evaluation and a number of adverse events during the study period. We began recruiting healthy people as subjects for the Phase I trial in Taiwan on October 30, 2012. For the Phase I trial, we screened 85 healthy volunteers at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital and eventually enrolled 30 people as trial subjects. We divided the subjects into four cohort groups and administered ABV-1504oral capsules of 380 mg, 1140 mg, 2280 mg, and 3800 mg to the subjects in each cohort group, respectively. BioLite visited the first subject the first time on November 13, 2012 and the last subject the last time on July 5, 2013. During the said period, no subject had a serious adverse event nor discontinued the trial due to any adverse events. ABVC did not observe any clinically significant findings in physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram, laboratory measurements, and C-SSRS throughout the treatment period. However, ABVC observed the following mild adverse events: two subjects with flatulence and one subject with constipation in the single-dose 380mg cohort of seven subjects; one subject with somnolence and one subject with stomatitis ulcer in the single-dose 2,280 mg cohort. Comparatively, two subjects with somnolence and one subject with stomatitis ulcer were observed in the placebo group of seven subjects. ABVC did not observe any suicidal ideation or behavior throughout the trial period. ABV-1504’s Phase I clinical trial results reflected that the oral administration of ABV-1504 to healthy volunteers was safe and well-tolerated at the dose levels of from 380 mg to 3,800 mg.

ABVC received an IND approval to proceed with the Phase II clinical trial of ABV-1504 from the F.D.A. in March 2014 and an IND approval of its Phase II trial from the Taiwan F.D.A. in June 2014. For the Phase II trial, BioLite administered oral capsules to 72 MDD patients (the trial subjects) in a randomized, double-blind study with a placebo control group to assess ABV-1504’s efficacy and safety profile, primarily in accordance with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (“MADRS”). ABVC via BioLite began recruiting Phase II subjects in March 2015 at the following study sites, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei City Hospital-Songde Branch, Tri-Service General Hospital, Wan Fang Hospital and started recruiting MDD patients at Stanford Depression Research Clinic. The first five sites are in Taiwan and the last one is in the United States. The primary endpoint of the Phase II trial is to see changes of the subjects’ MADRS total scores from the baseline scores of the placebo subjects within the first six weeks. The secondary objectives of the Phase II trial are to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of ABV-1504 on other rating scales with secondary endpoints of (i) demonstrating changes in MADRS total scores from baseline scores within the second to seventh weeks and (ii) showing changes in the total scores on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale (DSSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) from the baseline scores in the second, fourth, sixth and seventh week. ABVC plans to measure the percentages of partial responders (subjects with a 25% to 50% decrease of total MADRS scores from the baseline score) and responders (subjects with 50% or more decrease of total MADRS scores from the baseline score) by the second, fourth, sixth and seventh week. Additionally, ABVC intends to monitor the subjects’ performance in accordance with the Safety Assessments and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale from the screening stage to each subject’s last visit as well as to analyze the differences in the mean changes of MADRS, HAM-D-17, HAM-A, DSSS, CGI and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores of the subjects administered with ABV-1504 and the placebo group in the second, fourth, sixth and seventh week.



On May 23, 2019, the Company announced the Phase II clinical study results of ABV-1504. The clinical study results showed that PDC-1421, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of ABV-1504, met the pre-specified primary endpoint of the Phase II clinical trial and significantly improved the symptoms of MDD. The Phase II clinical study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial, in which sixty (60) adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe MDD were treated with PDC-1421 in either low dose (380 mg) or high dose (2 x 380 mg) compared with placebo administration, three times a day for six weeks. PDC-1421 high dose (2 x 380 mg) met the pre-specified primary endpoint by demonstrating a highly significant 13.2-point reduction in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score by Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis, averaged over the 6-week treatment period (overall treatment effect) from baseline, as compared to 9.2-point reduction of the placebo group. By Per-Protocol (PP) analysis, PDC-1421 showed a dose dependent efficacy toward MDD in which high dose (2 x 380 mg) gave 13.4-point reduction in MADRS total score from baseline and low dose (380 mg) gave 10.4-point reduction as compared to a 8.6-point in the placebo group. Based on the trial results as set forth above, the Company has decided to use the high dose formula for ABV-1504’s Phase III clinical trial.




2. | ABV-1505 to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”) 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------




We developed the ADHD indication from the same API of ABV-1504. Also, ABV-1505 shares similar pharmaceutical mechanism of action as ABV-1504 in as much as ABV-1505 shows the potential of increasing the level of norepinephrine in the human’s nervous system by inhibiting its reabsorption. Because of ABV-1505’s sufficient similarity with ABV-1504, in January 2016 the FDA approved our IND application to conduct ABV-1505’s Phase II clinical trial based on its preclinical research and the Phase I trial results of ABV-1504.



For the ADHD Phase II trial, ABVC plans to recruit a maximum of 105 ADHD patients as trial subjects in the United States and Taiwan, to whom ABVC intends to administer ABV-1505 oral capsules. ABVC has designed a randomized, double-blind dose escalation study with a placebo-controlled group to assess the efficacy and safety profile of ABV-1505, primarily against the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (“ADHD-RS-IV”). The primary endpoint of the Phase II trial is a 40% or higher improvement on the ADHD-RS-IV from the respective baseline scores within a period of up to eight weeks. The secondary objective is to determine the efficacy and safety profile of ABV-1505 on other rating scales with secondary endpoints of (i) improvements of the total ADHD symptom scores from the respective baseline scores on the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Self Report: Short Version (“CAARS-S:S”) 18-Item for a treatment period of eight weeks at maximum; and (ii) achievement of scores of two or lower on both the Clinical Global Impression-ADHD- Severity (“CGI-ADHD-S”) and Clinical Global Impression-ADHD-Improvement (“CGI-ADHD-I”) from the subjects’ respective baseline scores. The University of California San Francisco (“UCSF”) initiated the Phase II, Part 1 clinical trial entitled “A Phase II Tolerability and Efficacy Study of PDC-1421 Treatment in Adult Patients with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Part I, on January 14, 2020. The Part 1 trial is a single center, open label, dose escalation evaluation with two dosage levels in six subjects. Six subjects were initially evaluated for safety and efficacy assessments at low-dose (1 capsule of PDC-1421, three times a day (TID)) for 28 days. A safety checkpoint was evaluated at day-28 for entering the high-dose (2 capsules TID). The subjects who passed the checkpoint were evaluated for safety and efficacy assessments at high-dose (2 capsules of PDC-1421 TID) for 28 days. On July 15, 2020, the last patient last visit (LPLV) marked the final step toward the completion of the ABV-1505 Phase II Part I clinical trial for the treatment of adult ADHD. On October 24, 2020, a full clinical study report (CSR) of ABV-1505 Phase II Part I clinical trial was issued. The study results showed that the PDC-1421 Capsule was safe, well tolerated and efficacious during its treatment and the follow-up period with six adult patients. For the primary endpoints, the percentages of improvement in ADHD-RS-IV score from baseline to 8 weeks treatment were 83.3% (N=5) in the ITT population and 80.0% (N=4) in the PP population. Both low and high doses of PDC-1421 Capsule met the primary end points by passing the required 40% population in ADHD-RS-IV test scores. Overall, the results from this study, which demonstrate the therapeutic value of PDC-1421, support further Phase II Part II clinical development of ABV-1505 for the treatment of adult ADHD.

The Phase II Part II study with its clinical protocol entitled “A Phase II Tolerability and Efficacy Study of PDC-1421 Treatment in Adult Patients with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Part II” is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel three-groups with a maximum 99 subjects to be enrolled. This study was started at five Taiwan medical centers beginning in April 2022. The University of California, San Francisco site will be initiated in the 1st quarter of 2023.




3. | ABV-1601 to treat Depression in Cancer Patients 
---+----------------------------------------------------




We developed a treatment for depression in cancer patient from the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as ABV-1504. ABV-1601 shares similar pharmaceutical mechanisms of action as ABV-1504 in that ABV-1601 shows the potential of increasing the level of norepinephrine in the human nervous system by inhibiting its reabsorption. Due to ABV-1601’s similarity with ABV-1504, the FDA approved our ABV-1601-001 clinical protocol under the same IND as for ABV-1504 (IND 112567) in December 2018.



For the Phase II trial of ABV-1601, ABVC plans to recruit a maximum number of 54 cancer patients with depression, to whom ABVC intends to administer ABV-1601 oral capsules. ABVC is engaging the Principal Investigator at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the U.S. which designed a randomized, double-blind dose escalation study with a comparator-controlled group to assess the efficacy and safety profile of ABV-1601, primarily against Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. The primary endpoint of the Phase II trial is a change in MADRS, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), subscales (HADS-A and HADS-D), and Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) total scores from baseline in patients taking PDC-1421 compared to the comparator. As of the date of this report, the Part I of Phase II clinical protocol, which is an open trial, has been approved by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center IRB Committee. This study will be initiated on March 31, 2023.

1. | ABV-1702 to treat Myelodysplastic Syndrome (“MDS”) 
---+-------------------------------------------------------




ABVC started the preparation for ABV-1702’s Phase II clinical trials after receiving its IND approval from the FDA in July 2016. ABVC plans to recruit fifty-two subjects in the United States who are diagnosed with either IPSS int-1, IPSS int-2 or high risk MDS or CMML and may take azacitidine as part of the subjects’ prescription. Azacitidine is an FDA-approved drug used to treat MDS. ABVC intends to administer ABV-1702 in the oral liquid form along with azacitidine. The Phase II trial is divided into two parts, where Part 1 is to determine the safety and recommended dose level (“RDL”) of ABV-1702 in combination with azacitidine and Part 2 is to determine whether ABV-1702 under the established RDL reduces bactericidal and fungicidal infection in the subjects’ respiratory systems. The primary endpoint of Part 1 Phase II trial is to assess the safety and RDL profile of ABV-1702 administered with azacitidine by measuring ABV-1702’s prohibited toxicity. The secondary endpoints of Phase II Part 1 are to determine the safety, time-to-first infection after first dose (Day 1) of the first azacitidine treatment cycle, reduction in treatment requirements and duration of infections, enhancement of immune responses, improvements of response rates, progression, and survival rates of the subjects under such ABV-1702 - azacitidine combination treatment. The primary endpoint of Part 2 of Phase II is to determine whether ABV-1702 under the established RDL reduces bactericidal and fungicidal infection risks in the subjects’ respiratory systems in combination with azacitidine as compared to the control group with incidence of infections and incidence/frequency of inpatient hospitalization due to infections. The secondary endpoints of Part 2 of Phase II are to determine the safety, time-to-first infection after first dose (Day 1) of the first azacitidine treatment cycle, reduction in required dosage and duration of infection, enhancement of immune responses, improvement of response rate, progression, and survival rates of the subjects under the trial conditions. In April 2016, BioLite submitted a letter to the FDA in response to its queries with additional information about the proposed Phase II trial. 



The Company expects to begin Phase II clinical trials of ABV-1702 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is actively looking for qualified principal investigators and an appropriate site for the study and therefore the timing cannot be guaranteed.




2. | ABV-1703 to treat Pancreatic Cancer 
---+----------------------------------------




ABVC developed a new indication for Pancreatic Cancer from Maitake Extract, which is named as ABV-1703 and out licensed it to Rgene for the preparation of its IND application with the FDA. On August 25, 2017, ABV-1703’s Phase II trial was approved by FDA. Pursuant to the ABVC-Rgene Co-development Agreement, ABVC is responsible for coordinating and conducting the clinical trials of ABV-1703 globally and Rgene is responsible for preparing the related FDA applications. As of the date of this report, we are engaging Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the U.S. to conduct the Phase II clinical trial and plan to initiate the Phase II trial in the third quarter of 2023. We plan to submit ABV-1703’s Phase II clinical trial IND to the Taiwan FDA after we commence the clinical trials in the United States.

3. | ABV- 1501 Triple Negative Breast Cancer - Combination therapy for Triple Negative Breast Cancer (“TNBC”) 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ABV- 1501 is developed from BLI-1401-2 whose active pharmaceutical ingredient is Yukiguni Maitake Extract 404. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (“MSKCC”) conducted the Phase I clinical trial of a polysaccharide extract from Grifola frondosa (Maitake mushroom), which is very similar to Yukiguni Maitake Extract 404. The Phase I trial focused on Grifola frondosa extract’s immunological effects on breast cancer patients. The results of the Phase I trial showed that oral administration of a polysaccharide extract from Maitake mushroom is associated with both immunologically stimulatory and inhibitory measurable effects in peripheral blood.

On November 7, 2016, the application of Phase I clinical trial prepared and submitted by BioFirst was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee, Australia (“HREC”), and on November 14, 2016, it was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, Australia (“TGA”).



We successfully finished the Phase I clinical trial of ABV-1701 at Sydney Retina Clinic and Day Surgery, a clinic located in Sydney, Australia. This was the only site for this Phase I clinical trial. The trial started on November 17, 2016, and was completed with positive results in July 2018. The Protocol Title is “A Phase I, single center, safety and tolerability study of Vitargus in the treatment of Retinal Detachment.”



The primary endpoint of this Phase I clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravitreal dose of Vitargus in patients as a vitreous substitute during vitrectomy surgery for retinal detachment. Intravitreal is a route of administration of a drug or other substance, in which the substance is delivered into the eyes. The secondary endpoint of this Phase I clinical trial is to assess retinal attachment and Virtagus degradation at day 90 and to assess best corrected visual acuity (“BVCA”) after vitrectomy surgery. BVCA refers to the best possible vision a person can achieve. The primary and second endpoints are required by HREC for the purpose of evaluation of our Phase I clinical trial application. We enrolled an aggregate number of 10 patient subjects in this trial. On November 17, 2016, we received the approval from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for the first subject, and nine more subjects were enrolled thereafter. In this trial, Vitargus was injected into the vitreous cavity of vitrectomised eyes, whose vitreous gel was removed from the vitreous cavity after a vitrectomy surgery. On August 24, 2020, a full clinical study report (CSR) of ABV-1701 Phase I clinical trial was issued. The study results showed that ABV-1701 (Vitargus) was well-tolerated as a vitreous substitute without any apparent toxicity to ocular tissues. Further, there was no indication of an increased overall safety risk with Vitargus. For efficacy, participants showed significant improvement in visual acuity. The optical properties of Vitargus allowed the patients to see well and facilitated visualisation of the fundus immediately following surgery. In addition, since Vitargus set as a stable semisolid gel adhering to the retina, it maintained its position without requiring the patient to remain face-down following surgery.





8







ABV-1701, Vitargus® in vitrectomy surgery, Phase II Study will be started in the 2nd quarter of 2023. A total of four (4) study sites in Australia and Thailand join this multi-nation and multi-site clinical study. We plan to extend the Phase II study to a Phase III pivotal study by adding sites in Taiwan, USA, and China in 2024.




II. | Co-development Agreement with Rgene 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




On May 26, 2017, American BriVision Corporation entered into a co-development agreement (the “Co-Dev Agreement”) with Rgene Corporation (the “Rgene”), a related party under common control by controlling beneficiary shareholder of YuanGene Corporation and the Company. Pursuant to Co-Dev Agreement, BriVision and Rgene agreed to co-develop and commercialize ABV-1507 HER2/neu Positive Breast Cancer Combination Therapy, ABV-17 Pancreatic Cancer Combination Therapy and ABV-1527 Ovary Cancer Combination Therapy. Under the terms of the Co-Dev Agreement, Rgene is required to pay the Company $3,000,000 in cash or stock of Rgene with equivalent value by August 15, 2017. The payment is for the compensation of BriVision’s past research efforts and contributions made by BriVision before the Co-Dev Agreement was signed and it does not relate to any future commitments made by BriVision and Rgene in this Co-Dev Agreement. In addition to the $3,000,000, the Company is entitled to receive 50% of the future net licensing income or net sales profit earned by Rgene, if any, and any development costs shall be equally shared by both BriVision and Rgene.



By June 1, 2017, the Company had delivered all research, technical, data and development data to Rgene. Since both Rgene and the Company are related parties and under common control by a controlling beneficiary shareholder of YuanGene Corporation and the Company, the Company has recorded the full amount of $3,000,000 in connection with the Co-Dev Agreement as additional paid-in capital during the year ended September 30, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company received $450,000 in cash. On December 24, 2018, the Company received the remaining balance of $2,550,000 in the form of newly issued shares of Rgene’s Common Stock, at the price of NT$50 (approximately equivalent to $1.60 per share), for an aggregate number of 1,530,000 shares, which accounted for equity method long-term investment as of December 31, 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has recognized investment loss of $549. On December 31, 2018, the Company determined to fully write off this investment based on the Company’s assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of the operating performance of the investee, adverse changes in market conditions and the regulatory or economic environment, changes in operating structure of Rgene, additional funding requirements, and Rgene’s ability to remain in business. All projects that have been initiated will be managed and supported by the Company and Rgene.



The Company and Rgene signed an amendment to the Co-Dev Agreement on November 10, 2020, pursuant to which both parties agreed to delete AB-1507 HER2/neu Positive Breast Cancer Combination Therapy and AB 1527 Ovary Cancer Combination Therapy and add ABV-1519 EGFR Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Combination Therapy and ABV-1526 Large Intestine / Colon / Rectal Cancer Combination Therapy to the products to be co-developed and commercialized. Other provisions of the Co-Dev Agreement remain in full force and effect.




III. | Clinical Development Service Agreement with Rgene 
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




On June 10, 2022, the Company expanded its co-development partnership with Rgene. BioKey entered into a Clinical Development Service Agreement with Rgene (“Service Agreement”) to guide certain Rgene drug products, RGC-1501 for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), RGC-1502 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and RGC 1503 for the treatment of colorectal cancer patients, through completion of Phase II clinical studies under U.S. FDA IND regulatory requirements (the “Rgene Studies”).



Under the terms of the Service Agreement, BioKey is eligible to receive payments totaling up to $3.0 million over a 3-year period with each payment amount to be determined by certain regulatory milestones obtained during the agreement period. Through a series of transactions over the past 5 years, the Company and Rgene have co-developed the three drug products covered by the Service Agreement, which has resulted in the Company owning 31.62% of Rgene.



As part of the Rgene Studies, the Company agreed to loan $1.0 million to Rgene, for which Rgene has provided the Company with a 5% working capital convertible loan (the “Note”). If the Note is fully converted, the Company will own an additional 6.4% of Rgene. The Company is expected to receive the outstanding loan from the related party by the 2023 Q1, either by cash or conversion of shares of Rgene. The Company may convert the Note at any time into shares of Rgene’s common stock at either (i) a fixed conversion price equal to $1.00 per share or (ii) 20% discount of the stock price of the then most recent offering, whichever is lower; the conversion price is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Note. The Service Agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration date of the last patent and automatically renew for 5 more years unless terminated earlier by either party with six months written notice. Either party may terminate the Service Agreement for cause by providing 30 days written notice.





9







Rgene has further agreed, effective July 1, 2022, to provide the Company with a seat on Rgene’s Board of Directors until the loan is repaid in full. The Company has nominated Dr. Jiang, its Chief Strategy Officer and Director to occupy that seat; Dr. Jiang is also one of the Company’s largest shareholders, owning 12.8% of the Company. For more information about the Service Agreement and Note, please refer to the current reports on Form 8-K filed on June 21, 2022.



BLEX 404, a new drug under clinical development covered by the Service Agreement, is extracted from Maitake mushroom (Grifola frondosa), an edible mushroom. Its immunological effects and the safety have been demonstrated in two Phase I/II clinical studies performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) with breast cancer and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients.



Market Distribution Strategy



We focus primarily on developing botanical drugs, which are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation or treatment of disease in humans. Together with our strategic partners, we plan to market, distribute and sell our drug products internationally once those drug candidates comply with the local authorities regulating drugs and foods. Currently, many countries follow the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (the “ICH”) guidelines that are published by European Medicines to provide guidance on quality and safety of pharmaceutical development and new drug commercialization in Japan, the United States and Europe. All of our drug candidates first go through the United States FDA process for new drug development first and then seek regulatory approval from regulators equivalent to the FDA in the jurisdictions where we plan to distribute those candidates.
Intellectual Property



The new drug candidates are dependent on or are the subject of the following patents and patent applications.

Corporate History and Structure



ABVC was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 6, 2002 and has three wholly-owned Subsidiaries: BriVision, BioLite Holding, Inc. and BioKey, Inc. BriVision was incorporated in July 2015 in the State of Delaware and is in the business of developing pharmaceutical products in North America.



BioLite Holding was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 27, 2016, with 500,000,000 shares authorized, par value $0.0001. Its key Subsidiaries include BioLite BVI, Inc. (“BioLite BVI”) that was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on September 13, 2016 and BioLite Inc. (“BioLite Taiwan”), a Taiwanese corporation that was founded in February 2006. BioLite Taiwan has been in the business of developing new drugs for over twelve years. Certain shareholders of BioLite Taiwan exchanged approximately 73% of equity securities in BioLite Taiwan for the Common Stock in BioLite Holding in accordance with a share purchase/ exchange agreement (the “Share Purchase/ Exchange Agreement”). As a result, BioLite Holding owns via BioLite BVI approximately 73% of BioLite Taiwan. The other shareholders who did not enter this Share Purchase/ Exchange Agreement retain their equity ownership in BioLite Taiwan.



Incorporated in California on November 20, 2000, BioKey has chosen to initially focus on developing generic drugs to ride the opportunity of the booming industry.



Upon closing of the Mergers on February 8, 2019, BioLite and BioKey became two wholly-owned subsidiaries of ABVC.



The following chart   illustrates the corporate structure of ABVC:





Effective March 5, 2022, the Company’s Board for Directors approved amending the Company’s Bylaws to remove Section 2.8, which permitted cumulative voting for directors since cumulative voting is specifically prohibited by our Articles of Incorporation. Since it is not otherwise stated in our Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the election, as provided in the Nevada Revised Statutes.



Competition



The healthcare industry is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change as researchers learn more about diseases and develop new technologies and treatments. Significant competitive factors in our industry include product efficacy and safety; quality and breadth of an organization’s technology; skill of an organization’s employees and its ability to recruit and retain key employees; timing and scope of regulatory approvals; the average selling price of products; the availability of raw materials and qualified manufacturing capacity; manufacturing costs; intellectual property and patent rights and their protection; and our capabilities of securing competent collaborators. Market acceptance of our current products and product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including: (i) potential advantages over existing or alternative therapies or tests, (ii) the actual or perceived safety of similar classes of products, (iii) the effectiveness of sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, and (iv) the scope of any approval provided by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.



Since we are a small biopharmaceutical company compared to other companies that we may compete against, it is our intention to license our products to much larger pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies with the financial, technical and human resources to compete effectively in the markets we address.



We anticipate that our license partners will face intense and increasing competition when and as our new drug candidates enter the markets, as advanced technologies become available and as generic forms of currently branded products become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our products non-competitive or obsolete. There can be no assurance that any of our new drug candidates will be clinically superior or scientifically preferable to products developed or introduced by our competitors.

Government Regulations



Currently, we are focusing on the research and development of six therapeutic candidates in the fields of CNS, oncology/hematology and autoimmune, for which regulatory approval must be received before we can commence marketing. In addition, our cGMP facility is subject to review by the FDA. Regulatory approval processes and FDA regulations for ABVC’s current and any future product candidates are discussed below.
Approval Process for Pharmaceutical Products



FDA Approval Process for Pharmaceutical Products



In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Pharmaceutical product development in the U.S. typically involves the performance of satisfactory nonclinical, also referred to as pre-clinical, laboratory and animal studies under the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulation, the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes, which conform to FDA mandated current good manufacturing requirements, or cGMPs, including a quality system regulating manufacturing, the submission and acceptance of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S., obtaining the approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials, adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought, and the submission to the FDA for review and approval of an NDA. Satisfaction of FDA requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.



Pre-clinical tests generally include laboratory evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as certain animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. Results of these pre-clinical tests, together with chemistry, manufacturing controls and analytical data and the clinical trial protocol, which details the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, along with other requirements must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials can begin. The entire clinical trial and its protocol must be in compliance with what are referred to as good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements. The term, GCP, is used to refer to various FDA laws and regulations, as well as international scientific standards intended to protect the rights, health and safety of patients, define the roles of clinical trial sponsors and assure the integrity of clinical trial data.





13







An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold. Pre-clinical studies generally take several years to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective, allowing clinical testing to begin. In addition to FDA review of an IND, each medical site that desires to participate in a proposed clinical trial must have the protocol reviewed and approved by an independent IRB or Ethics Committee, or EC. The IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, and the selection and safety of human subjects. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GCP requirements. The FDA and/or IRB may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial or that a specific clinical trial site be halted at any time, or impose other sanctions for failure to comply with requirements under the appropriate entity jurisdiction. 



Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.



In Phase I clinical trials, a product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or patients with the medical condition for which the new drug is intended to be used. The main purpose of the trial is to assess a product candidate’s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate the product candidate. Phase I clinical trials generally include less than 50 subjects or patients.



During Phase 2 trials, a product candidate is studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to: (i) further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks, (ii) assess the preliminary or potential efficacy of the product candidate for specific target diseases or medical conditions, and (iii) assess dosage tolerance and determine the optimal dose for Phase III trials.



Phase III trials are generally undertaken to demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population with the goal of evaluating the overall risk-benefit relationship of the product candidate. Phase III trials are generally designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint, the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the candidate product’s clinical efficacy and adequate information for labeling of the approved drug.



The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the FDA’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed within six months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts — for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 



After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks.



REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 



Post-Approval Regulations



Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval is typically limited to specific clinical indications. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any FDA-approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences. Further, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. ABVC cannot be certain that ABVC or its present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with cGMPs regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production activities, failure of the FDA to grant approval for marketing, and withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of marketing approvals.





14







If the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, ABVC must provide certain updated safety and efficacy information. Product changes, as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post-approval changes may necessitate additional FDA review and approval. The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing us to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.

 

Foreign Regulatory Approval



Outside of the U.S., ABVC’s ability to market our product candidates will be contingent also upon its receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities, whether or not FDA approval has been obtained. The foreign regulatory approval process in most industrialized countries generally encompasses risks similar to those ABVC will encounter in the FDA approval process. The requirements governing conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorizations, and the time required to obtain requisite approvals, may vary widely from country to country and differ from those required for FDA approval.



ABVC will be subject to additional regulations in other countries in which we market, sell and import our products, including Canada. ABVC or its distributors must receive all necessary approvals or clearance prior to marketing and/or importing our products in those markets.



Other Regulatory Matters



Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety &Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. In the U.S., sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Health Care Reform Law, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 



The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive recordkeeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.



The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, imprisonment or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.



Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
