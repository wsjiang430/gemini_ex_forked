ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

We are engaged in the development and sale of alcohol and non-alcohol brands that are “Better-for-You” (“BFY”) and “Better-for-the-Planet”. Our brands include “Bellissima” by Christie Brinkley, a premium BFY collection of Prosecco, Sparkling Wines, and Still Wines, all certified vegan and made with organic grapes. Bellissima is strategically positioned with its Zero Sugar Wines. TopPop, our wholly-owned subsidiary, produces low calorie, “ready-to-go” products, ready-to-freeze (“RTF”) products and ready-to-drink (“RTD”) products in sustainable, flexible and stand-up pouch packaging, which includes, “cocktails-to-go” pouches and alcohol ice-pops. United is our 100% owned subsidiary that sells our Bellissima, Bella, Sonja Sangria and other alcohol beverages to state distributors. United holds all applicable state and federal licenses in order to sell these products to state distributors in accordance with the United States three tier distribution platform.

We have expertise in developing, from product inception to wholesale distribution or direct to consumer through the QVC distribution channel, and in branding alcohol beverages for our company and for third parties. We market and place products into national distribution through long-standing industry relationships approximately 45 national or regional alcoholic beverage distributors. We currently market and sell the following product lines: 


· | Bellissima Prosecco – these products comprise a line of all-natural and vegan Prosecco and Sparkling Wines made with organic grapes, including a Zero Sugar, Zero Carb option, a DOC Brut and a Sparkling Rose. The Bellissima line of Prosecco and Sparkling Wines includes two new flavor profiles, a Zero Sugar/Zero Carb Sparkling Rose and a Rose Prosecco;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Bellissima Zero Sugar Still Wines – this line of five still wines was launched in March 2022 and are certified vegan and are made with organic grapes; 
· | Bella Sprizz Aperitifs – these products comprise a line of aperitifs consisting of three different expressions, a classic Italian aperitif, an all-natural elderflower aperitif and a classic Italian bitter; 
· | Sonja Sangria – a celebrity Sangria that we have sold since the May 2021. This product is actively being marketed but does not represent a significant part of our sales; 
· | Ready-to-Freeze and Ready-to-Drink Alcohol and Non-Alcohol Products – these products are currently produced under contract for third-party national and regional brands and for our own product line; and 
· | BiVi Vodka – a celebrity-branded vodka that we have sold since 2018 under the brand “BiVi 100 percent Sicilian Vodka” and which currently does not represent a material portion of our sales. 


As a result of our July 2021 acquisition of 100% of the equity of TopPop, we are now a vertically integrated company that develops, produces and distributes alcoholic brands. TopPop is a product development, contract manufacturing and packaging company that specializes in flexible packaging applications in the food, beverage and health categories. It has the federal and state licenses necessary to manufacture and blend malt, wine and spirits-based products. In June 2020, TopPop opened a 27,000-square-foot FDA-approved manufacturing facility in Marlton, New Jersey with a Safe Quality Food certification. In September 2021, TopPop leased a 64,000 square foot facility for manufacturing in Pennsauken, New Jersey.  In February 2022, TopPop leased an 82,000 square foot warehouse in Pennsauken, NJ, which is used for storage. TopPop has subletted 50% of the floor space in the Pennsauken warehouse in order to reduce rental costs.

We believe TopPop brings to us additional synergies and opportunities for cross-promoting new and existing products to a broader customer base and better positions our company to establish and support our brands and to create sustainable packaging solutions to the consumable goods market. We believe our focus on lifestyle branding and the rising “Better-for-You,” “Better-for-the-Planet” consumer categories has made us a leader in developing celebrity brands worldwide, such as our Bellissima Prosecco by Christie Brinkley. Our mission is to be an industry leader in the brand development, marketing and sales of alcohol beverages and related products by capitalizing on our ability to procure products from around the world and to develop unique and innovative packaging to create brand and product line extensions. We plan to leverage our relationships to add value to our products and to create brand awareness in unbranded niche categories.

For its first product line, TopPop identified the single serve, RTD and RTF as an opportunity for product and packaging innovation. TopPop introduced an alcohol-infused ice pop in June 2020 and began marketing the concept to major alcohol companies. In addition, it developed its own product line which is expected to be sold through e-commerce platforms and wholesaled directly to sports and entertainment venues. TopPop manufactured approximately eight million ice pops from its launch in June 2020 through December 31, 2020, manufactured approximately 42 million ice pops during the year ended December 31, 2021 and manufactured approximately 40 million ice pops during the year ended December 31, 2022. We currently expect to have the capacity to manufacture over 100 million units by the end of 2023. Although we continue to believe that we benefit and will continue to benefit from the synergies and growth opportunities related to the TopPop Acquisition, during 2022 we encountered significant operational difficulties in producing large quantities of product and installing new machinery. These obstacles led to the loss of our two largest customers and an inability to achieve our targeted margins. We expect 2023 revenue to be in line with that in 2022; however this is significantly less than we originally anticipated when we acquired TopPop, and therefore we have impaired certain intangible assets related to the acquisition, along with cancelling certain contingent liabilities. TopPop does not have purchase orders in 2023 from its two largest customers in 2021 and 2022, and the loss of these customers is expected to significantly reduce our 2023 estimated sales that were projected when we acquired them in July 2021. We presently project 2023 sales to be equal to 2022 sales.

Segments

The Company has two reportable segments: the development and sale of alcohol and non-alcohol brands that are BFY and “better-for-the-planet” (Branded Beverages segment) and the packaging of low calorie, “ready to go” products, RTF products and RTD products in sustainable, flexible and stand-up pouch packaging. See Note 15 – Segment Reporting.
Brands and Products

Bellissima Prosecco, Bellissima Sparkling Wines and Bellissima Still Wines

We market and sell a line of all-natural and vegan prosecco, sparkling wines and still wines made with organic grapes. The prosecco and sparkling wines include two zero sugar options, a zero carb glera grape option, and a zero sugar, zero carb rose option. Our line of sparkling wine also includes a DOC Brut and a sparkling rose, as well as a DOC pink prosecco. Our zero sugar and less-than-one-gram of carbs still wine collection currently consists of a cabernet sauvignon, a chardonnay, a pinot grigio, a rose and a merlot. We market and sell these products under the Bellissima brand name pursuant to a license agreement entered into between our Bellissima Spirits LLC (“Bellissima Spirits”) subsidiary, and Christie Brinkley, Inc., an entity owned by supermodel and entrepreneur Christie Brinkley (“CBI”), on November 12, 2015, which agreement was amended on June 30, 2017 and further amended on April 22, 2022 (as amended, the “Bellissima Agreement”). During her career, Christie Brinkley has appeared on over 500 magazine covers worldwide, served as a spokeswoman for CoverGirl, and performed on Broadway, in television and in film.

The Bellissima products are produced at a winery located in Treviso, Italy. Bellissima’s winery partners manage the procurement of all raw materials required to produce a finished product of the Bellissima sparkling wine and still wine collections.

Bella Sprizz Aperitifs

We have also developed, and now market and sell, a line of aperitifs in partnership with Christie Brinkley under the brand name Bella Sprizz. This line of aperitifs consists of three different expressions, a classic Italian aperitif typically used in making a “Spritz,” or as we prefer to say “Sprizz.” The second product in the line is an all-natural elderflower aperitif that may be added as a component to a consumer’s favorite cocktail or simply added to another spirit, such as a glass of our Bellissima Zero Sugar. We also offer “Bella Bitter,” a classic Italian bitter that can be served over ice with a garnish, such as a squeeze of a fresh orange, or added as a component in making a superior Negroni, a popular Italian cocktail.
Sonja Productions LLC

We have signed a brand licensing agreement (the “Sonja Agreement”) with Sonja Productions LLC, a company owned by Sonja Morgan (“Sonja Productions”), pursuant to which we obtained the exclusive right to use certain of Sonja Productions’ intellectual property in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of red sangria using Sonja’s name, image, signature and likeness in connection therewith. Pursuant to the Sonja Agreement, we will pay Sonja Productions a royalty of 10% of the net sales of all products sold during the term of the Sonja Agreement, including direct-to-consumer sales. As of December 31, 2022, sales for this product have been minimal, and we currently anticipate that additional delays in a national launch may be necessary.

Private Label Manufacturing and Distribution 

In addition to developing celebrity brands, we have the abiltiy to develop and supply products for national restaurant chains, consumer good companies, and national retailers with high-quality, private label products through our designated in-market wholesalers. We believe that private labeling presents a significant opportunity for growth of our business. We can provide full-service, turnkey private labeling-enabled expertise in product sourcing, product development, brand development, marketing and distribution.

We previously marketed and sold a line of private-label premium spirits under the Hooters brand, including vodka, gin, rum (dark & light), tequila (silver & gold), American Whiskey and Hooters Heat Cinnamon Whiskey. Currently, we are in the process of developing a Hooters product that will be produced by TopPop, pursuant to an amended agreement.

TopPop is also launching its own brand of RTF products using an e-commerce distribution channel. 

Flexible Packaging

Our recently acquired TopPop subsidiary specializes in flexible packaging for alcohol and non-alcohol products as an alternative to cans and bottles. We believe the trend in beverage, liquid and lotion packaging has been to move away from bottles and cans and toward flexible stand-up pouches. In particular, beverage brands continue to develop packaging with the objective of accentuating the entire experience of the consumer associated with holding, opening, drinking, and enjoying beverages. We believe flexible packaging offers numerous benefits in the marketing, packaging and distribution of alcohol. In addition, we believe flexible, stand-up pouches create design opportunities to have the package stand out and appeal to consumers.

The key advantages of flexible packaging over cans and bottles for alcohol products include the following:


· | Barrier Protection - Barrier material used in specialized alcohol pouches provides an oxygen barrier with a longer shelf life. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Product Differentiation - Disruptive marketers can use standout packaging formats to differentiate themselves from long-established brands in traditional containers. New pouches developed specifically for the alcohol sector can provide greater stability and offer better shelf presence in stores. 
· | Millennial and Gen Z Appeal - Flexible packaging has been shown to appeal to millennials and Gen Z’ers due to the increased portability and reduced weight. 
· | Sustainability - Pouches offer an estimated 80-85% reduction in carbon footprint compared to glass. Pouches also compare favorably compared to cans, as they easily can be flattened and recycled after the liquid is consumed, unlike cans, which must be crushed and recycled in trash cans or recycling bins.
· | Supply Chain Efficiency - Reduced packaging material also has a ripple effect on the supply chain, with less space needed to store and transport the product, which improves total supply chain efficiencies and costs. 


TopPop also has other initiatives in place regarding recycling for its product packages and continues to work with vendors toward increasingly sustainable solutions.

Industry Overview

According to Euromonitor International, a leading provider of global business intelligence, market analysis and consumer insights, in 2019, the “high end” and “super premium” categories experienced larger sales growth than the “premium” and “value” categories. Within the wine category, there has been a shift in consumer behavior towards Sparkling Wine and Rosé. Prosecco and Sparkling Rosé in particular have seen high growth rates.

According to Statista, a leading research firm for a number of consumer goods markets, the U.S. alcoholic beverages market was valued at approximately $283.8 billion in revenue in 2022 and is expected to grow annually by a 5.55% CAGR from 2023-2027.  Worldwide, compared to 2012, the alcoholic beverages market is forecast to grow by approximately 84% by 2025 to over $2.2 trillion in value, up from $1.2 trillion in 2012. Also, according to Statista, “Low and non-alcoholic ready to drink alcoholic beverages are forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 38 percent between 2018 and 2022 in the United States. Wine is second, with a CAGR nearly 18 percent over that time period.” 

We believe that the predicted growth of these beverage markets can be tied to the broader trend in food and beverage of better-for-you products which promote a healthier lifestyle.  According to Statista, an “emerging trend in the industry follows the general trend towards health and wellness in the overall food and beverage industry. As more and more people are trying to limit their intake of alcohol, more companies across the spectrum of the industry have begun offering low and no-alcoholic options, to great success. The boom in hard seltzer fits nicely into this trend as they generally have the calories of a lite beer.” 

According to “Research and Markets,” the flexible packaging market is approximated to be $248.9 billion in 2022, and it is projected to reach $315.5 billion by 2027 at a CAGR of 4.8%. Research and Markets stated that “Pouches are the major packaging type of flexible packaging. Pouches have the largest market share because of its excellent properties, such as low weight, resale ability, vacuum sealing, low package-to-product ratio, and others. The demand for pouches is higher in the food and beverages industry…”.

According to Beverage Daily, new young consumers are looking for ethical brands that focus on causes they care about, which often includes the planet, animals welfare and social inclusivity, among others.

Currently, the celebrity-branded alcoholic beverage industry is a largely consolidated industry, in which the largest companies control a significant portion of industry revenues. This includes existing distillery companies that use their own liquor and parent brands to promote their products. These companies have a significant advantage over smaller industry participants because they already have large bottling facilities and established brands.

Industry market share has also increased slightly during recent years as larger companies acquired smaller firms. For example, Sammy Hagar sold an 80% stake to Gruppo Campari for $80 million, Bethenny Frankel sold her Skinny Girl Cocktail brand to Fortune Brands’ Beam Global for an estimated $100 million in 2011, and George Clooney sold his tequila company to Diageo for approximately $1 billion.

Entrants and products in the celebrity-branded alcoholic beverage industry include, but are not limited to, Casamigos Tequila and George Clooney (2013), Ciroc Vodka and Sean Combs (2007), Skinnygirl Margarita and Bethenny Frankel (2011) and Cabo Wabo Tequila and Sammy Hagar (1996).

Given the trends discussed above, we believe that there is a substantial opportunity in this market due to the rising popularity of celebrity-branded alcoholic beverages.

Sales and Marketing

We intend to utilize the strength of our management team and industry consultants to focus on brands that will consistently meet the needs of customers and consumers around the world. We aim to gain brand loyalty by partnering with well-known celebrities and/or national chains, such as we have with Christie Brinkley and Sonja Morgan, and have in the past with Chase Elliott and Hooters. We also intend to engage in targeted and national advertising and promotional campaigns, host celebrity and other sponsored events, and to offer distribution incentives. We hope to attain national exposure in order to drive both awareness and sales of our products in their markets. In addition, we expect that on and off-premises promotions, led by our sales management team, will pay off in increased awareness and higher sales.

We intend to kick off promotional campaigns with launch parties, supported by on-premises samplings, contests, on and off-premises giveaways, as well as social media campaigns, the launch of additional bottle sizes, and specialty drinks and menus. Product brochures, press kits, signage, banners, public relations, product placement, sponsorships and internet-based marketing will also be utilized to maximize brand exposure and awareness.

Examples of some of our promotional activities in 2022 include:


· | Social media campaigns, POS for stores, in-store tastings, and collaborations with media for Bellissima’s newly launches line of premium Zero Sugar still wines. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | In 2022, Bellissima participated at Vegandale festival in Miami and at Vegandale festival in Chicago. This was an opportunity to bring the Bellissima Prosecco & Wines in front of thousands of vegans and non-vegans in the vegan and vegan-curious target demographic. This event helped increase awareness about the brand and drive product trials and sales. In addition to this, the event converted social media awareness and engagement for the brand, thus increasing the overall reach of the brand during this campaign.
· | For Earth Month, Bellissima partnered with the NGO One Tree Planted for a reforestation campaign, in which Bellissima donated one tree for every bottle of Bellissima sold. This aimed to help the regions affected by wildfires in California. In 2022, 12,000 trees were planted, in addition to the 10,000 trees planted in 2021. We believe this campaign enhanced the positioning of our better-for-you & better-for-the-planet wine and helped engage the sustainable-conscious consumers. 
· | Bellissima and Sonja Sangria participated at Women’s Expo New Jersey, which we believe raised awareness of the brands, increased product trials and drove sales. 
· | Bellissima collaborated with Wine Enthusiast for a promotional campaign for Bellissima’s new line of premium Zero Sugar Still Wines. The campaign included an educational article on the digital version of the magazine and a media component for increased awareness among wine enthusiasts across platforms. 
· | Sonja Sangria was introduced at several shows as part of the Sonja in your city tour. Sonja Sangria was represented at the shows in Texas, New Jersey and New York. 
· | Bellissima partnered with Modern Luxury Weddings. The collaboration included participation at two bridal events in Chicago and features in the wedding-themed magazine. This highlighted the brand to wedding planners, event coordinators, wedding catering companies, event venues and future brides. 
· | Sonja Sangria hosted a bottle signing event with Sonja Morgan at a store in the NY / Long Island area that sells Sonja Sangria. 
· | The Company’s brands were introduced at trade shows in the United States such as NABCA and the Albany and Rochester NYSLSA. 


We also plan to participate in consumer trade shows where wholesalers and retailers are also invited. This will allow our sales team to meet with many of the wholesalers and retailers who are otherwise hard to reach. Advertising and promotion will also be achieved through staff training of on-premise locations; bartenders and wait-staff will be trained to fully understand our products and market them to customers. Incentives will then be offered to motivate sales efforts. 

TopPop has engaged a major marketing agency to promote its RTD and RTF products in flexible packaging to sports and entertainment venues.

Finally, we engage in direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales events, such as sales through QVC and websites.

Production and Suppliers

Bringing a wine brand to market involves several stages, including name choice, bottle selection, label or print design, raw material procurement, bottle-filling, and bottle packaging in various configurations for shipment. Labelling can have a large impact on consumers’ purchasing practices. We conduct market research to validate the consistency of our wine labels with our brand narrative. Packaging also continues to be a key driver of brand perception. For our traditional bottling, we often seek shapes or forms that are unique and will add value to our brand awareness in the marketplace. We are exploring “active lifestyle packaging” alternatives to traditional bottling that provides an opportunity for our customers to enjoy our “Better for You” and “Better for the Planet” wine products in non-traditional settings, including bottles with screw-off caps, aluminum cans, and smaller size bottles and cans that can be taken on-the-go and are ideal for in-store point of purchase sales, and through our TopPop subsidiary, pouches and other non-traditional packaging.

All of our wine products are developed and produced by a premier certified grower of organic grapes that is located in the Veneto region of Italy. This arrangement has allowed us to commence our operations and to build our wine brands without having to incur the considerable overhead costs involved with the purchase or full-time lease of a production facility. Under our arrangement with our winery partner, we are actively involved in the development and production of each product category within each brand. To achieve unique flavor profiles for our brands, including for the development and production our Prosecco, Sparkling Wines and newly-released Still Wines, we collaborate with our wine maker, which has substantial expertise in blending wines with unique profiles. Once the final profile is approved and quality control standards are met, our winery partner produces the liquid in bulk and using unique production practices, bottles our wines for export to the United States and several international markets. This process includes the bulk production of the “juice” and the bottling of the product and packaging into cases configured to our specifications.

Our relationship with our winery partner reduces our internal overhead expenses and allows us to benefit from that company’s increased purchasing power. Our winery provides these services on a purchase order basis, which are subject to the parties’ mutual agreement. This agreement outlines the schedule for placing orders, the responsibility and schedule for delivery of production materials, procedures for establishing the wine bottling date and delivery date. We have an open credit line with our winery partner and we provide payment via wire transfer in Euros. From time to time, we may provide an advance payment for the procurement of materials that we refer to as “dry goods”, such as the caps, corks, bottles, cartons and all other materials required to produce the finished product. If there is an opportunity to secure extra “juice,” we have the ability to purchase it by providing advance payment. We maintain approval rights for all components and finished products throughout the process. 

The ability and willingness of our winery partner to supply and provide services to us pursuant to purchase orders may be affected by competing orders placed by other companies, the demands of those companies or other factors. If our winery partner becomes unable or unwilling to supply and provide services to us, we believe we can obtain comparable supplies and services from alternative suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that alternative suppliers will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that alternative suppliers will allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Given our long-standing relationships with our winery partner, we believe we have the ability to receive certain preferences over its other customers. 

Our TopPop manufacturing and packaging operation purchases the alcohol or non-alcohol content for its products from various bulk alcohol suppliers in the United States. In addition, a number of TopPop’s largest customers purchase and deliver the alcohol or non-alcohol content required to manufacture clients’ products to our licensed TopPop facility, given their bulk purchasing capabilities. TopPop also purchases various other raw materials including, but not limited to cartons, liquid and labels. We generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced significant shortages.

Intellectual Property

We strive to protect the reputation of our brands. We establish, protect and defend our intellectual property in a number of ways, including through employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, domestic and foreign trademark protections, intellectual property licenses and social media and information security policies for employees. We have been granted 11 trademark registrations in the United States, and we have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect any newly-developed brands. 

We also rely on, and carefully protect, proprietary knowledge and expertise, including the sources of certain supplies, formulations, production processes, innovation regarding product development and other trade secrets necessary to maintain and enhance our competitive position.

Bellissima Agreements

We market and sell our Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wine products under a license granted by the Bellissima Agreement. Under the Bellissima Agreement, we were granted the right to use Christie Brinkley’s endorsement, signature and other intellectual property in connection with the sale of the products. We have agreed to guarantee certain of the obligations of Bellissima Spirits under the Bellissima Agreement and to indemnify CBI and Christie Brinkley against third-party claims.

Pursuant to the Bellissima Agreement, Bellissima Spirits is obligated to pay CBI a royalty fee equal to 10% of the monthly gross sales (12.5% for sales in excess of defined Case Break Points) of Bellissima branded products payable monthly. CBI has the right to terminate the endorsement if Bellissima Spirits fails to sell as least 20,000 cases each year. In addition, upon a liquidity event of either Bellissima Spirits or our company, CBI is entitled to 22.5% of, in the case of a liquidity event of Bellissima Spirits, the net proceeds generated from such liquidity event, or in the case of a liquidity event of our company, an amount equal to 22.5% of the appraised value of Bellissima Spirits. For purposes of such agreement, the term “liquidity event” means generally, any of the following:


· | a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Bellissima Spirits or our company; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | a change of control of Bellissima Spirits or our company; 
· | a sale of equity following which the members of Bellissima Spirits or the stockholders of our company, immediately prior to such transaction do not own, immediately following such transaction, a majority of the voting and economic rights in Bellissima Spirits or our company; or 
· | a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving Bellissima Spirits or our company, following which the members of Bellissima Spirits or the stockholders of our company, immediately prior to such transaction do not own, immediately following such transaction, a majority of the voting and economic rights in Bellissima Spirits or our company.


On April 22, 2022, pursuant to an amendment to the Bellissima Agreement, we agreed to grant CBI options to purchase 1,500,000 shares of common stock (the “CB Options”). On August 5, 2022, we issued these options at an exercise price of $0.41, vesting equally over two years on a quarterly basis.

On October 23, 2019, United entered into a Marketing and Order Processing Services Agreement (the “Marketing Agreement”) with QVC, Inc. (“QVC”) pursuant to which United granted to QVC an exclusive worldwide right to promote the Bellissima Spirits products through direct response television programs. The initial license period commenced on October 23, 2019 and expires on December 4, 2021. Unless either party notifies the other party in writing at least 30 days prior to the end of the initial license period or any renewal license period of its intent to terminate the Marketing Agreement, the license continually renews for additional two-year periods. The license was automatically extended to December 4, 2023.The Marketing Agreement provides for United’s payment of “Marketing Feed” (payable no less than monthly) to QVC in amounts agreed to between United and QVC from time to time.

Our Bellissima product line is owned by Bellissima Spirits, of which we, Mr. DeCicco, Ms. Faltings and an unaffiliated third party are members. Pursuant to the Bellissima Spirits Operating Agreement, upon a liquidity event of Bellissima Spirits, each of Mr. DeCicco, Ms. Faltings and the unaffiliated third party are entitled to 15.34%, 15.33% and 15.33%, respectively, of the net proceeds of such liquidity event, with us receiving the balance of such net proceeds. On April 15, 2022, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Bellissima Spirits, which provides that upon (i) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, (ii) a change of control of us, (iii) a sale of equity following which our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction do not own, immediately following such transaction, a majority of the voting and economic rights in us, or (iv) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction involving us, each of Mr. DeCicco, Ms. Faltings and the unaffiliated third party will be entitled to sell their interests in Bellissima Spirits to us in exchange for the value of the equity interest in Bellissima Spirits that they would have received upon the sale of Bellissima Spirits, which value will be determined by an independent third-party appraiser.

Distribution

Private Label

Prior to our acquisition of United in July 2021, we marketed and sold our private label Hooters products pursuant to a marketing and distribution agreement entered into between us and United, effective as of April 1, 2019. Under such agreement, we had been granted the right to market and distribute the Hooters Spirits products line to (a) “Hooters” branded restaurants; (b) liquor distributors; and (c) off-premises, retail establishments (with all sales being made through distributors licensed to conduct business in the state of such sale) in the United States, Europe and Asia for a period of five years. The agreement provided for United to receive a fee of $1.00 per case of product sold to any wholesaler for retailer distribution.

11


United obtained the rights to manufacture, market, distribute and sell certain alcoholic products bearing the Hooters trademarks in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia pursuant to a brand licensing agreement that it had entered into with Hooters on July 23, 2018 (the “Hooters Agreement”). Pursuant to the Hooters Agreement, United was granted a non-exclusive license to use the “Hooters” trademarks to manufacture, market, distribute and sell certain alcoholic products bearing the Hooters trademarks in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia for a period that expired on December 31, 2020. Under the Hooter’s Agreement, United paid Hooters an advance of $30,000, and agreed to pay royalties to Hooters of 6% of net sales (as defined) of all products during the term. In addition, the agreement also provided for United’s payment of a marketing contribution equal to 2% of the prior year’s net sales of the licensed products. If United failed to spend the required marketing contribution in any calendar year, the deficiency would be paid to Hooters. In November of 2021, we amended the contract with Hooters, which, among other items, would allow for TopPop to produce a ready to drink product line and would discontinue the sale of the branded alcohol products.

By law, United can only sell our alcoholic products to licensed United States wholesalers or distributors. Wholesalers and distributors then sell the product to licensed retailers for “on” or “off” premise consumption. An “on” premise retailer is an establishment where the alcohol is consumed, such as a bar or restaurant, and an “off” premise retailer is an establishment where alcohol is sold for consumption elsewhere, such as a liquor store or, in some state, a supermarket. Accordingly, our products are shipped to the United States by United either directly to its distributors or to United’s warehouse. Products that are shipped to United’s warehouse are then shipped via ground freight to wholesalers or distributors to fulfill orders as they are placed.

We have registered trademarks in the United States associated with our BiVi and Bella Sprizz brands or products. In addition, Richard DeCicco, our Chairman of the Board and President, owns the rights to a trademark depicting an image of the Botticelli Venus that is used on certain or our Bellissima and Bella Sprizz products. We use that trademark with the permission of Mr. DeCicco.

Our other brands, such as Bellissima Prosecco and Sparkling Wines or Hooters branded spirits, are either protected under trademarks owned by the licensors or under common law use, and we use them with the licensors’ permission pursuant to the agreements that we or our subsidiaries have entered into with them.

We intend to apply for new trademarks on an ongoing basis as we develop new brands or products. We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, and similar intellectual property as very important to our business.

We enforce and protect our trademark rights against third parties infringing or denigrating our trademarks by opposing registration of infringing trademarks and initiating litigation as necessary.

Competition

The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength, as well as providing consumers with unique brands with special attributes that set our brands apart from the rest. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our competitors include, but are not limited to, Gallo, Mionetto, Gruppo Campari, Constellation Brands, William Grant and Sons and Jim Beam Brands.

12


As TopPop products are relatively new in the marketplace, there is not yet significant competition in the manufacturing and sale of such products to or for the account of third parties. We expect competition to intensify with the expected increase in the popularity of RTD and RTF products in flexible packaging.

Governmental Regulation of the Wine and Spirits Industry

The production and sale of malt, wine and spirits is subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau and state liquor commissions and agencies.

In addition, most states in which our products are sold impose varying excise taxes on the sale of alcoholic beverages. Prompted by growing government budget shortfalls and public reaction against alcohol abuse, government entities often consider legislation that could potentially affect the taxation of alcoholic beverages. Excise tax rates being considered are often substantial. The ultimate effects of such legislation, if passed, cannot be assessed accurately. Any increase in the taxes imposed on our products can be expected to have a potentially adverse impact on overall sales of such products. However, the impact may not be proportionate to that experienced by distributors of other alcoholic beverages and may not be the same in every state.

The agreements we have in place with United and Dan Kay International provide the required licensing conduits that allow us to capture the sales relative to alcoholic beverages in the United States. The United States alcohol beverage business is based upon what is known as a “three-tier system.” The three tiers consist of an import or supplier tier if the product is domestically produced. The second tier is the wholesale tier. The third tier is known as the retail tier, consisting of an on and off premise split. The import/supply tier sells to the wholesale tier that then sells to the retail tier.

We possess the import/supply tier licensing as well as the required licenses in the states in which we sell alcoholic beverages to the wholesale tier. Prior to our recent acquisition of United, we had contracted with United to facilitate the sales of our products using the licensing United has in place. This is a common third party provider relationship in the United States alcohol beverage business.

We contract with Dan-Kay International (an entity controlled by Richard DeCicco) for warehousing services for the alcohol beverage products that come to rest in the United States. Dan-Kay maintains a required New York State warehousing license. This license has a level allowing the third-party warehousing classified as “product of others.”
