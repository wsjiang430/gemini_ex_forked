Raspberry Purchase Agreement and Raspberry Juice Processing Agreement with Ditiantai

New Business Initiative – Submillimeter Wave (Terahertz) Quantized Space Therapy Chamber Project



Since the beginning of 2019, Mr. Xu has led the core research and development team of Kangzi to develop and manufacture a new medical product, the Submillimeter Wave (Terahertz) Quantized Space Therapy Chamber (the “Chamber”). Utilizing submillimeter waves, the Chamber is a medical equipment designed to treat cancer through cold nuclear fusion caused by cosmic ray muons in an enclosed chamber. Specifically, we believe that exposure to an appropriate amount of submillimeter waves could accelerate the generation of a large number of cosmic ray muons inside the human body and that such cosmic ray muons could further facilitate cold nuclear fusion, which could reverse the cancering process through which selenium is converted into nickel inside cells.

The team consists of researchers whom have extensive experience in medicine and physics. The lead scientist of the team, Mr. Xu, had served as the deputy chief engineer of the New Energy Base of the National Defense-Science and Technology Commission in 1995, as the chairman and chief scientist of Shanghai Guangcon New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. from 2011 to 2019, and the director of Shanghai Hengbian New Energy Research Institute from 2003 to 2008. In 2012, Mr. Xu was rewarded the “Harmony-Person of the Year in China” at the “2011 Harmony China Annual Summit” in Beijing and recognized as “Leaping China: One of the Most Influential People of the Year in 2011” by China International Economic and Technical Cooperation Promotion Association, China Elite Culture Promotion Association, and China Outstanding Chinese Merchants Association. In 2013, the Organizing Committee of Boau Forum on Asian SME Development awarded Mr. Xu “2013 China Economic Outstanding Contribution Award.”



Pursuant to the terms of the Share Transfer Agreement entered into by JSEL and Kangzi on January 17, 2019, JSEL has the right to monitor and manage all aspects of operation of Kangzi, including its research and development activities relating to the Chamber. As the development of the Chamber enters its final stage at Kangzi, JSEL started accepting pre-orders for the Chamber in September. Subsequently, on October 15 2019, JSEL entered into a clinical cooperation agreement (the “Clinical Cooperation Agreement”) with Shenzhen Saikun Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (“Saikun”). Pursuant to the Clinical Cooperation Agreement, Saikun agreed to pay JSEL 5.5 million RMB as the total preordering payment. 1.5 million RMB and 1.5 million RMB were delivered to JSEL respectively on September 7 and September 27, 2019. The parties are working on the timing for payment of the remaining 2.5 million RMB due under the Clinical Cooperation Agreement. In exchange, JSEL is obligated to purchase all the components of a Chamber from Kangzi, fully assemble it, and conduct a clinical trial with Saikun, third-party hospital partners, and patients using the Chamber. Specifically, after receiving the full amount of payment from Saikun, JSEL shall transport the Chamber to its preferred location, properly install it, and conduct a clinical trial that lasts at least one month. During the clinical trial, JSEL shall provide training sessions regarding the proper operation of the Chamber to Saikun’s employees. Both Saikun and JSEL are obligated to find third-party hospitals whom will agree to act as partners to co-host the clinical trial and patients whom will be voluntarily willing to undergo treatment provided by the Chamber. While Saikun is responsible for various expenses related to the clinical trial, JSEL is responsible for communicating with patients receiving treatment and other patient-related administrative matters. When JSEL determines that Saikun is capable of properly operating the Chamber and managing activities related to the Chamber, Saikun may request JSEL to move the Chamber to a location designated by Saikun and reinstall it. Furthermore, upon the successful completion of the clinical trial, JSEL shall provide Saikun governmental permits necessary for the operation of the Chamber, and Saikun shall operate the Chamber and provide related services to patients under the supervision of JSEL. In addition, JSEL shall transfer the right of using the Chamber and any beneficiary right affiliated to using the Chamber to Saikun upon receiving the full amount of payment from Saikun. JSEL, nevertheless, owns all the intellectual property rights affiliated with the Chamber. If the two parties decide to terminate the Clinical Cooperation Agreement prior to the expiration of the term, Saikun’s right of using the Chamber during the term is still effective as long as its use of the Chamber does not infringe any of JSEL’s intellectual property rights affiliated with the Chamber. The two parties agreed that the term of the Clinical Cooperation Agreement would not end until Kangzi successfully obtains permits issued by relevant government entities supervising development and sale of medical equipment.



To prepare for the mass production of Chambers, Kangzi is conducting clinical experiments to make further improvements on Chamber and adjusting features of the mass-production mold for Chamber. Kangzi is also in the process of obtaining official governmental permits from relevant government authorities to produce and sell Chambers on a national scale. As its long-term business strategy, Kangzi focuses on researching, developing, and manufacturing high-technology medical equipment while targeting both individual and institutional customers. It plans to massively manufacture Chambers in small and medium sizes, establish operation centers to sell Chambers in various cities across China, and initiate advertising and marketing campaigns on different media platforms. Kangzi will also monetize on services provided to customers who use Chambers and other medical products.



In addition to business activities related to Chamber, the Company will commit to the research, development, manufacturing, and sale of healthcare equipment and various health products containing natural plants, including cosmetics, nutritional supplements, and drugs. In the near future, the Company aims to standardize and internationalize the production and sale of healthcare equipment and health products, while increasing its brand awareness in the healthcare and consumer-product markets.
