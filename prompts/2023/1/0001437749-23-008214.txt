ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
QuickLogic Corporation was founded in 1988 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. Our vision is to transform the way people and hardware products interact with each other and their surroundings. Our mission is to provide innovative silicon and software platforms to successfully enable our customers to develop hardware products that fundamentally change the end-user experience. Specifically, we are a fabless semiconductor company that develops a full stack platform for artificial intelligence or AI, voice and sensor processing. The platform is based on our embedded FPGA ("eFPGA") intellectual property ("IP"), low power, multi-core semiconductor system-on-chips ("SoCs"), discrete FPGAs, and AI software. Our customers can use our eFPGA IP for hardware acceleration and pre-processing in their own custom semiconductor hardware products, our SoCs to run our customer’s software and build their hardware around, and our discrete FPGAs to implement their custom functionality. The Analytics Toolkit from SensiML Corporation ("SensiML"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, provides an end-to-end Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning solution with accurate sensor algorithms using AI technology. The full range of platforms, software tools and eFPGA IP enables the practical and efficient adoption of AI, voice and sensor processing across Consumer/Industrial IoT, Consumer Electronics, Military, Aerospace and Defense markets.
 
Our new products include our ArcticPro™, EOS™, QuickAI™, SensiML Analytics Toolkit, ArcticLink® III, PolarPro®3, PolarPro II, PolarPro, and Eclipse II products. In addition to delivering our own semiconductor solutions, our new products category includes our IP business that licenses our eFPGA technology for use in other semiconductor companies SoCs and provides professional services, consisting of development and integration of eFPGA technology into bespoke semiconductor solutions. SensiML provides an AI software platform for products which include Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscriptions for development, per unit license fees when deployed in production, and proof-of-concept services, all of which are also included in the new products revenue category. Our mature products include primarily FPGA families named pASIC®3 and QuickRAM® as well as programming hardware and design software.
 
Our solutions typically fall into one of four categories: Hardware products consisting of Sensor Processing, Display Smart Connectivity, and eFPGA intellectual property and its associated Tools. Our solutions include a unique combination of our silicon platforms, IP cores, software drivers, and in some cases, firmware and application software. All of our silicon platforms are standard hardware products and must be programmed to be effective in a system. 
 
Through the acquisition of SensiML our core IP also expanded to include the SensiML Analytics Toolkit that enables Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs") to develop AI software for a broad array of resource-constrained time-series sensor endpoint applications. These include a wide range of consumer and industrial sensing applications.
 
We collaborate with multiple partners on reference designs, and in some cases, co-marketing and/or co-selling initiatives. QuickLogic also works with processor manufacturers, sensor manufacturers, and voice recognition, sensor fusion and context awareness algorithm developers, and embedded systems companies in the development of reference designs. Through reference designs that incorporate our solutions, we believe processor manufacturers, sensor manufacturers, and sensor and voice algorithm companies can expand the available market for their respective products. Furthermore, should a solution developed for a processor manufacturer or sensor and/or sensor algorithm company be applicable to a set of common OEMs or Original Design Manufacturers ("ODMs") we can amortize our Research and Development ("R&D") investment over that set of OEMs. There may also be cases when platform providers that intend to use always-on voice recognition will dictate certain performance requirements for the combined software/hardware solution before the platform provider certifies and/or qualifies our product for use by end customers.
 
SensiML collaborates with several microcontroller and sensors manufacturers to integrate the microcontroller and/or sensor manufacturers’ development kits with SensiML’s Analytics Toolkit in order to showcase combined solutions for AI/ML applications. Currently, these collaborations include Infineon Technologies, On Semiconductor Corp., Microchip Technology Inc., Silicon Laboratories, Inc., STMicroelectronics N.V., Arduino, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Raspberry Pi, and Nordic Semiconductor.
 
We have changed our manufacturing strategies to reduce the cost of our silicon solution platforms to enable their use in high volume, mass customization products. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI, QuickAI and ArcticLink III silicon platforms combine mixed signal physical functions and hard-wired logic alongside programmable logic. Our EOS S3, EOS S3AI and ArcticLink III solution platforms are manufactured on an advanced process node where we can benefit from smaller die sizes. We typically implement sophisticated logic blocks and mixed signal functions in hard-wired logic because it is very cost-effective and energy efficient. We use small form factor packages, which are less expensive to manufacture and include smaller pin counts. Reduced pin counts result in lower costs for our customer’s printed circuit board space and routing. Furthermore, our SRAM reprogrammable silicon platforms can be programmed in-system by our customers, and therefore we do not incur programming cost, lowering the overall cost of ownership to our customers. We expect to continue to invest in silicon solution platforms and manufacturing technologies that make us competitive for the variety of markets and applications that programmable logic serves. 
 
Our eFPGA IP are currently developed on 250nm, 130nm, 90nm, 65nm, 40nm, 28nm and 22nm process nodes. The licensable IP is generated by an automated compiler tool, called Australis™, that enables our engineers to create an eFPGA IP for our licensees that they can then integrate into their SoC without significant involvement by QuickLogic. We believe this flow enables a scalable development and support model for QuickLogic. For our eFPGA strategy, we typically work with semiconductor manufacturing partners prior to this IP being licensed to a SoC company.
 
In order to grow our revenue from its current level, we depend upon increased revenue from our new products including existing new product platforms and platforms currently in development. We expect our business growth to be driven mainly by our silicon solutions, eFPGA IP and SensiML AI Software. Therefore, our revenue growth needs to be strong enough to enable us to sustain profitability while we continue to invest in the development, sales and marketing of our new solution platforms, IP and software.

Supply Chain Disruptions
 
Global, supply chain constraints have not had a material impact on our business. While we have experienced some volatilities with input material costs and supplier costs in accordance with domestic and global economic conditions, none of these have had a material impact to our business during our Fiscal 2022 year.  We do not expect material increases in costs over the next twelve months. However, we expect to be subject to continued, broader-based inflationary, labor, and supplier costs increases in alignment with domestic and global economic conditions. We expect any increases in costs to be dilutive to our gross profit; and we may be limited in our ability to offset any increased costs with price increases to customers. This may have a negative impact to our results from operations and cash flows.
2023 Cybersecurity Incident
 
On January 20, 2023, the Company detected a ransomware infection affecting a limited number of IT systems, including systems that contained personal information of our employees.  Upon detection of the incident, the Company promptly began an assessment of all Company IT systems, notified law enforcement, and engaged legal counsel and other incident response professionals. The Company continued its business operations during this incident and successfully restored all of its critical operational data. The Company has also taken steps to further secure its IT systems. Based on the ongoing investigation and information currently known at this time, the Company believes the incident has not had nor will have a material impact on its business, operations, ability to serve its customers,  or financial results. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 
Impact of COVID-19 and Global Economic Environment on our Business
 
The COVID-19 pandemic, increased financial market volatility, inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, recessionary concerns and geopolitical tension continue to impact business globally and may impact our operations by causing disruption to our labor markets and supply chains. We continue to monitor the global impacts of COVID-19 and take steps to mitigate the potential risks to us posed by its spread and related circumstances and impacts. These efforts will continue as requirements change, new risks are identified and infections impact us. The spread and resurgence of COVID-19 from new variants in countries where we operate may make our ability to mitigate the impacts of the spread of the virus on our productivity more challenging.
 
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted the global economy and led to various economic sanctions being imposed by the U.S., United Kingdom, European Union and other countries against Russia. While the impacts of the conflict have not been material on the Company's results of operations, as we do not have operations or material customers or suppliers in either country, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this ongoing conflict. Changing U.S. Government export regulations, particularly relating to advanced semiconductors may limit the ability to provide customers with certain goods and services in China.
 
See the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this report for further information about related risks and uncertainties.

Industry Background
 
Internet-of-Things ("IoT") products are a strong growth market for semiconductor products, programmable logic, and AI/ML software, and the needs of this market bring a unique set of requirements. Three important trends in this market are (i) proliferation of hardware products at the edge of the network connected via a wireless network, (ii) an increasing adoption of sensors, and (iii) desire to increase processing efficiency as a means to lower power consumption and increase battery life. The trends to add more sensors to these connected hardware products is driven from the desire to enable more intelligence in these hardware products so that they can operate without continuously sending raw data back to a cloud-based infrastructure; sending metadata in lieu of raw data is more efficient for cost and power consumption and is generally viewed as more secure. Creating metadata from raw data requires more processing capability in the sensor-enabled hardware as well as sophisticated software.
 
Historically, processing capability was built using a homogenous architecture, meaning, one that consisted of the use of only one type of technology. This could be one or more instances of a single processor type, or only programmable logic. More recently, there is a general trend in the semiconductor market that enhanced processing capability can come from the adoption of more heterogeneous architectures. Examples of this trend are the inclusion of one or more general purpose processor cores (e.g. Arm or RISC-V) in conjunction with programmable logic. This type of architecture enables the end user to partition their application workloads across the heterogeneous cores so that the most appropriate core is used for a given workload, often concurrently. Generally, this is viewed as the most optimal way to design systems that need to optimize for performance or battery life.
 
Another important trend is shrinking product life cycles. This drives a need for faster and lower risk product development. There is intense pressure on the bill of materials ("BOM") cost of these hardware products, including per unit component costs and non-recurring development costs. As more people experience the advantages of a mobile lifestyle at home, they demand the same advantages in their professional lives. We believe that the trend toward mobile, battery-powered products that provide more intelligent insights from onboard sensors, small form factor and maximize battery life will be prominent in the computing, industrial, medical and military markets. 
 
    5 

  

We believe these industry trends are shifting the demand among different classes of core silicon. The following are the four main classes of non-memory core silicon:
 

• | Microcontrollers ("MCUs") are typically small, low-power hardware products on a single integrated circuit that contain a processor core, memory and a number of peripherals. They are designed to be programmed with software for embedded applications; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Application Specific Standard Products ("ASSPs") other than processors, are fixed function hardware products designed to address a relatively narrow set of applications. These hardware products typically integrate a number of common peripherals or functions and the functionality of these hardware products is fixed prior to wafer fabrication;
• | Programmable Logic Devices ("PLDs") are general-purpose hardware products, which can be used by a variety of electronic systems manufacturers and are customized after purchase for a specific application. FPGAs are a subset of PLDs and are typically used to implement complex system functions; and 
• | Application Specific Integrated Circuits ("ASICs") are custom hardware products designed and fabricated to meet the needs of one specific application for one end-customer. Structured ASICs, a sub-category of ASICs, provide a limited amount of custom content to broaden the applicability of a device for additional applications. 

 
ASSPs are offered broadly to the market, making it challenging for a system designer to create differentiated products from these hardware products alone. In many situations, the available ASSPs may not directly implement the desired function and the system designer is required to use a combination of ASSPs to achieve the desired result at the expense of increased cost, product size and power consumption. As standards evolve or new standards are developed, ASSPs may not be available to implement desired functions.
 
System designers can customize their products using programmable logic ASICs or MCUs. The competitive dynamic between these classes of core silicon are well understood. High development risks, development costs and opportunity costs are incurred when using ASICs to produce custom hardware products with very low unit production cost. Suppliers of programmable logic hardware products, which have lower development and market risks and development costs relative to ASICs, have aggressively reduced the unit cost of their products over time, making programmable logic hardware products the solution of choice for custom products unless the volume is very high. These cost reduction efforts have significantly increased the volume required to justify the total cost of an ASIC.
 
IoT hardware products (both Consumer and Industrial) incorporate complex, rapidly changing technology, require rapid product proliferation, and have varying product life and development cycles. Therefore, most IoT designers design their products from a base platform, or reference design, provided to them by the vendor of the processor they have selected for their design. To differentiate their products from their competition, OEMs and ODMs may require some level of customization at either the hardware or software level. Designers have only a few viable options to modify the base platform for their needs. Since IoT system designers often require very low power consumption to maximize battery life in their applications, the high-power consumption of conventional FPGAs is incompatible with their design goals. This effectively limits the average battery-powered system designer to ASSPs, small PLDs, mobile-oriented FPGAs, and MCUs to create a virtual level playing field among battery-powered system designers and makes product proliferation and differentiation extremely hard to achieve. ASICs with their long development cycles, long lead times and high non-recurring development costs are only used in very high-volume mainstream consumer products.
 
The traditional defense and industrial markets are well served by existing core silicon or custom ASIC development. Much of this market's uses are generally not as price, power and size sensitive. When there is a strong need for a custom solution in high volume applications, designers turn to an ASIC and, in low to medium volume applications, they use FPGAs. QuickLogic FPGAs have a loyal following in certain segments of these markets, particularly when instant-on, energy efficiency, high reliability or intellectual property security is important. QuickLogic has also entered into eFPGA-related agreements with customers in the defense market and expects to continue to do so in the future. Historically, the defense market has followed QuickLogic's mature products revenue trend, but recent advancements in QuickLogic's Australis IP generator tool and participation in the DARPA Toolbox, have enabled renewed interest from customers in this area. Consequently, QuickLogic expects these trends to result in higher growth.
 
Markets and Product Technology
 
We market our solutions primarily to IoT device OEMs and ODMs, defense contractors, and U.S. Government entities. We have complete solutions incorporating our silicon platforms, IPs, software drivers, SensiML Analytics Toolkit and our system architecture expertise. A solution can be based on our programmable technology, which enables customized designs, low power, flexibility, rapid time-to-market, longer time-in-market and lower total cost of ownership. We are capable of providing complete solutions because of our investment in developing the low power IP and software required to implement specific functions, along with sensor software algorithms optimized for our architecture. In some cases, we develop the IPs and either software or firmware ourselves and, in other cases, we utilize third parties to develop the mixed signal physical layers, logic and/or software.
 
We market our solutions to OEMs and ODMs offering differentiated IoT products, to processor vendors wishing to expand their served available market, and to sensor manufacturers and sensor processing software companies wishing to expand their ecosystems. Our target markets include Consumer/Industrial IoT, Consumer Electronics, Military, Aerospace and Defense. Our solutions typically fall into one of four categories: Sensor Processing, eFPGA IP and its associated Tools, Display or Smart Connectivity.
 
By using our silicon platforms, our IPs, our software, and our in-depth architecture knowledge, we can deliver energy efficient custom solutions that blend the benefits of traditional ASSPs with the flexibility, product proliferation, differentiation and low total cost of ownership advantages of programmable logic.
 
Our product technology consists of five major elements:
 
First, our programmable logic allows us to hardware customize our platforms. We have two distinct types of programmable logic. We have an SRAM-reprogrammable logic architecture that utilizes a standard CMOS-logic process to meet the specific needs of the sensor and I/O subsystems of IoT hardware products: very low standby power, low dynamic power, and in-system reprogrammable technology. Our SRAM-reprogrammable logic is the basis of our eFPGA IP License initiative, and is the logic used in our EOS S3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS S3AI products.
 
    6 

  

We also have our ViaLink programmable logic that uses proprietary and patented technology to meet the specific smart connectivity needs when the characteristics of non-volatility and instant-on, very low standby power, low dynamic power, small form factor, single chip solutions that power cycle easily and quickly are required. Hardware customization gives our hardware products the ability to execute key actions faster than software implementations, and at lower power.
 
Second, our ArcticLink and EOS S3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS S3AI platforms combine mixed signal physical functions, hard-wired logic and programmable logic on one device. Mixed signal capability supports the trend toward serial connectivity in IoT applications, where designers benefit from lower pin counts, simplified printed circuit board, or PCB, layouts, simplified PCB interconnect and reduced signal noise. Adding hard-wired IP enables us to deliver more logic at lower cost and lower power while the programmable logic allows us to provide solutions that can be rapidly customized to differentiate products, add features and reduce system development costs. This combination of mixed signal, hard-wired logic and programmable logic enables us to deliver low cost, small form factor solutions that can be customized for particular customer or market requirements while lowering the total cost of ownership.
 
Third, we develop and integrate innovative IP cores, intelligent data processing IP cores, or standard interfaces used in IoT products. In addition to standards-based IP, we also offer proprietary IP such as:
 

• | Sensor Processing IPs such as Flexible Fusion Engine, or FFE, Sensor Manager, or Communications Manager; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Hardware Acceleration / Processor Offloading IPs such as various digital filter and matrix multiplication functions.

 
Fourth, we develop and optimize a software framework for use in conjunction with our sensor processing silicon platforms.
 
Fifth, through SensiML, we develop and optimize an end-to-end software suite that provides developers a practical means for developing IoT sensor algorithms using AI. Each component of the software suite handles specific steps to progress from initial raw sensor data collection using prototype hardware to optimized firmware code generation, validation and testing, and post-ship algorithm updates and continuous learning enhancements. SensiML Data Capture Lab is a full-featured client tool that enables rapid, efficient, and collaborative multi-user data collection, cleansing, labeling, and metadata annotation of custom application datasets. SensiML Analytics Studio is a cloud service component that uses labeled datasets to deliver device-optimized firmware for a chosen endpoint product. SensiML Test App is used to quickly and efficiently validate final device firmware and test for the proper behavior, accuracy, and performance of the algorithm empirically on actual endpoint hardware. Lastly, the SensiML Application Programmer’s Interface ("API") is a simplified interface to extend the SensiML algorithms and manage advanced features like edge model tuning and continuous learning updates to the cloud.
 
Marketing, Sales and Customers
 
We monetize our technology through hardware product sales, and eFPGA IP licenses, with any necessary corresponding work delivered via professional engineering services, and SensiML Analytics Toolkit subscriptions and per unit royalties. We specialize in enhancing the user experience in leading edge IoT hardware products. For our customers, we enable hardware and sensor algorithmic differentiation quickly, cost-effectively and at low power. For our partners, we expand their reach into new segments and new use cases thereby expanding the served available market for their existing hardware products.
 
Our vision is to transform the way people and hardware products interact with each other and their surroundings. Our mission is to provide innovative platforms to successfully enable our customers to develop products that fundamentally change the end-user experience. Specifically, we develop low power SoCs, FPGAs, embedded FPGA intellectual property and the SensiML Analytics Toolkit for AI Software. QuickLogic’s products enable Consumer/Industrial IoT, Consumer Electronics, Military, and Aerospace and Defense customers. to deliver highly differentiated products with longer battery life.
 
Our multi-core sensor processing products such as ArcticLink 3 S1, ArcticLink 3 S2, EOS 3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS S3AI accomplish this result with general purpose and targeted cores, which provide an extremely power-efficient approach for real-time multi-modal (vision, motion, voice, location, biometric and environmental) sensor processing independently of the cloud. Our embedded FPGA technology gives SoC developers targeting IoT endpoint applications the flexibility to make design changes post-production while keeping power consumption low. Our SensiML Analytics Toolkit is cutting-edge software that enables ultra-low power IoT endpoints that implement AI to transform raw sensor data into meaningful insight at the device itself. The Toolkit also provides an end-to-end development platform spanning data collection, labeling, algorithm and firmware auto generation, and testing. 
 
Market leading companies need to deliver new products quickly and cost-effectively. We believe our programmable technology allows us to deliver customizable solutions with low power consumption and high IP security, while meeting system performance and BOM cost requirements. We believe our solutions allow OEMs and ODMs to rapidly bring new and differentiated products to market quickly and cost-effectively. Our solutions enable energy and cost-efficient solutions on design platforms from which a range of products can be introduced.
 
We recognize that our markets require a range of solutions, and we intend to work with market leading companies to combine silicon solution platforms, packaging technology, sensor software algorithms, software drivers and firmware, to meet the product proliferation, high bandwidth, time-to-market, time-in-market and form factor requirements of IoT device manufacturers. We intend to continue to define and implement compelling solutions for our target customers and partners.
 
Our business model is targeted on ensuring our products are easy-to-use for the broad electronics market, particularly ones that are focused on enabling their products with AI solutions. This go-to-market strategy focuses on a broader sales and marketing approach. The IoT market for AI solutions is made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of individual customers. We have identified reference designs, evaluation systems and evaluation software kits that we can enable our channel sales partners to sell to these customers. We believe our solutions are resonating with our target customers who value the differentiated user experience, lower power consumption, platform design capability, rapid time-to-market, longer time-in-market and low total cost of ownership available through the use of our solutions.
 
    7 

  

We sell our products through a network of sales managers in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition to our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California, we have international sales operations in China, Japan, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Our sales personnel and independent sales representatives are responsible for sales and application support for a given region, focusing on major strategic accounts, and managing our channel sales partners such as distributors.
 
Customers typically order our products through our distributors. Currently, we have seven distributors in North America and a network of twenty-three distributors and sales representative throughout Europe and Asia to support our international business. eFPGA IP customers and SensiML SaaS subscribers typically enter into licensing agreements directly with QuickLogic and SensiML, respectively.
 
We also have a military, industrial and IoT product customer base that purchases our mature silicon products. We expect to continue to offer silicon hardware products to these customers, as well as new eFPGA IP for when these customers choose to implement their own silicon platform solution.
 
Three customers represented approximately 20%, 16% and 12% of our total revenue for the year ended January 1, 2023. Three customers represented 16%, 14%, and 10% of our total revenue for the year ended January 2, 2022. In addition, a significant portion of our revenue comes from sales to customers located outside of the United States. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
 
Backlog
 
We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results. The majority of our quarterly shipments are typically booked during the quarter. Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders issued by OEM customers and distributors.
Competition
 
A number of companies offer products that compete with one or more of our semiconductor products and solutions. Our semiconductor competitors include: (i) suppliers of ASSPs such as Synaptics; (ii) suppliers of application processors; (iii) suppliers of ASICs; (iv) suppliers of low density FPGAs such as Lattice Semiconductor Corp. and Microsemi Corp. (a subsidiary of Microchip Technology Inc.); and (v) suppliers of low power microcontrollers such as STMicroelectronics N.V. and NXP Semiconductors N.V. Our existing competitors for conventional FPGAs include suppliers of low power complex programmable logic devices ("CPLD") and FPGAs such as Lattice Semiconductor Corp., Xilinx Inc. (a subsidiary of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.), Intel Corp., and Microsemi Corp.
 
ASSPs offer proven functionality which reduces development time, risk and cost, but it is difficult to offer a differentiated product using standard hardware products, and ASSPs that meet the system design objectives are not always available. Conventional programmable logic may be used to create custom functions that provide product differentiation or make up for deficiencies in available ASSPs. PLDs require more designer input since the designer has to develop and integrate the IP and may have to develop the software to drive the IP. PLDs are more expensive and consume more power than ASSPs or ASICs, but they offer fast time-to-market and are typically reprogrammable. OEMs have adopted mobile-oriented FPGAs in the IoT product market but offer very little in terms of hard logic blocks that may decrease power consumption or selling price to the OEM. ASICs have a large development cost and risk and a long time to market. As a result, ASICs are generally only used for single designs with very high volumes. MCUs offer extensive software flexibility, but often do not offer sensor software algorithms, the lowest power, nor any hardware flexibility. Our solutions enable custom functions and system designs with fast time-to-market and longer time-in-market since they are customized by us using our solution platforms that contain programmable logic. In addition, because they are complete solutions, they reduce the system development cost and risk.  Since the AI software market is nascent, particularly for the edge and endpoint applications, the SensiML competitors tend to be venture-backed startups such as Edge Impulse.  Competitors for our eFPGA IP license product include a few startup companies.
 
Research and Development
 
We are focused on developing our solutions and platforms. Our solutions combine our silicon platforms with our IP, software drivers, and other system software, and may include SensiML software for AI applications. Our future success will depend largely on our ability to rapidly develop, enhance and introduce our platform solutions that meet emerging industry standards and satisfy changing customer requirements. We have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in R&D. Our R&D expenses were $5.0 million, or 31% of revenue, $6.9 million, or 55% of revenue, and $7.5 million, or 87% of revenue for the years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. Research and development expenses for the year ended January 1, 2023 reflect reductions due to the allocation of research and development expenses to cost of revenues in support of eFPGA IP revenue.
 
As of January 1, 2023, our research and development staff consists of eighteen employees located in California, Oregon and Taiwan.
 
•  Our system software group creates the drivers and other system code required to connect our silicon hardware products to Application Processors, drivers and microcode to support our sensor hubs.

Manufacturing
 
We have close relationships with third-party manufacturers for our customer commercial products for wafer fabrication, package assembly, and testing requirements to help us ensure stability in the supply of our products and to allow us to focus our internal efforts on product and solution design and sales.
 
In connection with commercial customers, we outsource commercial products wafer manufacturing, primarily to GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited ("TSMC"). We outsource our commercial product packaging primarily to Amkor Technology, Inc. Integra Specialty Products, JCET Group Co. Ltd., and Golden Altos Corp. GlobalFoundries manufactures our EOS S3, EOS S3 LV, and EOS S3AI Sensor Platform in a 40 nm CMOS process, and PolarPro 3E, ArcticLink III VX and BX, and ArcticLink 3 S2 Sensor Hub, in a 65 nm CMOS process. TSMC manufactures our pASIC 3, QuickRAM and certain QuickPCI products, using a 0.35 micron complementary metal oxide semiconductor, ("CMOS"), process. TSMC also manufactures our Eclipse products on 0.25 micron CMOS process, and other mature products using a 65nm CMOS process on twelve-inch wafers. We purchase products from GlobalFoundries, and TSMC on a purchase order basis.
 
Outsourcing of commercial wafer manufacturing enables us to take advantage of the high volume economies of scale offered by these suppliers. We may establish additional commercial foundry relationships as such arrangements become economically useful or technically necessary.
 
In connection with U.S. Government end-user customers, we are required to procure wafer fabrication, package assembly, and testing from sources that maintain Defense Microelectronics Activity accreditation from the U.S. Department of Defense and maintain certain intellectual property security standards. We outsource wafer manufacturing, package packaging and testing services to certified U.S.-owned and continental U.S.-based suppliers.
 
Employees and Human Capital
 
As of January 1, 2023, we had forty-five employees worldwide of which forty employees are located in the United States. We believe our future success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe our employee relations are favorable. We recognize that in order to drive innovation and operational excellence, we must attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified talent. The well-being of employees is a key priority and includes a dynamic and welcoming workplace that promotes inclusive diversity, fosters collaboration and encourages employees to bring their best ideas to work every day, and promotes work-life balance. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that it is important to maintain a large patent portfolio to protect our innovations.
