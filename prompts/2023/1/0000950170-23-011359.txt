 Business Overview
 We are a health technology company focused on developing and commercializing non-invasive bioelectronic medicine. Our platform-based technology activates the body’s own healing mechanisms and can be programmed to treat various disease conditions. Our products provide a natural alternative to the standard synthetic chemical methods used by the pharmaceutical industry.
Bioelectronic medicine treats disease and conditions by modulating the electrical signals carried along various nerve pathways. The field grew out of the neuromodulation industry and relied, historically, on implantable devices (e.g., pacemakers, spinal implants, deep brain stimulators). IDTechEx has identified several fast-growing areas in the bioelectronic medicine field, including peripheral nerve stimulation, which it has indicated is forecasted to grow at a 35% CAGR from 2019 through 2029.
First Commercial Product
 ClearUP® Sinus Relief, our first commercial product, has received multiple innovation awards and high customer ratings across multiple sales platforms. It is based on a non-invasive peripheral nerve stimulation platform that combines proprietary algorithms, programmable stimulation parameters, and a patented monopolar delivery. ClearUP has U.S. FDA approval for the treatment of sinus pain and congestion, and is the first FDA-approved bioelectronic treatment of such indications. Additionally, ClearUP has E.U. CE Mark approval for the treatment of sinus pain, pressure and congestion, which provides us commercial access in the U.S., European Union Member states and certain other countries. It is currently available to consumers in the United States without prescription with expanded end-user labeling including sinus pressure which occurs with sinus pain.
The patented handled device uses ultra-low current electrical waves to relieve sinus pain and congestion symptoms that are prevalent in nasal allergies, sinus infections, chronic sinusitis, cold and flu and other disease conditions. The global treatment markets for each of these disease areas are in the billions, currently dominated by pharmaceuticals, and are projected to grow. According to the Mintel Group Ltd.’s 2020 report, the U.S. market size for cough, cold, flu and allergy in 2022 was expected to be approximately $11.1 billion. We also conducted a market research study (via an online survey) of 600 individuals with ongoing sinus conditions and noted 90% of the participants reported interest in treatments that reduce the use of medications.
 We conducted two published clinical studies with leading research institutions. The first clinical study was a randomized controlled double-blind trial conducted by the Stanford University Sinus Center consisting of 71 subjects suffering from sinus pain and congestion, each of whom used either ClearUP or a sham device. The second clinical study was a 30-person study on the use of ClearUP over a period of four weeks conducted by the Allergy and Asthma Associates of Santa Clara Valley Research Center. These studies have substantially demonstrated that ClearUP is highly effective at treating sinus pain from allergic rhinitis and moderate to severe congestion with no sustantive side effects.
Potential for Platform Technology Expansion
 We intend to leverage our platform-based technology and our deep experience with non-invasive bioelectronic medicine to develop or acquire a suite of FDA-approved commercial products for the treatment of various disease conditions.

Our non-invasive bioelectronic platform-based technology enables effective therapeutic solutions with high safety profile and broad application. We are currently conducting a sham-controlled clinical trial in concert with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, designed to reduce pain resulting from functional endoscopic sinus surgery. If successful, a product based on this research would require new regulatory clearances for a novel indication. Additionally, we have completed a market and technology assessment of a potential migraine indication and are developing a clinical protocol related thereto. We have also developed a novel non-invasive approach to targeted vagus nerve stimulation and have conducted proof of principle experiments demonstrating effects on the autonomic nervous system, and have initiated a clinical research program with the Feinstein Institute to further characterize the autonomic effects of the device intervention.
 Given our deep expertise and relationships in the field of bioelectronic medicine, we are continuously monitoring and evaluating options to add complementary product lines into our product portfolio.
 Market Opportunity
 In December 2021, Precedence Research noted that the burden of various chronic diseases and infections is growing and so have people’s healthcare expenditures. Consumers are increasing spending on their healthcare. The shift to an increased focus on improving lifestyle, growing geriatric population, rising disposable income, rising penetration of healthcare insurance, and improved access to healthcare facilities are major factors that drive growth of the medical electronics market. In 2018, the per capita healthcare expenditure in the U.S. was over $10,500. This number is expected to increase.
 Grand View Research projects that the non-invasive electroceutical devices segment will witness the highest growth through 2030. This is due to technological advancements and rising investments in research and development by companies for innovative product development. Moreover, increasing healthcare awareness and popularity of electroceuticals in developing countries such as India, China, South Africa, and Argentina are expected to propel market growth. Factors such as industrialization, climate change, and changing lifestyles are increasing the prevalence of allergic rhinitis, making this a large and growing segment.
 The FDA initially provided clearance to our ClearUP product under a 510(k) as an allergy treatment in January 2019. As a treatment for allergy-related sinus pain, we believe that the available market for ClearUP is approximately 45 million U.S. adults.
 The FDA granted ClearUP a subsequent De Novo clearance in March 2021, which expanded ClearUP’s label, enabling marketing of ClearUP for allergies, sinusitis, cold, flu, and any inflammatory condition involving congestion. With this De Novo clearance, we believe that the available market for ClearUP expands to over 200 million U.S. adults. Based upon our market research (conducted by a national sampling company in 2019, which electronically surveyed 600 individuals reporting ongoing sinus conditions) indicating that 27% of consumers are willing to pay more than $150.00 for ClearUP, and assuming an available market of 200 million U.S. adults, we estimate an available U.S. market of approximately $8 billion. Our market research indicates that, among our target consumers, 74% would expect to purchase ClearUp on Amazon and 65% from the manufacturer’s website.
 According to Mintel Group Ltd., over-the-counter allergy, cough, cold and flu treatments were projected to be an $11.1 billion market in 2022 in the U.S. alone. According to our research, among recurring sufferers (those who reported having an ongoing chronic sinus condition), 90% are interested in treatments that reduce use of medications, 66% are concerned about the side effects of pharmaceutical choices, and over 43% are concerned about addiction. We commissioned this research, and it was conducted by a national sampling company, which electronically surveyed 600 individuals reporting ongoing sinus conditions. Only subjects who reported having an ongoing chronic sinus condition were eligible to participate in the study.


In clinical research studies pertaining to ClearUP:
 •82% of participants indicated that they prefer it to their current treatments;(1) and
 •77% of participants indicated that they would recommend ClearUP.(2)
 (1)Data from a 71-person randomized controlled study conducted by a third-party academic research center.
 (2)Data from a 30-person open label trial conducted by a third-party clinical research organization.
 Additionally, we have received a CE Mark for international marketing. The CE Mark for ClearUP covers an equally broad set of conditions related to sinonasal inflammation with the symptoms pain, pressure and congestion. The CE Mark allows sales in European Union Member states and certain other countries that recognize the CE Mark for regulatory governance. We believe that there are international opportunities for the sale of ClearUP.
 Customers
 We sell our products direct-to-consumer through our own website and major online stores, including Amazon and Walmart, and also sell to major U.S. online retailers, such as BestBuy and FSAStore.

 Sales Channels
 ClearUP is sold directly to consumers through our own website, Amazon, and Walmart. We also sell to major online retailers, such as BestBuy and FSAStore.
 Expansion of our ClearUP sales channels has been gradual and measured to maintain pricing integrity, cultivate consumer acceptance and establish strong channel relationships. With this foundation in place, we believe we are poised to accelerate sales through the expansion of our advertising and marketing efforts.
 Current sales represent a very small percentile of the available market. We project that there is a significant growth opportunity for ClearUP with expanded advertising and product variants to reach new customers and medical professionals.


Marketing and Advertising Strategies
 We utilize omnichannel marketing to raise consumer awareness of ClearUP and convert consumers to purchasers. We participate in press and media to raise general awareness of both ClearUP and the bioelectronic medicine more generally. Since our IPO in November 2021, we have seen a steady increase in direct-to-consumer sales volume as we continue to expand and optimize marketing and advertising tactics.
Core Technology
 Our technology provides a natural alternative to the standard synthetic chemical methods dominated by the pharmaceutical industry. Our market research study indicates consumers are interested in non-pharmaceutical treatment alternatives. We combine proprietary algorithms, programmable stimulation parameters, and a patented monopolar delivery mechanism to modulate the nerve signals. We are researching the clinical utility of this stimulation approach for other clinical conditions. This platform has the potential to accelerate new product development by: (i) extending the existing device platform to other clinical areas, thereby reducing research and development time, and (ii) continuing to benefit from low-risk non-invasive device designations and regulatory pathways by the FDA, which typically result in shorter time to approval when compared with invasive devices or new drugs. Although it is our intention to bring new products to market, medical device development is inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that our research and development efforts will lead to approved products for other clinical indications.
 Key elements of our platform include:
 •a proprietary algorithmic means of detecting areas of dense nerve innervation and blood vessels, which help guide a user to the optimal treatment locations;
 •a proprietary algorithmic means of adapting treatment currents and detection to the unique physiological attributes of the technology’s user at the time of use;
 •a proprietary algorithmic means of dynamically adjusting treatment levels to maintain both efficacy and comfort;
 •programmability of the stimulation protocols via firmware to deliver varied stimulation protocols for different physical and disease targets, providing accelerated opportunities for new product applications; and
 •a unique monopolar design that enables ultra-low currents to pass through skin and tissue while maintaining nearly imperceptible current levels.
 This combination creates a platform for non-invasively influencing peripheral activity with an ultra-low current level.
 Numerous inflammatory conditions are associated with trigeminal and peripheral nerve activity of the face, including:
 •chronic quality-of-life conditions such as migraines (39 million U.S.), temporomandibular joint disorder (31 million U.S.), and tinnitus (50 million U.S.);
 •severe, life-altering conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia (150,000 U.S., severe condition); and
 •acute conditions such as ear infections (50% of children) and pain and swelling from facial and sinus surgeries (600,000 functional endoscopic surgeries annually, U.S.).
 Each of these applications would involve regulation of pain and inflammation-related mediators like those seen in sinus and nasal inflammation.


Competitive Landscape
 Pharmaceutical Treatments
 Sinus pain, pressure and congestion can be caused by allergic rhinitis (allergies), rhinosinusitis, sinus infections, cold and flu and are most often treated with over-the-counter products targeted symptomatically.
 •Sinus pain/pressure is usually managed with analgesic medications (e.g., ibuprofen/Advil, acetaminophen/Tylenol, naproxen sodium/Aleve). Analgesic medications provide short periods of relief and are often associated with side effects including stomach pain, bleeding, ulcers, constipation, diarrhea, gas, bloating, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, nervousness, and rash. 
 •Congestion is treated with a variety of approaches:
 oAntihistamine medications are often a first-line therapy for allergy-related symptoms and research indicates that they are effective for treating allergy symptoms such as itchiness, but are less effective for congestion. Antihistamine medications (e.g., loratadine/Claritin) are generally well-tolerated, but may have side-effects including headache, sleepiness, fatigue, dry mouth, and sore throat.
 oOral decongestants (e.g., phenylephrine/Sudafed) used to treat congestion have been demonstrated to exert poor to moderate efficacy, and are associated with nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, dizziness, tachycardia, heart palpitations, syncope, headache, sweating, nausea or vomiting, trembling, paleness, and weakness.
 oIntranasal decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline/Afrin) are more effective than oral decongestants. However, they have reduced effectiveness and rebound effects after three days of use and can lead to the development of a serious condition, rhinitis medicamentosa. Additionally, intranasal decongestants cause side effects including nose irritation or burning, sneezing, dizziness, increased blood pressure, tachycardia, heart palpitations, restlessness and insomnia.
 oIntranasal glucocorticoids (e.g., fluticasone propionate/Flonase) have been shown to have the most significant benefits, with some studies showing a 34% reduction in congestion severity after one week of use. Intranasal glucocorticoids have several side effects including epistaxis, dryness, stinging, burning in nose, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, sore throat, and cough.
 Examples of companies developing drugs for pain and congestion include GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer, and Johnson & Johnson.
 Limitations on Use of Pharmaceutical Treatments
 Due to the side effect profiles of pharmaceuticals, many of the above-mentioned treatments carry warnings to discontinue use after two weeks or less according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Additionally, some carry warnings regarding use with certain medications or diseases such as high blood pressure.
Non-pharmaceutical Treatments
 According to Mintel Group Ltd., consumers are increasingly seeking natural, non-pharmaceutical treatment options. Alternative options currently include, without limitation:
 •Nasal irrigation with saline, rinsing the nasal passages with saline solution, is the most common non-pharmaceutical treatment, representing approximately $706 million in sales (based on sales of both nasal irrigation products and related accessories) in the U.S. in 2020. Example products include NeilMed Sinus Rinse, Navage Nasal Care and Vicks Sinex Severe. Nasal irrigation is understudied, but there is some evidence of improved quality of life and clearance of mucus. However, saline can irritate an already inflamed sinonasal tissue and nasal irrigation using tap water has been found to carry risk of parasite-driven encephalitis.


•Bioelectronic devices. ClearUP is the first device globally to have been cleared by the FDA under a de novo classification for the intended use for temporary relief of moderate to severe congestion. The Company also received FDA clearance for the intended use in treatment of sinus pain associated with allergic rhinitis.
 Examples of companies developing non-drug products for sinus pain and congestion include NeilMed, Rhinosystems Inc., and Vapore LLC.
 Principal Competitors
 Over the counter pharmaceuticals have historically had the greatest market share for sinus pain and congestion treatments; however, according to Mintel Group Ltd.’s 2020 report on Cough, Cold, Flu, and Allergy Remedies, and our own online survey, there is increasing interest among consumers to reduce reliance on drugs and to find non-drug solutions. For this reason, other companies selling non-pharmaceutical treatments, specifically nasal irrigation products, represent our closest competitors.
ClearUP is a novel product offering in the non-drug category, an emerging bioelectronic medicine segment, and currently has small market share compared to the existing establishments, most of which offer pharmaceutical options. Currently, ClearUP is the only FDA approved bioelectronic medicine for the treatment of sinus pain and congestion. It is also a CE-Marked medical device for the treatment of sinus pain, pressure and congestion.
 Clinical Research on ClearUP
 Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory disease driven by IgE-mediated reactions to inhaled indoor or seasonal outdoor allergens. The resulting sinus and nasal inflammation may cause symptoms including sinus pain and pressure, nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and nasal itching. Allergic rhinitis affects a significant number of U.S. adults, of which a vast majority experience sinus pain, pressure and congestion as a result of inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa.
 Key Technical Features
 •Treatment Point Detection. ClearUP employs an advanced treatment point detection algorithm that dynamically personalizes to each user. Haptic vibration indicates to the user to hold the device over these points to facilitate stimulation in areas that maximize therapeutic benefit. We have innovated by integrating dynamic measurement with neuromodulation technology to create this novel therapy. (Issued patents: US10625076, US11160978, and US10537738)
 •Monopolar Circuit. ClearUP delivers microcurrent stimulation via a monopolar circuit in which the rounded tip of the device is the active electrode and the conductive housing of the device serves as the return electrode. The monopolar design of ClearUP is a significant improvement over typical bipolar approaches to neuromodulation engineering and facilitates deeper delivery of current and sensitive treatment point detection. (Issued patents: US10625076, US11160978, and US10596374)
 •Proprietary Waveform Delivery. ClearUP delivers a specific frequency, waveform shape, and amplitude of microcurrent that was empirically determined to have fast-acting therapeutic effects on users with common sinonasal symptoms like pain and congestion. Additionally, we have developed an adaptive algorithm that ensures consistent and comfortable delivery of microcurrent treatment on different parts of the face that can have varying electrical properties. (Issued patents: US10625076, US11160978, and US10537738)
 •Ergonomic Design and Ease of Use. ClearUP’s design ensures the product is comfortable to hold and that the hand will always be in contact with the conductive housing of the monopolar circuit. The device shape has also been refined so that the user can navigate the treatment path with ease. Additionally, the single-button control and intuitive indicators make ClearUP Sinus Relief simple to use. Greater than 95% of users report that applying ClearUP Sinus Relief treatment is easy. (Issued patents: US10596374, US10576280)


Two separate clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ClearUP Sinus Relief in treating sinus pain from allergic rhinitis and moderate to severe congestion.
Pivotal Study: randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial
 In July 2018, the Stanford University Sinus Center conducted a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial using the ClearUP bioelectronic device. 71 subjects suffering from sinus pain and congestion used either ClearUP or a sham device. The sham device was identical to ClearUP in every way except that it used a continuous DC output instead of the pulsed AC stimulation used by ClearUP.
 Each subject used the real or sham device for a single five-minute treatment. Before and ten minutes after treatment, subjects completed questionnaires to quantify their symptoms. Subjects treated with ClearUP reported a rapid and clinically meaningful reduction in sinus pain (-29.6%) and congestion (-35%) at ten minutes after treatment.
 This magnitude of change was significantly greater than that observed in sham device-treated subjects.

 Open-label Prospective Trial
 The Allergy and Asthma Associates of Santa Clara Valley Research Center conducted a 30-person study on the use of ClearUP over four weeks. Subjects with sinus pain and congestion used the ClearUP device for five minutes during the study visit and then took the device home with them with instructions to use the device one to four times daily for five minutes per treatment as needed for four weeks. Subjects rated their symptoms weekly using a questionnaire. After the first five-minute treatment with ClearUP, subjects reported reduced sinus pain that remained six hours later, the longest time interval tested in the study. Additionally, subjects reported that after four weeks of use, they experienced an average of 43% reduction in sinus pain and 44% reduction in congestion. This magnitude of change was equivalent to efficacy seen in studies of fluticasone propionate after two-weeks of use.
 PUBLICATION: Goldsobel, A. B., Prabhakar, N., & Gurfein, B. T. (2019). Prospective trial examining safety and efficacy of microcurrent stimulation for the treatment of sinus pain and congestion. Bioelectronic medicine, 5(1), 1-9.
 Safety
 In the clinical studies and post-market surveillance, there have been no reports of any significant side effects and very few reports of minor side effects. Minor side effects have included reddening of skin (0.02%), eyelid twitch (0.01%), and headache (0.01%), all of which resolved without intervention.
New Product Introductions
 We are currently preparing improvements and extensions to our ClearUP product line. Covered by the same patents, our new product offerings under the ClearUP design architecture are expected to decrease the cost of products by decreasing manufacturing, fulfillment and shipping costs.
 Based on our analysis of regulatory guidance issued by the FDA and approval by our designated EU Notified Body (an organization designated by an EU member state to assess the conformity of certain products prior to their release in the EU market), we expect the expansion of our ClearUP product offerings to be covered by existing regulatory clearances applicable to ClearUP.
Research Initiatives: New Product Candidates
 We combine proprietary algorithms, programmable stimulation parameters, and a patented monopolar delivery mechanism to modulate the nerve signals that control inflammation-driven symptoms like pain and congestion. This design has proven effective in treating sinus and nasal inflammatory conditions and we are researching the clinical utility of this stimulation approach for other clinical conditions. This platform has the potential to accelerate new product development by: (i) extending the existing device platform to other clinical areas, thereby reducing research and development time, and (ii) continuing to benefit from low-risk, non-invasive device designations and regulatory pathways by the FDA, which typically result in shorter time to approval when compared with invasive devices or new drugs.
 Numerous inflammatory conditions are associated with peripheral nerve activity of the face, including:
 •chronic quality-of-life conditions such as migraines (39 million U.S.), temporomandibular joint disorder (31 million U.S.), and tinnitus (50 million U.S.);
 •severe, life-altering conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia (150,000 U.S., severe condition); and
 •acute conditions such as ear infections (50% of children) and pain and swelling from facial and sinus surgeries (600,000 functional endoscopic surgeries annually, U.S.).
 Each of these applications would involve regulation of pain and inflammation-related mediators like those seen in sinus and nasal inflammation. Firmware programming of ClearUP allows various stimulation protocols to be used for different disease and neural targets, providing accelerated opportunities for new product candidates at varying price points.
 Activities are ongoing for two product candidates: (i) npdPP, an at home-use device for treating postoperative pain after sinus surgery, and (ii) npdMI, an at home-use device for treating migraine headaches. These product candidates are still in early stages of research and development and will require additional studies and regulatory clearances prior to bringing them to market.
 npdPP: We completed a ten-person pilot study with the U.S. Institute for Advanced Sinus Care and Research (Cleveland, OH) to evaluate a new device for the treatment of postoperative pain after functional endoscopic sinus surgery (“FESS”). The pilot study was conducted to establish clinical feasibility and we subsequently began a double-blind randomized controlled trial with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai to further test this application. Enrollment in this study is continuing.
 npdMI: We are in the process of investigating the area of migraine headaches, which impacts approximately 1 billion people worldwide and 39 million people in the U.S. As part of our research and development activities for migraine, we have been in communication with the FDA to determine the next steps and an appropriate regulatory pathway for expanding our indications. We have completed a market and technology assessment of a potential migraine indication and are developing a clinical protocol related thereto.
 We believe our commitment to non-invasive bioelectronic medicine simplifies clinical trial approaches, improves the safety profile important in regulatory matters, and lowers barriers to adoption once in the market. These factors could afford us a unique opportunity for a rapid pace of innovation relative to other therapeutic companies. While it is our intention to bring new products to market, therapeutic development is inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that our research and development efforts will lead to approved products for other clinical indications.
 Component Sourcing and Manufacturing
 The ClearUP device is comprised of conventional, off-the-shelf electronic components.

Certain of our electronic components are sourced primarily from China. To increase predictability in sourcing and pricing of electronic components used in our products, we maintain an agreement with Future Electronics, Inc., one of the largest global electronic components distributors. The contract has an initial term of 12 months that automatically renews for additional 12-month periods, subject to annual review, and provides for extended payment terms. Future Electronics may terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior written notice if it determines, in its sole discretion, that we are not meeting our minimum purchase requirement or we are otherwise not performing our obligations under the agreement.
 Packaging production is divided between North America and China. The plastic enclosure components and sub-assemblies are produced in China. Materials for both packaging and plastics are commonly available and can be sourced from multiple vendors. Lead times may vary due to supply shortages, customs and port management issues.
 We encountered disruptions in our supply of various materials and components, and electronic components in particular, due to well-documented shortages and constraints in the global supply chain during 2022. Although we currently do not anticipate a supply shortage will continue to pose a material risk for the Company in the near term, we are continuously evaluating alternative and secondary source suppliers in order to ensure that we are able to source sufficient components and materials to manufacture our products. In the event that we are unable to source sufficient components and materials from our current suppliers, or to develop relationships with additional suppliers, to manufacture enough of our products to satisfy demand, we may have to cease or slow down production and our business operations and financial condition may be materially harmed.
 Electronic components are assembled onto printed circuit boards in North America. ClearUP is assembled, tested, warehoused at, and distributed from the San Francisco Bay Area.
 We continue investing in development of the expansion of our ClearUP product line, which is expected to lower product, fulfillment and shipping costs and increase flexibility for line extensions.
The Company has ISO 13485 certification (70488) required to validate the internal processes being compliant with the FDA 21 CFR Part 820 and good manufacturing practices ("GMP"). The Company was re-certified, and the certificates extended until the fourth quarter of 2026.
Intellectual Property / Barriers to Entry
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and other discoveries, inventions, trade secrets and know-how that are critical to our business operations. Our success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and in part, on our ability to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under the section of this Report titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 We rely primarily on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as contractual provisions with employees and third parties, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. Our patent strategy is to pursue broad protection for key technologies, supplemented by additional patent filings covering conceptual methods, specific aspects of current and proposed products, and forward-looking applications and technological developments. We also engage in strategic analysis of our owned patent assets, and pursue additional patent claims from our existing portfolio that may provide us with market advantages. We do not rely heavily on trade secret protection, but do maintain a certain amount of in-house know-how that is not disclosed publicly.
 Our intellectual property portfolio currently consists of:
 •5 issued U.S. patents.
 •21 patents pending in the U.S. and abroad.


•7 trademarks granted in the U.S. and China.
 •2 trademark applications have been filed in the U.S. 
 Our intellectual property portfolio includes a large number of disclosures that cover enhanced cost and manufacturability, performance, ergonomics, comfort, ease of use, system expansion, and treatments performed. Identity is protected by way of trademarks. Various aspects of design and function that cannot be readily reverse engineered are held as trade secrets.
 In most jurisdictions in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of U.S. patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). We intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdiction where these are available and where we also have a patent that may be eligible; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
 Other Barriers to Entry
 We have published high-quality clinical research in high-impact peer reviewed journals, establishing Tivic Health as an evidence-based company. Our first-to-market position has secured a high volume and proportion of positive reviews on our websites and other ecommerce channels. We believe that each of these assets, in addition to our intellectual property and regulatory clearances, will create barriers to entry for competitors.
Government Regulation
 ClearUP is a U.S. FDA Class II and EU Class IIa medical device that has received three regulatory clearances: (US FDA 510(k) number K182025, US FDA De Novo number DEN200006 and EU CE Mark Certificate number CE (704687). Our EU CE Mark Certificate expires in June 2024 and we are in the process of applying for a new EU CE Mark Certificate under the new EU Medical Device Regulations (MDR) 2017/745. We expect to be compliant with the new regulations prior to the EU CE Mark Certificate expiry date.
 Regulation by the FDA
 In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), as well as FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, device safety, premarket clearance, grant, and approval, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, recalls and field safety corrective actions, and post-market surveillance, including complaint handling and medical device reporting of adverse events.
 The FDA classifies medical devices into three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the degree of risk associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls and any other special controls the FDA deems necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class III devices are those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
 De Novo classification is a risk-based classification process. The De Novo process provides a pathway to classify novel medical devices for which general controls alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the intended use, but for which there is no legally marketed predicate device. De Novo classified devices fall either into Class I or Class II and may be marketed and used as predicates for future premarket notification 510(k) submissions.


In 2019, the FDA issued guidance stating that it does not intend to examine low risk general wellness products to determine whether they are devices within the meaning of the FD&C Act or, if they are devices, whether they comply with the premarket review and post-market regulatory requirements for devices under the FD&C Act and implementing regulations. For purposes of its guidance, the FDA defined general wellness products as "products that meet the following two factors: (1) are intended for only general wellness use, as defined in this guidance, and (2) present a low risk to the safety of users and other persons.” Although the FDA classifies our peripheral nerve stimulation platform as a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator (“TENS”) regulated as a Class II medical device, we also intend to pursue development and marketing of general wellness claims and assess if our products fall within the general wellness FDA guidelines.
ClearUP Sinus Relief was cleared under 510(k) number K182025 based on clinical data supporting its safety and efficacy for the temporary relief of sinus pain associated with allergic rhinitis. We were subsequently granted the rights to market ClearUP for the temporary relief of moderate to severe congestion under De Novo number DEN200006.
 Labeling
 All medical devices commercially distributed in the U.S. must comply with specific FDA labeling requirements. These requirements address the labeling (e.g., device label, Instruction for Use, package label, etc.) that must be affixed to the device or packaging and, in the case of devices used by the consumer, provided to all users of the device. Our ClearUP labeling has been reviewed by the FDA as part of our regulatory clearances and our quality management system provides for control of documents to prevent changes that might invalidate FDA’s review.
Quality System Regulation
 The devices that we commercially distribute in the U.S. are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. This includes product listing and establishment registration requirements, which facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions. We adhere to applicable current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements, as set forth in the 21 CFR 820 QSR, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process. We are also required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities, procedures and operations that comply with applicable quality and regulatory requirements. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced or unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities, which may include the facilities of contractors. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from the QSR and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers.
 Post-market surveillance
 We must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting (“MDR”), requirements which require that we review and report to the FDA any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, and any incident in which our device has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. We must also comply with medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require manufacturers to report to the FDA corrections and removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health. Although we may undertake recall actions voluntarily, we must submit detailed information on any recall action to the FDA, and the FDA can order a medical device recall in certain circumstances. To date, we have not been made aware of any reportable incidents that would require us to submit a medical device report to the FDA or any competent authority globally.
 In addition to post-market quality and safety actions, labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the FTC. Medical devices approved, cleared, or granted by the FDA may not be promoted for outside their respective Indication for Use, otherwise known as “off-label” promotion.


Other healthcare laws and regulations
 The healthcare industry is also subject to federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and physician payment transparency laws, as well as patient data privacy and security and consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations. Our operations are also subject to certain state and local laws, including manufacturing license, sales and marketing practices, interactions with consumers, consumer incentive and other promotional programs, and state corporate practice and fee-splitting prohibitions.
 Currently, ClearUP is not reimbursed by any government or private healthcare program, limiting our exposure under certain laws such as the Sunshine Act.
 CE Mark – European Union and other jurisdictions that recognize the CE Mark
 In 2020 we secured the CE Mark CE 704687 allowing sales and marketing of ClearUP in the European Union and in any country that recognizes CE Mark certificate for relief of sinus pain, pressure and congestion, without regard to the cause of pain, pressure and congestion. Sales in such jurisdictions will expose our operations to additional regulations.
 To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may become subject to foreign laws, which may include, for example, applicable post-marketing requirements, including post-market clinical follow up, safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. We must operate our business within the requirements of these laws.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Our current product is purchased on a cash-pay basis and is not covered by government healthcare programs and/or other third-party payors. However, we monitor federal and state legislations and regulatory changes that could affect our results of operations.
 Privacy and security
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health care providers, health plans and health care clearinghouses), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, received, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity.
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards.
In addition, certain states and non-U.S. laws, such as the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and was amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which took effect on January 1, 2023. The CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information and the right to access information about how their data is being used.


Environmental Matters
 Our operations, properties and products are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, use of manufacturing components containing substances below established threshold, air emissions, wastewater discharges, management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous materials and waste and remediation of releases of hazardous materials. We believe, based on current information that we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to us and rely heavily on our outsourced design and manufacturing partners to assist in maintaining compliance.
Facilities
 Our principal executive office is located at 25821 Industrial Blvd., Suite 100, Hayward, California 94545. On November 17, 2021, we entered into a sublease agreement for approximately 9,091 square feet of office and warehouse space. The term of the sublease will expire on October 31, 2025. Monthly rent for the premises is currently $12,609 per month (which will be subject to 3% escalations annually), plus the Company’s pro rata share of operating expenses, which are currently approximately $4,500 per month.
Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 16 full-time employees and four contractors. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
Legal Proceedings
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. We may, however, in the ordinary course of business face various claims brought by third parties, and we may, from time to time, make claims or take legal actions to assert our rights, including intellectual property rights as well as claims relating to employment matters and the safety or efficacy of our products. Any of these claims could subject us to costly litigation. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business.
