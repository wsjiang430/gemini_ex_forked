Recent Developments
 
On February 22, 2023, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors (“Investors”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investors in a best-efforts public offering (the “February 2023 Public Offering”) (i) 3,900,000 shares of Company common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase 3,100,000 shares of Company common stock and (iii) common warrants to purchase 7,000,000 shares of Company common stock. The shares of common stock, or pre-funded warrants in lieu thereof, and the common warrants were sold in units, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock or one pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof and one common warrant. Each unit comprised of common stock and common warrants were sold at a per unit price of $0.50. Each unit comprised of pre-funded warrants and common warrants were sold at a per unit price of $0.495, which represents the same per unit price less the $0.005 per share exercise price of the pre-funded warrants. The Common Warrants are exercisable at a price of $0.55 per share, and have a five year term. The net proceeds from the February 2023 Public Offering were $3.2 million, after deducting Placement Agent fees and other offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company intends to use the net proceeds for (i) general corporate purposes and (ii) potential future acquisitions. General corporate purposes may include working capital, general and administrative expenses, and repayment of outstanding indebtedness. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary technologies or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transactions.
 
On March 28, 2023, Cross River converted approximately $1.1 million principal amount of the March 2022 Convertible Note into 2,275,000 shares of Company common stock. Subject to stockholder approval at the Company’s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Cross River intends to convert the balance of the March 2022 Convertible Note into 322,402 shares of Company common stock and the July 2022 Convertible Note into 2,400,000 shares of Company common stock and 2,400,000 warrants to acquire Company common stock at $0.55 per share.
 
Recent Market Conditions
 
The recovery of the economy from the impact of COVID-19, coupled with global demand for energy products due to international conflicts, has generally had a positive impact on oil prices and hence our business. For the year ended December 31, 2022, WTI crude oil price averaged $94.90 per barrel, versus an average of $68.13 per barrel in the comparable 2021 period, which resulted in an increase in rig count within the markets we serve. We continue to feel the impact of the pandemic, domestic political actions and international activities (including the war in Ukraine) which have continued to impact domestic oil and gas industries. While a slow but continual rebound in active domestic rig count has occurred since the historic lows experienced during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic during mid-2020, rig count as of December 31, 2022 remains below pre-pandemic levels at 779 active rigs, compared to 586 active rigs as of December 31, 2021. The Company has experienced increased demand with micro and macro-economic conditions continuing to continued to improve, allowing the Company to anticipate further improvement compared to the prior year.
 
The Company's expectations for improved activity are somewhat offset by the change in political environment and its uncertain impact on oil exploration and production, as well as increased inflation and rising interest costs. Reductions or limitations in leasing federal property for oil exploration in addition to other measures impacting oil and gas supply and demand have had an impact on the oil exploration and production industry. Finally, to the extent that state and local governments increase regulations, there can be a negative impact to the oil exploration and production industry.
 
The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, OPEC+ actions, USA governmental actions and oil price changes on our operations and financial performance depends on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including any potential resurgence restrictions related to the pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets, any new information that may emerge concerning the severity of other strains of the virus, its spread to other regions as well as the actions taken to contain it, production response of domestic oil producers to lower oil prices, and the adherence to any actions by OPEC+.

Corporate Structure

Enservco Corporation ("Enservco") through its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as the "Company," "we" or "us") provides various services to the domestic onshore oil and natural gas industry. These services include hot oiling and acidizing ("Production Services") and frac water heating ("Completion and Other Services"). Our business operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary, Heat Waves Hot Oil Service LLC ("Heat Waves"), a Colorado limited liability company.
Overview of Business Operations
 
 We provide well enhancement and fluid management services to the domestic onshore oil and natural gas industry. These services include hot oiling and acidizing and frac water heating. We own and operate a fleet of approximately 350 specialized trucks, trailers, frac tanks and other well-site related equipment and serve customers in several major domestic oil and gas areas, including the DJ Basin/Niobrara area in Colorado and Wyoming, the Bakken area in North Dakota, the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico, the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the Jonah area, Green River and Powder River Basins in Wyoming, and the Eagle Ford Shale and East Texas Oilfield in Texas.
 
We currently operate in the following geographic regions:
 

● | Eastern USA Region, including the southern region of the Marcellus Shale formation (southwestern Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia) and the Utica Shale formation in eastern Ohio. The Eastern USA Region operations are deployed from Heat Waves’ operations center in Carmichaels, Pennsylvania. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Rocky Mountain Region, including western Colorado and southern Wyoming (DJ Basin and Niobrara formations), central Wyoming (Powder River and Green River Basins) and western North Dakota and eastern Montana (Bakken formation). The Rocky Mountain Region operations are deployed from Heat Waves’ operations centers in Killdeer, North Dakota, and Longmont, Colorado.
● | Central USA Region, including the Eagle Ford Shale and East Texas Oilfield in Texas. The Central USA Region operations are deployed from operations centers in Jourdanton, Texas, Carrizo Springs, Texas and Longview, Texas. 

 
Historically, the Company focused its growth strategy on strategic acquisitions of operating companies and expansion of services through capital investment consisting of the acquisition and fabrication of property and equipment. That strategy also included expanding into new geographical territories as well as expanding the services it provides. These strategies are exemplified by these activities: 
 

(1) | From 2014 through 2016, the Company spent $33.7 million for the acquisition and fabrication of additional frac water heating, hot oiling, and acidizing equipment; and during 2018, acquired Adler Hot Oil Services, LLC, a provider of frac water heating and hot oiling services, for a gross aggregate purchase price of $12.5 million in order to expand our market share in the Bakken formation, DJ Basin, and Marcellus/Utica Shale formations.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | To expand its footprint, in early 2010 Heat Waves began providing services in the Marcellus Shale natural gas field in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and in September of 2011 Heat Waves extended its services into the DJ Basin/Niobrara formation and the Bakken formation through opening new operations centers in southern Wyoming and western North Dakota, respectively. In late 2012 the Company expanded its operations, through its Pennsylvania operations center, into the Utica Shale formation in eastern Ohio. In early 2015 the Company expanded its operations into the Eagle Ford formation through opening a new operations center in southern Texas. In early 2019 the Company expanded operations in the Powder River Basin by opening a new operations center in Douglas, Wyoming. The lease for this operations center in Douglas, Wyoming expired as of December 31, 2021 and was not renewed. In the second quarter of 2021 the Company again expanded into hot oiling services for the East Texas Oilfield in Texas from our new operations center in Longview, Texas.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) | In January 2016, Enservco acquired various water transfer assets for $4.3 million in order to provide water transfer services to its customers in all its operating areas. This segment was discontinued in 2019. 

Operating Entities
 
As noted above, Enservco conducts its business operations and holds assets through its wholly owned subsidiary entity, Heat Waves. Heat Waves provides a range of well stimulation/maintenance services to a diverse group of independent and major oil and natural gas companies. The primary services provided are intended to: 

(1) | Help maintain and enhance the production of existing wells throughout their productive life; and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Assist in the fracturing of formations for newly drilled oil and natural gas wells.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These services consist of hot oiling and acidizing and frac water heating. Heat Waves also provides water hauling and well site construction services, primarily during the warmer seasons. Heat Waves’ operations are currently in the major oil and natural gas areas in Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

Areas of Operations
 
We serve customers in several major domestic oil and gas areas, including the DJ Basin/Niobrara area in Colorado and Wyoming, the Bakken area in North Dakota, the San Juan Basin in northwestern New Mexico, the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas in Pennsylvania and Ohio, the Jonah area, Green River and Powder River Basins in Wyoming, and the Eagle Ford Shale and East Texas Oilfield in Texas.
 
Operating Segments
 
Enservco, through its operating subsidiary, provides a range of services to owners and operators of oil and natural gas wells in two primary operating segments; production services ("Production Services") and completion and other services ("Completion and Other Services").
Production Services
 
The Company's Production Services segment consists of hot oiling services, acidizing, and pressure testing. Production Services operations are currently in Colorado, Wyoming, North Dakota, Montana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Texas. Production Services accounted for 52% of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 59% for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Hot Oiling Services – Hot oiling services involve the circulation of a heated fluid, typically oil, to dissolve, melt, or dislodge paraffin or other hydrocarbon deposits from the tubing of a producing well. Paraffin deposits build up over time from normal production operations, although the rate at which this paraffin builds up depends on the chemical character of the crude oil or natural gas being produced. These services are performed by circulating and heating oil from a well through a hot oiling truck and then pumping it down the casing and back up the tubing to remove the deposits. As of December 31, 2022, Heat Waves owned and operated a fleet of 50 hot oiling trucks. Based on customer needs and seasonal conditions, these vehicles are deployed among the service regions as necessary in seeking to maximize their productive time.
 
Hot oiling servicing also includes the heating of oil storage tanks. The heating of storage tanks is performed (i) to eliminate frozen water and other soluble waste in the tanks; and (ii) because oil that has been heated flows more efficiently from the tanks to transports hauling oil to the refineries in colder weather.
  
Acidizing – Acidizing entails pumping large volumes of specially formulated acids and/or chemicals into a well to dissolve materials blocking the flow of the crude oil or natural gas. The acid is pumped into the well under pressure. Acidizing is most often used to increase permeability throughout the formation, clean up formation damage near the wellbore caused by drilling, and to remove buildup of materials restricting the flow of crude oil and gas through perforations in the well casing. For most customers, Heat Waves supplies the acid solution and also pumps that solution into a given well. As of December 31, 2022, Heat Waves owned and operated a small fleet of six acidizing units, each of which consists of a specially designed acid pump truck and an acid transport trailer.
 
    6 

  

Pressure Testing – Pressure testing consists of pumping fluids into new or existing wells or other components of the well system such as flow lines to detect leaks. Hot oiling trucks and pressure trucks are used to perform this service. 
Completion and Other Services
 
The Company's Completion and Other Services segment consists of frac water heating and other services. Completion and Other Services operations are currently in Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota, Montana, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. Completion and Other Services accounted for 48% of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 41% for the year ended December 31, 2021.
 
Frac Water Heating – Frac water heating is the process of heating water used in connection with the fracturing process of completing a well. Fracturing services are intended to enhance the production from crude oil and natural gas wells through the creation of conductive flowpaths to enable the hydrocarbons to reach the wellbore where the natural flow has been restricted by underground formations. The fracturing process consists of pumping a fluid slurry, which largely consists of fresh water and a proppant into a well at sufficient pressure to fracture (i.e. create conductive flowpaths) the formation. To ensure these solutions are properly mixed and can flow freely, during certain parts of the year the water frequently needs to be heated to a sufficient temperature as determined by the well owner/operator. As of December 31, 2022, Heat Waves owned and operated a fleet of over 60 frac heaters designed to heat large amounts of water.
 
Other Services – The Company's other services consist primarily of hauling services where the Company utilizes its operating assets that are not deployed to transport both liquid and dry materials for customers.
Ownership of Company Assets 
 
The Company owns various equipment and other assets to provide its services and products. All of the Company's equipment is pledged as security under the Company's 2022 Master Lease Agreement with Utica Leaseco, LLC ("Utica") as of December 31, 2022, which is more fully described in Note 5 - Debt.
 
Historically, as supply and demand require, the Company has leased additional trucks and equipment from time to time. These leases are generally for periods of less than one year, and therefore are treated as operating leases for accounting purposes, and the rent expense associated with these leases is reported in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, Leases. 
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 
We face intense competition in our operations. Competition is influenced by factors such as price, capacity, the quality/safety record/availability of equipment and work crews, and the reputation and experience of the service provider. The Company believes that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled, and well-trained workforce that is responsive to our customers’ needs. Although we believe customers consider all these factors, price is the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded work.
 
The demand for our services fluctuates primarily in relation to the domestic commodity price (or anticipated price) of crude oil and natural gas which, in turn, is largely driven by the domestic and worldwide supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas, political events, as well as speculation within the financial markets. Demand and prices are often volatile and difficult to predict and depend on events that are not within our control. Generally, as supply of oil and natural gas decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers drill new wells and attempt to maximize the productivity of their existing wells to take advantage of the higher priced environment. Conversely, as the supply of commodities increase and demand and crude oil and natural gas prices fall, oil and gas producers drill fewer wells and scale back or suspend service and maintenance work, and put significant pressure on well services providers such as us to reduce prices for our services. Throughout 2020 and 2021, due to depressed crude oil demand and prices resulting from the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, our customers reduced significantly their work orders and demand for our services as well as for the well services of our competitors, which required us to reduce our prices in order to obtain or maintain our business with them. While crude oil prices and demand rebounded in 2022, due to the Russian war with Ukraine and the lessening impacts from COVID-19, we continue to expect that price competition will continue to be intense throughout much of 2023, as oil prices and demand could stabilize or possibly decline in 2023.
 
  7 



The Company’s competition primarily consists of small and large regional or local contractors. The Company attempts to differentiate itself from its competition in large part through its range, availability, and quality of services it has the capability to provide. The Company has invested a significant amount of capital into purchasing, developing, and maintaining a fleet of trucks and other equipment that are critical to the services it provides. Further, the Company concentrates on providing services to a diverse group of major and independent oil and natural gas companies in a number of geographical areas. 
Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
 
The Company serves numerous major and independent oil and natural gas companies that are active in our core areas of operations. 
 
As of December 31, 2022, one customer represented more than 10% of the Company's total accounts receivable balance at 55%. The same customer accounted for 31% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company's top five customers accounted for 57% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.  
 
The loss of one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business until the equipment is redeployed. Further, the Company believes that if its customers shift production from any of the geographies in which it operates the Company could effectively redeploy its equipment into other domestic geographic areas, but it may require us to incur relocation expenses which would reduce operating margins.
 
Seasonality
 
A significant portion of the Company’s operations is impacted by seasonal factors, particularly with regard to its frac water heating and hot oiling services. In 2022, 70% of our revenues were earned during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. In regard to frac water heating, as customers rely on Heat Waves to heat large amounts of water for use in fracturing formations, demand for this service is much greater in the colder winter months. Similarly, hot oiling services are in higher demand during the colder months, as services are needed for maintenance of existing wells and to heat oil storage tanks.
 
Acidizing and pressure testing are performed throughout the year with revenues generally not impacted by weather to a significant degree.
 
Raw Materials
 
             The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials, parts, and components that are made by other manufacturers and suppliers for our use. The Company is not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies or materials. However, there are a limited number of vendors for propane and certain acids and chemicals, and propane prices have been volatile. The Company uses a limited number of suppliers and service providers available to fabricate and/or construct the trucks and equipment used in its hot oiling, frac water heating, and acidizing related services.
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts
 
As is the situation with all companies in the frac water heating service business, we rely on certain procedures and practices in performing our services. In 2016, we were issued our first patent relating to an aspect of the frac water heating process. Heat Waves has since been issued three United States patents and one Canadian patent and has two United States patents pending related to aspects of the frac water heating process. We have other patent applications pending regarding other procedures used in our process of heating frac water. We are aware that one unrelated company has been awarded four patents related, in part, to a process for heating of frac water. 
Government Regulation
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of government regulations ranging from environmental to Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") to the Department of Transportation. Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. These federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, wildlife protection, historic preservation, and health and safety are extensive and changing. The trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards, and we expect that this trend will continue as governmental agencies issue and amend existing regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations as they currently exist or may be amended in the future may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting activities. Adherence with these regulatory requirements increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability. The Company does not believe that it is in material violation of any regulations that would have a significant negative impact on the Company’s operations. 
 
Through the routine course of providing services, the Company handles and stores bulk quantities of hazardous materials. If leaks or spills of hazardous materials handled, transported or stored by us occur, the Company may be responsible under applicable environmental laws for costs of remediating any damage to the surface or subsurface (including aquifers). 
 
  8 



The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as "Superfund," and comparable state statutes impose strict, joint and several liability on owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of "hazardous substances" found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions, demands for reimbursement for government-incurred cleanup costs, or natural resource damages, or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable state statutes govern the disposal of "solid waste" and "hazardous waste" and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for non-compliance, as well as requirements for corrective actions. Although CERCLA currently excludes petroleum from its definition of "hazardous substance," state laws affecting our operations may impose clean-up liability relating to petroleum and petroleum-related products. In addition, although RCRA classifies certain oilfield wastes as "non-hazardous," such exploration and production wastes could be reclassified as hazardous wastes thereby making such wastes subject to more stringent handling and disposal requirements. CERCLA, RCRA and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean-up of sites and disposal of substances found on drilling and production sites long after operations on such sites have been completed. Other statutes relating to the storage and handling of pollutants include the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") which requires certain owners and operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil to prepare and implement spill response plans relating to the potential discharge of oil into surface waters. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to prevention of, reporting of, and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. State laws mandate oil cleanup programs with respect to contaminated soil. A failure to comply with OPA’s requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions.
 
In the course of the Company’s operations, it does not typically generate materials that are considered "hazardous substances." One exception, however, would be spills that occur prior to well treatment materials being circulated downhole. For example, if the Company spills acid on a roadway as a result of a vehicle accident in the course of providing production/stimulation services, or if a tank with acid leaks prior to downhole circulation, the spilled material may be considered a "hazardous substance." In this respect, the Company may occasionally be considered to "generate" materials that are regulated as hazardous substances and, as a result, may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs. Also, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants.
 
The Clean Water Act ("CWA") and comparable state statutes impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or an analogous state agency. The CWA regulates storm water runoff from oil and natural gas facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities. Such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water runoff from its operations. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of oil and other pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release.
The Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") and the Underground Injection Control ("UIC") program promulgated thereunder regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells, such as the disposal wells owned and operated by the Company. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state. The program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal well. Violation of these regulations and/or contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
 
The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the SDWA to exclude hydraulic fracturing from the definition of "underground injection" under certain circumstances. However, the repeal of this exclusion has been advocated by certain advocacy organizations and others in the public. The EPA, at the request of Congress, conducted a national study examining the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources and issued a final assessment report in December 2016, which concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identifies factors that influence these impacts.
 
We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with the environmental laws and regulations described herein. The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement. 
 
If new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities, make it more difficult or costly for our customers to perform fracturing, and/or increase their and our costs of compliance and doing business. It is also possible that drilling and injection operations utilizing our services could adversely affect the environment, which could result in a requirement to perform investigations or clean ups or the incurrence of other unexpected material costs or liabilities.

Significant studies and research have been devoted to climate change and global warming, and climate change has developed into a major political issue in the United States and globally. Certain research suggests that greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change and pose a threat to the environment. Recent scientific research and political debate has focused in part on carbon dioxide and methane incidental to oil and natural gas exploration and production. Many state governments have enacted legislation directed at controlling greenhouse gas emissions, and future state and federal legislation and regulation could impose additional restrictions or requirements in connection with our operations and favor use of alternative energy sources, which could increase operating costs and decrease demand for oil products. As such, our business could be materially adversely affected by domestic and international legislation targeted at controlling climate change.
 
We are also subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including OSHA and comparable state laws, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act, and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.
 
Due to the fact that our trucks travel over public highways to get to customers’ wells, the Company is subject to the regulations of the Department of Transportation ("DOT"). These regulations are very comprehensive and cover a wide variety of subjects from the maintenance and operation of vehicles to driver qualifications to safety. Violations of these regulations can result in penalties ranging from monetary fines to a restriction on the use of the vehicles. Under regulations effective July 1, 2010, an uncured violation of regulations could result in a shutdown of all the vehicles of Heat Waves. The Company does not believe it is in violation of DOT regulations at this time that would result in a shutdown of vehicles.
 
Some states and certain municipalities have regulated, or are considering regulating, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") which, if accomplished, could impact certain of our operations. While the Company does not believe that existing regulations and contemplated actions to limit or prohibit fracking have impacted its activities to date, there can be no assurance that these actions, if taken on a wider scale, may not adversely impact the Company’s business operations and revenues. 
 
Human Capital
 
As of March 9, 2023, the Company employed 98 full-time employees. Of these employees, 87 are employed by Heat Waves and 11 are employed by Enservco. From time to time, the Company may hire contractors to perform work.
