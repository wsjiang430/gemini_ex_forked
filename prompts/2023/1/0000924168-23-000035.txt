ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Overview
Energy Focus, Inc. engages primarily in the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of energy-efficient lighting systems and controls. We develop, market and sell high quality light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting and controls products in the commercial market and military maritime market (“MMM”), and expanded our offerings into the consumer market in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our mission is to enable our customers to run their facilities, offices and homes with greater energy efficiency, productivity, and human health and wellness through advanced LED retrofit solutions. Our goal is to be the human wellness lighting and LED lighting technology and market leader for the most demanding applications where performance, quality, value, environmental impact and health are considered paramount. We specialize in LED lighting retrofit by replacing fluorescent, high-intensity discharge (“HID”) lighting and other types of lamps in institutional buildings for primarily indoor lighting applications with our innovative, high-quality commercial and military-grade tubular LED (“TLED”) products, as well as other LED and lighting control products for commercial and consumer applications. In late 2020, we announced the launch of ultraviolet-C light disinfection (“UVCD”) products. After evaluating market demand and supply chain challenges for our UVCD products, we revised our business strategy to primarily focus on LED lighting and controls products for our MMM and commercial and industrial lighting and control products. We are also evaluating adjacent technologies including Gallium Nitride (“GaN”) based power supplies and opportunities for energy solutions products that support sustainability in our existing channels.
In 2022, we recommitted to building upon the transformation activities started during 2019 and 2020 that sought to stabilize and regrow our business. These efforts include the following key developments that occurred during 2022:
•We hired a permanent Chief Executive Officer in September 2022, following a period of interim leadership by our Lead Independent Director after the departure of our previous Chief Executive Officer in February 2022 and Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer in May 2022.
•We continued development of the second generation of EnFocus™ powerline control switches and circadian lighting system for commercial markets, which as a result of supply chain challenges we now plan to launch in 2023. EnFocus™ powerline control enables buildings to have dimmable, color tunable and circadian-ready lighting using existing wiring, without requiring laying additional cables or any wireless communication systems, through a relatively simple upgrade with EnFocus™ switches and EnFocus™ LED lamps. This upgrade offers a simpler, more secure, affordable and environmentally sustainable solution compared with replacing entire luminaire fixtures and incorporating additional wired or wireless communication.
•We reinvested in our MMM sales channel with a strategic hire in the second quarter of 2022 and are pursuing existing and new sales opportunities, though the sales cycles for what are frequently made-to-order products are longer than commercial offerings.
•Beginning in July 2022, we reduced our warehouse square footage, and undertook an inventory reduction project throughout 2022 focused on reducing our highly reserved commercial finished good inventory.
•The Company has aggressively re-evaluated operating expenses, and reduced our workforce significantly throughout the year to manage fixed costs.
•We continued to seek additional external funding alternatives and sources to support our growth strategies, plans and initiatives:
◦In April 2022, we entered into a note purchase agreement with Streeterville Capital, LLC (“Streeterville”) pursuant to which we sold and issued to Streeterville a promissory note in the principal amount of approximately $2.0 million, with net proceeds of approximately $1.8 million. 
◦ In June 2022, we completed a private placement (the “June 2022 Private Placement”) with certain institutional investors pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell (i) 1,313,462 shares of our common stock, (ii) pre-funded warrants (“June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants”) to purchase 1,378,848 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.0001 per share and (iii) warrants (the “June 2022 Warrants,” and collectively with the June 2022 Pre-Funded Warrants, the “June 2022 Warrants”) to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,692,310 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.30 per share. Net proceeds from the June 2022 Private Placement were approximately $3.2 million. 
◦ From September 2022 to December 2022, we secured short-term unsecured bridge financing of $800 thousand from a member of our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”) and an aggregate of $650 thousand of short-term unsecured bridge financing from private parties, all of which was converted into equity in January 2023 at the time of a strategic investment by Sander Electronics.
◦ In October 2022 and December 2022, we repaid a previously outstanding promissory note with Streeterville by exchanging an aggregate of the approximately $330 thousand amount outstanding for common stock priced at-the-market.
◦ During January 2023, we sold an aggregate of $250 thousand of common stock to a member of our Board of Directors in private placements at fair market value, and also converted the approximately $809 thousand amount outstanding on previously issued short term promissory notes issued to that director as discussed above at fair market value.
◦ In January 2023, we sold an aggregate of $2.7 million of common stock to certain purchasers associated with Sander Electronics, Inc., including conversion of the approximately $609 thousand amount outstanding on previously outstanding short-term promissory notes as discussed above, priced at-the-market. 
◦ In January 2023, we amended our inventory lending facility with Crossroads Financial Group, LLC (the “Inventory Facility”), reducing the maximum availability to $500 thousand, reducing monthly fees and paying down an aggregate of $1 million in January and February 2023.
◦ In January 2023, we amended the terms of our outstanding promissory note with Streeterville, agreeing to make $750 thousand in payments in 2023 and deferring other payments until 2024.
◦ In February 2023, we agreed to terminate our accounts receivable lending facility with Factors Southwest L.L.C. (d/b/a FSW Funding) (the “Receivables Facility” and, together with the Inventory Facility, the “Credit Facilities”), reducing our monthly borrowing costs.
◦ In February 2023, we sold an aggregate of $400 thousand of common stock to a member of our Board of Directors in a private placement at fair market value.
During 2022, we continued to broaden our product distribution network by engaging with new lighting agencies and energy service companies (“ESCOs”). We also redoubled our efforts from 2020 and 2021 to streamline our operations by closely managing all spending done throughout the Company, while investing in new products and strategies that sought to reenergize sales. 
Throughout 2022, due to lingering economic and building occupancy impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced continuing weakness in commercial sales as our customers in the healthcare, education, and commercial and industrial sectors put lighting retrofit projects on hold or delayed order placements. We continue to monitor the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, and to evaluate governmental pandemic response. Although the significance and duration of the ongoing impact on our customers and us is still uncertain, and the specific timing of business recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still difficult to predict, we remain optimistic that facility capital budgets will start unfreezing, commercial building occupancy will rise, and our growth efforts will further impact our financial performance in a positive way.
We will seek to remain agile as an organization to respond to potential or continuing weakness in the macroeconomic environment and in the meantime seek to expand sales channels and enter new markets that we believe will provide additional growth opportunities. We plan to achieve profitability through developing and launching new, innovative products, such as our EnFocusTM powerline control systems, our Redcap® emergency battery backup tubular LEDs, evaluating new growth opportunities such as GaN-based power supply circuitry and other energy solution products, as well as executing on our multi-channel sales strategy that targets key verticals, such as government, healthcare, education and commercial and industrial, complemented by our marketing outreach campaigns and expanding channel partnerships. We also plan to continue to develop advanced lighting and lighting control applications built upon the EnFocusTM platform that aim to serve the commercial markets. In addition, we intend to continue to apply rigorous financial discipline in our organizational structure, decision-making, business processes and policies, strategic sourcing activities and supply chain practices to help accelerate our path towards profitability.
Our Industry
We develop advanced LED lighting and controls retrofit technologies solutions that enable our customers to run their facilities with greater energy efficiency, productivity and human wellness. We aim to be the human wellness lighting and LED technology market leader by providing high-quality, energy-efficient, “flicker-free,” long-life LED lamps and retrofit products, as well as lighting controls, to replace existing linear fluorescent, incandescent, HID lamps and fixtures.
We believe these applications represent a significant portion of the LED lighting market and energy savings potential for our targeted commercial, industrial and MMM markets.
LED lighting, and particularly LED retrofit of fluorescent and incandescent lights in existing buildings, represents a large and growing market. A 2020 report issued by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (“DOE”), entitled “Adoption of Light-Emitting Diodes in Common Lighting Applications,” reports that from 2016 to 2018, 
installations of LED products have increased in all applications, increasing LED penetration to 30% of all general illumination lighting. In 2019, Navigant Research published a report that concluded that LED lighting had at least matched conventional lighting technologies on a range of features, including energy efficiency, lifetime, versatility and color quality, while becoming increasingly cost competitive. This same 2019 report forecasts that installed penetration of LED lamps and luminaires will increase dramatically through 2035, reaching about 84%. The increasing demand for LED lighting is being driven by energy and cost savings, environmental considerations and human health.
Energy consumption can be reduced by over 50% by replacing fluorescent tubes with LED tubes and by another 20-30% (70% to 80% in total) by utilizing smart lighting technologies, including dimmable TLEDs with ambient light and occupancy sensors. For this reason, building codes are increasingly requiring not only LEDs, but dimmable LEDs. Governments around the world are implementing regulations and standards that incentivize the use of LED lighting, both smart and conventional, to reduce energy consumption and, therefore, carbon dioxide emissions. Our new product research and development investments since 2019 have been focusing on advanced and smart lighting technologies to capitalize on these trends, and EnFocus™ represents such a control platform that we aim to expand in terms of functionalities, applications and intelligence, going forward.
There is also a growing awareness of the effects of both visible and non-visible light on human health and well-being. Energy Focus has been a leader in flicker-free technology and one of the first to obtain Underwriters Laboratories (“UL®”) certification at less than 1% optical flicker. Flicker, which is the modulation of the intensity of LED light at the frequency of the power supply, is well known to cause headaches, eye strain, fatigue, mood triggers and other health issues as well as interfering with electronic equipment such as barcode scanners. Energy Focus is continually evaluating additional human wellness lighting and control solutions inspired by emerging health and wellness benefits.
Smart, or connected, lighting is disrupting the LED industry and providing new opportunities for growth. The DOE defines connected lighting as an LED-based lighting system with integrated sensors and controllers that are networked (either wired or wireless), enabling lighting products within the system to communicate with each other and transmit data. In addition to enabling the intensity and correlated color temperature (“CCT”) of lights to respond to ambient light, time of day and the activities of building occupants, connectivity enables building automation functions that extend well beyond lighting. The interference of blue light with human circadian rhythms is well known. This can be alleviated by circadian lighting, or controlled lighting that is able to change the intensity or CCT of the LEDs depending on the time of day in order to emulate natural light. Since lighting fixtures are ubiquitous throughout buildings, the lighting infrastructure is an ideal vehicle to retrofit these and other smart or connected lighting capabilities into existing buildings, and also to design these capabilities into new construction. 
From the customer feedback we have been receiving, we believe that the overall smart lighting market is still largely underdeveloped due to the cost and complexity for installations of related technologies today in the marketplace, representing significant potential for solutions that could meet customer needs and could also be affordable, easy to install and secure. Much of this interest and demand has been muted from 2020 through 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believe has primarily delayed, rather than reduced, our opportunity in the smart lighting marketplace. We believe our EnFocus™ lighting platform could effectively address the unmet needs for circadian and smart lighting, particularly for existing buildings that have limited economical options or IT expertise to implement otherwise complex lighting control systems.
While we believe the LED lighting and smart lighting market is large, growing and under-penetrated, it has also been characterized in recent years by intensifying competition, market leadership changes and aggressive pricing tactics on differentiated products. Our strategy to overcome these challenges is to develop advanced, impactful and customer-centric technologies and products, while also innovating on our core products to increase value and remain competitive. In addition, we focus on executing our multi-channel sales strategy combined with a growing sales representative network to drive effective and frequent communication with customers in order to better understand and serve their needs. By understanding the voice of the customer and by incorporating rapidly evolving technologies surrounding LED and smart lighting, we believe that we will continue to be able to develop solutions that better address customers’ needs with unique and novel product offerings, such as EnFocus™, our dimmable and tunable lighting and control platform, that deliver substantial value to our customers and accelerate LED and smart lighting adoptions.
Our Products
We design, develop, manufacture and market a wide variety of LED lighting technologies and solutions to serve our primary end user markets, including the following: 
Commercial products to serve our targeted commercial markets:

•Emphasis on proprietary and patent-pending technologies surrounding LED lighting; and
•A deep understanding of LED lighting product applications in existing MMM, government, commercial and residential building markets. 
As we seek to develop new LED lighting solutions, we expect to continue our investments in smart lighting and wellness lighting research and development, as well as channel partnerships. Lighting controls, including dimming, sensor and daylighting technologies, can yield significant energy savings and human health benefits. We believe that the controllability of LED technology and our ability and plan to integrate more occupancy sensing and other controls into our existing products will allow us to further differentiate our LED solutions and provide greater non-energy benefits to our customers.
Sales and Marketing
Our innovative technologies and high-quality performance associated with LED lighting require a continued focus on educating our channel partners as well as end-users regarding the benefits and unique value propositions of our technologies and products. Our primary target customers for our LED lighting and controls systems are enterprise end-users, as well as contractors or ESCOs that could incorporate our products into their projects. We also sell through lighting agencies that represent our products 
as a complement to our direct sales effort. We have in-house commercial sales personnel and external sales agencies representing Energy Focus products. We aim to continue to expand the coverage of our in-house sales team to eventually cover all geographic regions across the United States. Our MMM sales strategy leverages our brand and past performance and focuses on education about our products as well as ease of procurement.
We focus on industry verticals where the economic and non-economic benefits such as health and safety, as well as technical specifications, of our high-quality lighting product offerings are most compelling. Our LED lighting products fall into two broad market categories, commercial markets, which tend to focus on quality, efficacy, total cost of ownership and return on investment, and MMM which require more rigorous military specifications for durability and dependability. We also entered consumer markets during fiscal year 2021. We expect that our multi-channel sales strategy will continue to evolve and expand in the future.
With the introduction of our military-grade Intellitube® product in 2011, which replaced two-foot fluorescent lamps on U.S. Navy ships, military sales have represented the majority of our overall sales. Since 2019, we have been focusing on improving the design of our MMM products to significantly reduce product costs while maintaining the required performance. These efforts helped offset some of the weakness experienced in our commercial business due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, though sales levels were challenged as the amounts and timing of military funding fluctuated. While we continue to aggressively pursue growth on the commercial side of our business due to its much larger potential and size, the MMM business does offer us the opportunity for continued sales, in addition to validating our product quality and strengthening our brand trust in the marketplace. During 2022, we reinvested in our military sales channel with a strategic hire of a U.S. Navy veteran who specializes in government sales. This has allowed us to better engage with the MMM and has presented us with the potential for expansion in military sales beyond the existing product portfolio.
We launched our first commercial LED lighting products in 2010. Since then, we have been building and expanding our commercial and industrial market presence where the economic and non-energy benefits and technical specifications of our high-quality lighting product offerings are compelling, particularly for mission-critical facilities in the enterprise verticals such as healthcare, eldercare, education and the commercial and industrial space. For example: 
•Given the 24/7 lighting requirements of hospital systems, we believe that our LED solutions offer the proven quality, performance, long lifetime, return on investment and low flicker lightning that is particularly attractive to this target market. Since 2015, we have been the primary LED lighting supplier and partner for a major northeast Ohio hospital system and, as a result of our continued success, we have been able to leverage this relationship to expand into more hospital systems across the country.
•As we advocate for the benefits of low-flicker LED lighting in schools, both in terms of energy-efficiency and in creating a healthy and effective learning environment, we continue to receive orders to retrofit school districts, colleges and universities.
•Low and high bay applications are generally used in commercial and industrial markets to provide light to large open areas like big-box retail stores, warehouses and manufacturing facilities. In the past few years, technological and cost improvements have allowed LED low and high bay applications to be more competitive, and we believe we have attractive product offerings in this space that enable energy and maintenance cost savings.
In addition to our direct and indirect sales force, we have also re-evaluated our own e-commerce websites. At our current scale, we have returned to our core sales channels to commercial and military customers, but will continue to evaluate additional channels from time-to-time. We believe that our renewed and continuing focus on multi-disciplinary technology innovation and engineering designs to both expand product features and benefits, while lowering product costs of ownership, will continue to enhance the overall competitiveness of our LED lighting and provide us with the strategic advantage and flexibility to expand our distribution channels.
Concentration of Sales
In 2022, two customers accounted for 27% of net sales, with sales to our primary distributor for the U.S. Navy accounting for approximately 13% of net sales, and sales to a regional commercial lighting retrofit company accounting for approximately 14% of net sales. When sales to our primary distributor for the U.S. Navy are combined with sales to shipbuilders for the U.S. Navy, total net sales of products for the U.S. Navy comprised approximately 30% of net sales for the same period. 
In 2021, two customers accounted for 43% of net sales, with sales to our primary distributor for the U.S. Navy accounting for approximately 30% of net sales, and sales to a regional commercial lighting retrofit company accounting for approximately 13% of net sales. When sales to our primary distributor for the U.S. Navy are combined with sales to shipbuilders for the U.S. Navy, total net sales of products for the U.S. Navy comprised approximately 38% of net sales for the same period.
Competition 
Our LED lighting products compete against a variety of lighting products, including conventional light sources such as compact fluorescent lamps and HID lamps, as well as other TLEDs and integrated LED luminaire products. Our ability to compete depends substantially upon the superior performance, incremental benefits and lower total cost of ownership of our products. Principal competitors in our markets include large lamp manufacturers and lighting fixture companies based in the United States, as well as TLED and LED replacement fixture manufacturers mostly based in Asia, whose financial resources may substantially exceed ours and whose cost structure as a percentage of sales may be well below ours. These competitors may introduce new or improved products that may reduce or eliminate some of the competitive advantage of our products and may have substantially lower pricing. We anticipate that the competition for our products will also come from new technologies that offer increased energy efficiency, lower initial costs, lower maintenance costs, or advanced features. We compete with LED systems produced by large lighting companies such as Signify Lighting, Osram Sylvania and GE Lighting, as well as smaller manufacturers or distributors such as LED Smart, Revolution Lighting Technologies, Orion Energy Systems, and Keystone Technologies. Some of these competitors offer products with performance characteristics similar to those of our products.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We produce our lighting products and systems through a combination of internal manufacturing and assembly at our Solon, Ohio facility, and sourced finished goods, manufactured to our specifications. Our internal lighting system manufacturing consists primarily of final assembly, testing, and quality control. We have worked with several vendors to design custom components to meet our specific needs. Our quality assurance program provides for testing of all sub-assemblies at key stages in the assembly process, as well as testing of finished products produced both internally and sourced through third parties. Additionally, we are 9001-2015 ISO certified.
Manufacturing costs are managed through the balance of internal production and outsourced production for certain parts and components, as well as finished goods in specific product lines, to a small number of vendors in various locations throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Malaysia, Taiwan, and China. In some cases, we rely upon a single supplier to source certain components, sub-assemblies, or finished goods. We continually attempt to improve our global supply chain practices to satisfy client demands in terms of quality and volumes, while controlling our costs and achieving targeted gross margins, and this includes the evaluation of additional outsourcing or further insourcing of internal production where cost, quality and performance can be maintained or improved. A 2021 DOE report entitled, “2020 LED Manufacturing Supply Chain”, indicated that most of the world’s LED lamp production and a significant portion of LED luminaire manufacturing takes place in China with virtually no LED lamp manufacturing taking place in the United States today. 
Our supplier concentration is heavily focused within Asia. As a result of the continued macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, throughout 2021 and 2022, we experienced global supply chain and logistics constraints that impacted our inventory purchasing strategy and increased our transportation costs, in continued efforts to manage both shortages of available components and longer lead times in obtaining components. 
One offshore supplier accounted for approximately 16% of our total expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, this same offshore supplier accounted for approximately 36% of our trade accounts payable balance.
One offshore supplier accounted for approximately 29% of our total expenditures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, this same offshore supplier accounted for approximately 60% of our trade accounts payable balance.
Product Development 
Product development has been a key area of operating focus and competitive differentiation for us in designing and developing industry leading LED lighting. Gross product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively. We believe that our customer-centric product development efforts represent a better leverage on our R&D investments and aim to continue to focus on developmental projects that could produce more impactful and differentiated products and solutions in a more timely manner for faster customer adoption.
Intellectual Property
We have a policy of seeking to protect our intellectual property through patents, license agreements, trademark registrations, confidential disclosure agreements, and trade secrets as management deems appropriate. Certain of our patents are key to our current product lines. Additionally, we have various pending U.S. patent applications, and various pending Patent Cooperation 
Treaty patent applications filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization that serve as the basis for national patent filings in countries of interest. Our issued patents expire at various times through May 2040. Generally, the term of patent protection is twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. There can be no assurance; however, that our issued patents are valid or that any patents applied for will be issued, and that our competitors or clients will not copy aspects of our lighting systems or obtain information that we regard as proprietary. There can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop products similar to ours. The laws of some foreign countries in which we manufacture, sell or may sell our products do not protect proprietary rights to products to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 
Insurance
All of our properties and equipment are covered by insurance and we believe that such insurance is adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability, product recall and workers’ compensation insurance in amounts we believe to be consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice. 
Regulatory Compliance
We derive a significant portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Contracts with government customers are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, business prerequisites to qualify for such contracts, accounting procedures, intellectual property processes, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance, which may provide for various rights and remedies in favor of the governments that are not typically applicable to or found in commercial contracts.
In addition, although not legally required to do so, we strive to obtain certification for substantially all our products. In the United States, we seek certification on substantially all of our products from UL®, Intertek Testing Services (“ETL®”), or DesignLights Consortium (“DLC™”). Where appropriate in jurisdictions outside the United States, we seek to obtain other similar national or regional certifications for our products. Although we believe that our broad knowledge and experience with electrical codes and safety standards have facilitated certification approvals, we cannot ensure that we will be able to obtain any such certifications for our new products or that, if certification standards are amended, we will be able to maintain such certifications for our existing products.
Human Capital
At December 31, 2022, we had 20 full-time employees and 3 furloughed employees, all of whom were based in the United States, and no part-time employees. We had one temporary contractor at December 31, 2022. None of our employees or contractors are subject to collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. We encourage and support the growth and development of our employees. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees and reimbursement is available to employees from time to time for seminars, conferences, formal education, and other training events employees attend in connection with their job duties.
Our core values of accountability, trust, extraordinariness, fun, openness, integrity and kindness underscore everything we do and drive our day-to-day interactions. The safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, we embraced a flexible work environment with some of our corporate office employees effectively working from remote locations and others working both remotely and in the office on a hybrid basis.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our current and future employees. The principal purposes of our annual bonus plan and equity incentive plan are to attract, retain and motivate employees through the granting of long-term incentive compensation awards.
