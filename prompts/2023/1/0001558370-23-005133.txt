Overview
​
We are seeking to reshape the world of electronics with our proprietary organic semiconductor platform that we believe has the potential to affect the form and function of the next generation of low-cost displays and sensors. Our patented TRUFLEX® inks are solution deposited at a low temperature, on low-cost substrates to make OTFT circuits. Our organic semiconductor platform can be used in a number of display technologies including miniLEDs, microLED and AMOLED displays that can drive televisions, laptops AR and VR headsets, smartwatches and smartphones. We have a research and development facility in Manchester, UK, and manufacture product protypes for prospective customers using our semiconductor manufacturing processes housed at the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) at Sedgefield, UK. We have an extensive IP portfolio including 125 granted patents across 19 patent families, and 40 codified trade secrets.
​
Our Technology
 ​
The invention and development of FET devices has enabled the rapid expansion of the electronics industry, particularly with the advent of the planar process essential for integrated circuitry. This is due to the ability to create compact circuits with an ever-increasing capability, lower cost per logic function, and a higher frequency of operation. Integrated circuits are present in almost all electronic devices today and there is a constant drive to embed smart features into a greater number of applications.
 ​
TFTs are a type of FET that can be processed on large area flat surfaces to make display screen backplanes, digital/analog electronics, and sensor arrays for a wide range of consumer and industrial applications. The manufacturing of silicon-based electronics either in wafer or thin-film form, such as a-Si on glass, requires a high temperature process (approximately 300°C). Because plastic materials melt at high temperatures, TFTs are manufactured on special glass that can withstand such high temperatures and are used to produce mainly rigid products.
 ​
Our OTFT technology comprises predominantly organic materials (such as polymers and organic small molecules) that can be solution coated at low temperature (as low as 80°C) onto a wide range of low-cost plastic substrates, as well as traditional substrate materials. The similarity in stretchability and coefficient of thermal expansion between the substrate and our TRUFLEX® materials permits production of robust, bendable/flexible and lightweight devices. Our OTFT performance, as measured by charge mobility, exceeds a-Si performance by a factor of four, which we believe offers product designers a significant extension of capability, by enabling them to transform flat, bulky objects into lightweight, robust, and flexible products that we expect will appeal to consumers.
 ​
Our OSC materials use a polycrystalline small molecule with high mobility, together with a low molecular weight semiconducting polymer, to control the morphology, phase segregation and uniformity of the semiconducting layer and a solvent to deliver inks that are used to make devices with mobilities in excess of 4 cm2/Vs. In addition, we have developed all the other layers that are necessary to form the complete transistor stack.
 ​
Plastic substrates, such as PET, PEN, TAC and COC have relatively low Tg in the range of 100°C to 200°C. Using these plastics at temperatures above this level causes significant distortion and, in some instances, may even result in melting or thermal breakdown of the polymer. Our OTFTs can be processed at temperatures as low as 80°C, enabling the use of polymer substrates that are optically clear and low-cost. In addition, short duration processing at low temperature results in significant energy savings. Also, plastics do not have the same risk of shattering as glass and therefore less strengthening around the edge of large area plastic-bases devices is necessary, such as the use of aluminum frames to support torsional rigidity. Plastics can also be processed in very thin sheets (tens of microns) which saves space that can be used for increased battery capacity. Thin plastic substrates also enable the device to conform very easily to non-planar

surfaces such as the human body which makes them well suited for wearable sensor and display devices. Thin plastic sheets are also conformable, allowing electronics to be curved around irregular surfaces.
 ​
Our BL, SAM, OSC, OGI, SRL and PV inks can be deposited using standard coating techniques such as spin-coating or slot-die coating which are widely used for the lithography processes used in TFT manufacturing. As a result, our OTFT process can be integrated into existing manufacturing lines using standard industrial techniques without the need for large capital investment. Furthermore, the solubility of our inks would permit customers to digitally print the features of the OTFT device, which we believe may be attractive to potential customers seeking to lower manufacturing costs. 
​
In February 2023, we joined the collaborative Hi-Accμracy project that brings together eleven of the most
innovative and forward-thinking companies in the industry in a bid to establish the next generation of OLAEs – including OTFT and EL-QD-LED based displays. Our role will include developing an OTFT back-plane upon which a QD-LED front-plane will be printed. The resulting 300ppi RGB display will showcase the performance of our range of
TRUFLEX® materials when used in conjunction with micron scale additive patterning processes and low temperature
processing conditions. As part of the Hi-Accµracy project, printing of our OSC inks is being trialed using high resolution and high efficiency Reverse Offset Printing and Electrostatic Jetting as a route to future large area manufacture of flexible OLAE structures such as OTFTs and EL-QD-LED displays.
 ​
Products and Services 
​
We have internally developed all the materials necessary to fabricate high-performance OTFT devices except for the contact metals and substrates on which those materials are deposited. We supply our products as a set of stable liquid inks, with each ink forming a separate layer of the device. Each of the inks forming these layers has been carefully designed to result in the device performance and electrical stability required by the customer. We supply the ink set with a detailed POR for making the desired device. In addition to supplying our OTFT stack materials as a package, prospective customers are evaluating the use of our range interlayer materials as single layers in new and existing chip and display products, such as redistribution layers, pixel definition layers, permanent resists and organic dielectric layers due to the favorable processability, patternability and other properties of our materials when compared with existing materials.
 ​
Products have been scaled up for formulated ink supply to customers in packages sizes ranging from 100mL to several liters. These are supplied with CoA and POR alongside device and design consultancy to ensure successful technology transfer.
 ​
We intend to offer foundry services to customers who wish to have electronic circuits manufactured for them. Through arrangements with the United Kingdom’s CPI, we have access to a 2.5 generation (370mm x 470mm) foundry that we use for creating prototypes for evaluation by potential customers. In 2022 we began process characterization using a maskless aligner at CPI to reduce the time from CAD layout to prototype for new designs. Additionally, in partnership with The Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan, we successfully demonstrated the direct patterning of one of our interlayer dielectric materials using digital lithography technology (DLT).
​
We do not have the ability to produce our flexible transistors at commercial scale and intend to seek relationships with existing foundries that are capable of producing our products at commercial scale to provide us with the ability to meet full production orders for customers that do not have their own facilities. We use product prototyping services to demonstrate applications enabled by OTFT to prospective customers. This allows potential customers seeking to evaluate physical samples of our materials prior to committing to purchase.
​
In early 2023, we announced the creation of the first monolithic micro-LED display using OTFTs. We believe that by simplifying the process of connecting transistors to LEDs, there is the potential to accelerate the commercialization of micro-LED displays. Consumer electronics companies are actively developing micro-LED displays since they promise higher brightness, lower power consumption and longer lifetime. We believe this will be particularly important for portable powered displays such as smartwatches and AR/VR displays which cannot readily accommodate large batteries.

Advantages of Our TRUFLEX® Technology
 ​
The most widespread technology is a-Si which is principally used in the manufacture of backplanes for LCDs. More recent developments in inorganic semiconductors include use of the metal oxide IGZO for backplanes for large area OLED TVs and LTPS for high resolution cell phones. All these inorganic processes are operated at high temperatures and therefore require high-cost substrates, especially if they are to be processed on plastic. All are subject to failure on bending, have limited flexibility, and require additional product engineering for protection during bending to prevent failure of the display. This adds to the overall cost of production of a bendable or foldable device.
 ​
Our ability to employ TRUFLEX® materials at temperatures as low as 80°C enables manufacturers to use low-cost plastic substrates and the organic nature of our materials allows the transistors to be truly flexible. We believe that robust and lightweight display screens which are capable of being bent or folded would enable manufacturers of mobile devices to create products more tailored to customer demand and that our TRUFLEX® OFTFs are uniquely suited for this application. Our materials are organic and hence can withstand the strains experienced in severe bending such as a fold of a display. In addition, the substrate does not require the degree of protection from the edges as glass displays do which can eliminate the weight and cost associated with aluminum frames. Low temperature processing enables a wider range of plastic substrates to be used, allowing properties such as optical clarity to be optimized.
​
There are also opportunities to process the OTFT on top of other display elements, such as a micro-LED array since the low process temperature would not damage the emissive components. We believe this ability to pattern the backplane on top of other components could lead to alternative display or sensor design configurations with advantages such as higher aperture ratio. We also believe that our ability to build the backplane in-situ over the micro-LED array — which would eliminate the critical front and backplane hybridization step — has the potential to increase the yield of the display fabrication process. The small size of micro-LED’s and tight pixel pitches makes it challenging to ensure each micro-LED aligns perfectly with the corresponding pixel driver on the backplane. Additionally, hybridization processes can introduce a thermal mismatch between the front and backplane materials causing micro-LEDs to crack or fail from the mechanical stress and can produce a non-uniform bond between the two layers. We believe our monolithic build process will greatly reduce or eliminate these issues. Moreover, when micro-LEDs are directly integrated into the backplane using a monolithic process there is no requirement for the supplementary layers and interfaces needed in some production methods to bond the two pieces together — consequently optical losses should be reduced, and overall efficiency of the display should be improved.
​
​
Market Opportunity
 ​
According to Precedence Research, the global display market size was valued at $168.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to hit around $297.1 billion by 2030, expanding growth at a CAGR of 7.35% from 2022 to 2030. Growth in the display market is driven primarily by increasing demand for consumer electronics, including smart phones, automotive products, e-readers and flat panel displays. We believe that display manufacturers continue to seek product differentiation as a part of their marketing strategies.
 ​
Our TRUFLEX® materials enable customers to make backlight units that are both flexible and can drive high currents stably. Over the last two years several manufacturers have launched TVs with mini-LED backlight units and a number of companies are developing a new generation of direct emission micro-LED displays, flexible OLED displays, and transparent OLED displays. These new formats are supported by a variety of different backplanes using tiled versions of existing technologies or PCB backplanes. We believe that TRUFLEX® materials can be used to provide active-matrix transistor arrays that can address all of these new product categories using low-cost, flexible substrates. As products become more sophisticated and smart technology is implemented in wider use cases, we expect that manufacturers will seek technology solutions, such as our TRUFLEX® technology that enable them to implement the product designs that consumers will demand.
​
In addition, we believe that our OTFTs are suitable for applications where a relatively low number of transistors are required over a wide area such as sensors or distributed logic circuits.

Commercialization Strategy 
 ​
A large sector of our target customers are large consumer electronics companies based in Asia (Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and China) that already own or have access to display backplane manufacturing lines and engage in large scale production of display products for TV or mobile/tablet markets using a-Si process lines. We believe that these companies are continually seeking to create novel, higher added value electronics products that cannot be manufactured using a-Si glass backplanes. We believe these potential customers will be attracted to our TRUFLEX® technology which would enable them to create novel, plastic-based products with improved robustness, higher flexibility and lighter weight using their existing production lines.
 ​
Other potential customers may not have access to display manufacturing lines and will seek a complete solution for their needs, including production capability. These are often companies who will use displays as a component within their products and will buy from Asian manufacturers according to what is available at the time. We can provide prototype production from the Gen 2.5 line at CPI. We intend to scale this capability by partnering with one or more foundry providers to scale up our ability to meet full production orders for customers that do not have their own facilities. Once the demand for our backplanes has exceeded our ability to supply products then the market pull would be sufficient to engage Asian display makers to transfer production to their facilities.
 ​
Our market strategy includes the identification of specific capabilities or products that we believe can most benefit from our TRUFLEX® technology. This identification process may involve our marketing efforts or feedback and requests from potential customers. As described below, once a commercial opportunity is identified, we will engage in a process of demonstration and evaluation with the potential customer.
 ​
Our strategy also involves the design and sale of materials for use as logic devices or circuits. Once we have identified a specific application requirement, we expect to proceed with development work through an understanding of the product specifications and engineering work to calculate the size and capabilities of pixel TFTs and storage capacitors. For digital logic applications, the situation is more complex, and circuits cannot be designed without access to supporting simulation, design, and layout software. In silicon IC design, EDA tools are used to predict the behavior of circuits made using foundry services. This allows designers to simulate the behavior of prototype circuits and check their functionality ahead of the fabrication, therefore saving time and money.
 ​
We have developed an initial PDK for our process that is designed to be used by third parties in EDA software to allow them to design digital logic devices. The PDK contains information such as design rules that are specific to our process equipment, and it will also incorporate models of OTFTs made using our materials set. This will be used for digital device simulation and layout of circuit designs. We continue to characterize the electrical performance of our materials and to use that data to improve the correlation between simulations produced using those tools and actual devices. As part of this development, we expect to populate a library of reference designs for common gates used in digital electronic circuits to further simplify third party design processes.
 ​
Sales and Marketing
 ​
We have a direct sales force consisting of two employees located in Taiwan, and sales representation in China. Our CEO and management team are also actively engaged in developing customer and partner relationships. We believe that our initial customers will be located in Taiwan, Japan and the Peoples Republic of China but we are also directly working with OEMs located in North America, Europe and Asia who have the ability to require their suppliers to use our materials. Our sales team is supported by engineers and product specialists located at our headquarters in the U.K. We intend to seek third-party distribution or sale-agent agreements with potential partners where we believe such agreements are justified by the potential market opportunity.
​
Our sales and marketing efforts were adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, travel to and from Asia and other regions was significantly restricted. As a result, we had to cease virtually all business travel and sought to increase our presence in affected markets through other means, including engaging sales representation in China. In addition, many of our expected customers are located in Asia, which has imposed severe lock-down restrictions in an effort to combat the pandemic. Those customers have reported supply shortages and 

10



manufacturing delays as a result of the pandemic and the related restrictions, which has had a material adverse impact on the expected markets for our products. In addition, shipping costs have increased significantly as a result of limitations on other modes of transportation. Pandemic restrictions have now been mostly lifted in these territories, allowing business travel to recommence. 
​
Our marketing efforts include attendance at significant industry tradeshows at which we demonstrate the capabilities of our TRUFLEX® technology and responding to requests for proposals and other inquiries from potential customers. We publish technical papers that explain our products and technology to inform and engage with potential customers. We also have entered into a number of joint development agreements to demonstrate the capabilities of our materials and to show the feasibility of utilizing our products in specific applications. In addition, we make presentations at trade events to showcase our technology and familiarize potential customers with the value we believe our technology adds to various applications. We also publish press releases and other announcements relating to our technical capabilities or achievements and include product information and related technical materials on our website.
  ​
We expect that the time between the identification of a potential customer and the receipt of a purchase order or agreement for the sale of our products will be relatively long. In certain instances, a potential customer may contact us seeking a generic sample of our materials for evaluation. In other instances, a customer may come to us with specific performance specifications and inquire about our ability to provide products meeting their specifications after which we provide samples of materials or specific data for evaluation. After the initial evaluation, the prospective customer may request a prototype of a specific design as a proof-of-concept. We fabricate prototypes using the Gen 2.5 foundry access we have through our arrangement with CPI. A significant proportion of all work done during this phase of our sales cycle would be done at our expense, with customers making a contribution in some cases.
 ​
Assuming successful prototyping is completed, we expect that we would negotiate and enter into a development agreement with an interested customer under which we would, in collaboration with the potential customer, engage in further engineering and design work. We expect that we would receive compensation for those services. We might also engage in pilot-scale level manufacturing of the products developed for the customer as part of that process.
 ​
After the satisfactory completion of development work and any related pilot project, an interested customer would then enter into a sales agreement with us under which we would either agree to manufacture products to the customer’s specifications from time to time as requested by the customer, including potential minimum quantity requirements, or we would agree to license our process to the customer for a fee based on a royalty of sales and enter into a supply agreement for our proprietary inks, utilizing a process owned and qualified by us, formulated into inks either in our own facilities or by third-party formulators and shipped directly to customers.
 ​
We expect that the sales cycle described above will take approximately 12-24 months. During that period, we will be required to incur significant expenses without any assurance that a customer order will be obtained. Accordingly, we will have a significant risk that we will incur those expenses without ever making a sale.
​
In October 2021, we entered into a joint development agreement with RiTdisplay, a Taiwan based developer of displays. Under this agreement the two parties are collaborating on the production of a full color demonstration AMOLED display.
​
In February 2022, we entered into a joint development agreement with Nanosys Inc., a leader in developing and delivering quantum dot and micro-LED technology. Under this agreement the two parties will work together on a new generation of low-cost solution printed micro-LED and quantum dot materials for advanced displays.
 ​
Research and Development
 ​
To-date, we have focused our resources on the development of improved performance organic semiconductors which have high charge mobility, excellent uniformity, device stability and robustly satisfy the TFT performance specifications defined by potential customers. Our portfolio of available organic semiconductors has been extended as a result of these efforts to include newly synthesized small molecules. Our chemistry team, led by our Chief Scientist, has in-depth knowledge of structure-property relationships for organic materials. Dielectric and passivation interlayer

materials are also critical to enabling the OTFT device current to be maximized while ensuring stability during extended operation under voltage or current bias stress. Some of the critical parameters for performance of an OTFT device include:
 ​

● | Charge mobility – the ability of the material to conduct charge under an electric field. The higher the charge mobility number the greater the current that can be driven through the device for a given size. Also, in circuits mobility determines the maximum switching frequency of a device from one logic state to another. a-Si has a mobility of ~0.5 cm2/Vs, LTPS typically has mobility >50 cm2/Vs and crystalline silicon has a mobility of near 1000 cm2/Vs. SmartKem’s OTFTs can achieve >3 cm2/Vs at channel length of 4 microns and >4cm2 at 10 microns.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | On/off ratio – the ratio of the current driven by the transistor during its on state to the current passed during biasing in its off state. On/off ratios of >10˄6 are typically required for TFTs used in display pixels so that the programmed voltage does not decay during the frame time. Our OTFTs have on/off ratios in the order of 10˄7 and have even demonstrated 10˄9 on/off ratio in large W/L devices.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Turn on voltage (Vto) – the gate voltage at which the TFT starts to increase its current output. Values close to zero volts are considered desirable for low power consumption products. The device should also achieve its transition from off to on over as small a range of gate voltages as possible since this can reduce energy consumption and hence is desirable in battery powered devices.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Threshold voltage (Vth) - gate-source voltage at which the magnitude of the drain current reaches a specified low value (e.g., 10˄-9A).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Threshold voltage (Vth) stability – The ability of device to maintain a defined threshold or turn on voltage following a period of electrical stress (either at room temperature or elevated temperature). Bias voltage shifts of <2V after 1 hour voltage stress at 60°C and +30V or -30V is a typical specification required for display applications. We have demonstrated <1V Vth bias stress shift for NBTS and <2V for PBTS in R&D tests. We are working on integrating this capability into our full five-mask device stack.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
More recently, in response to requests from potential customers, our chemistry team has focused on the development of a range of specialized polymer interlayers. Some of these materials are intended for use in the display industry as redistribution layers and as pixel definition layers. Additional specialty dielectric polymer formulations are being designed for use in advanced mobile communications operating at frequencies in excess of 5GigaHz (5G applications and beyond). We believe our novel dielectrics should enable manufacturers to offer higher bandwidth and faster speed with lower power consumption. Interlayer inks are also being provided to potential customers for evaluation across a range of applications.
 ​
Once new materials have been characterized, our materials process development team customizes the formulations and process parameters to allow integration into the device process at CPI. This team establishes the BKMs for each material and generates an understanding of the parameters that can influence the performance. Initial work may also be done to plan scale up routes for the materials in anticipation of the need to supply to customers.
 ​
The generation of fabrication processes and the integration of new materials is carried out at CPI under the direction of our Chief Technology Officer. The toolsets at this site provide a rapid feedback loop between our chemistry R&D and industry relevant device performance data sets. Additionally, the equipment sets can be used to generate demonstrator OTFT backplane devices on plastic, OTFT driven displays, sensors or circuits and a wide range of other device prototypes Technology transfer to customers’ pilot lines can also be supported by this team and they can help to diagnose and rectify process problems. Process engineers also travel to customers’ sites to assist technology transfer alongside our field application engineering team in Taiwan. Through this work, we believe we have developed a novel method for integration of OTFT backplanes and micro-LED devices. We believe this process is feasible due to the low temperature processing of OTFT. We believe that the use of higher temperature materials, such as a-Si, LTPS and IGZO, would damage the LED devices. As a result, current practice is to attach the micro-LEDs after the backplane is fabricated. Using our process, we have demonstrated active matrix backplanes driving micro-LEDs using OTFT at high

brightness (>100,000 nits). We have sought patent protection for our processes. In addition, the Company has successfully integrated OTFT and OLED (AMOLED) in a 200ppi display. 
​
We are a member of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Solid State Lighting and Energy Electronics Centre (SSLEEC) which is conducting innovative research into the development of micro-LED displays. As a member of the SSLEEC we have the right to obtain access to technologies and intellectual property developed by the Center in technology fields such as micro-LEDs and displays. In 2023, we obtained exclusive rights to a UCSB patent family related to Micro-LEDs.
​
Intellectual Property 
 ​
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our active organic semiconductors, formulated OSC and passive dielectric interlayer inks, processes and know-how that collectively comprise our TRUFLEX® technology, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Over the past 10 years, we have been building and are continuing to build the intellectual property portfolio relating to our TRUFLEX® technology. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
 ​
Our strategy for the protection of our proprietary technology is to file international (Patent Cooperation Treaty) patent applications and pursue these in national jurisdictions that represent significant market opportunities. However, we assess on a case-by-case basis whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain trade secret protection for our inventions and “know-how” rather than pursue patent protection the latter of which documents will ultimately be in the public domain. Generally, patents have a term of twenty years from the earliest priority date, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid, no portion of the patent has been terminally disclaimed, and the patent has not been invalidated. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended or reduced.
 ​
We believe that we are a technology leader in the design, development, and production of active and passive electronic materials for use in organic electronic applications. Excluding licensed-in IP, our patent portfolio comprises 19 patent families with 125 granted patents, 15 pending patents and 40 codified trade secrets. Our patents cover the active organic semiconductor materials, passive interlayer formulations, and deposition processes comprising our TRUFLEX® technology. We also have numerous patent claims and pending patent applications covering a variety of electronic devices including a novel dual gate application that enables enhanced Vto control and recent applications include Micro-LED devices and improved processes. Because our patent portfolio covers all material aspects of our TRUFLEX® technology, we believe we have strong protection for our technology and a competitive advantage over potential competitors who may seek to duplicate our ability to create flexible transistors.
 ​
We also rely on trade-secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information, and we typically use non-disclosure agreements when commencing a relationship with a potential customer or partner. We have an internal program to document our trade secrets for each major area of our technology and operations. We cannot be sure that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. The TRUFLEX® trademark is granted and registered to the Company in its 10 commercially interesting jurisdictions including USA, China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Europe.
 ​
We own substantive rights to the chemistry, process, and stack design rules necessary to implement our technology in all jurisdictions of commercial interest.

Manufacturing and Supply 
 ​
We obtain strategic intermediates and final products from multiple sources who produce our active semiconductor materials to our specifications. Our TRUFLEX® materials fall into two main categories, “active” organic semiconductor materials and “passive” interlayer materials. Our active materials generally require high levels of process and product control, and therefore these are synthesized from start to end by us or a third party that has met certain certification requirements and then formulated by us into the organic semiconductor inks. We validate active components internally before use. Our passive interlayers inks use a range of commercially available intermediates, formulated to our specifications to meet differing end-use performance parameters depending on the intended use. Our active and passive inks are proprietary to us.
 ​
We synthesize the active materials either internally or using third-party suppliers that meet specific certification requirements. The raw materials used to produce the formulated passive interlayers are purchased from multiple suppliers and tested and validated internally before use. The passive and active interlayer inks are presently manufactured internally in our formulation facility located in Manchester in the U.K. We are also evaluating a base layer material manufactured on a larger scale by a third-party contractor. Initial results have been promising and we are continuing our testing and evaluation.
 ​
We use our U.K.-based formulation activity to enable customers to validate our materials on their Gen1- Gen2.5 pilot lines. Our TRUFLEX® inks typically comprise between 1.2% up to 25% by weight of solids with the remainder being made up by electronic grade solvents. For commercial supply quantities, to avoid the shipping costs associated with large quantities of locally available solvents, we expect to supply fully formulated ink to customers from a formulation facility located close to the customer’s manufacturing facility. We may also outsource the ink manufacture to an accredited third-party local formulator subject to our final QC testing of the formulated inks.
 ​
We have not experienced any supply shortages with respect to the materials used to formulate our proprietary inks. In addition, we have not experienced scheduling delays in obtaining access to CPI’s foundry equipment.
​
To date, our manufacturing and supply operations have not been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we may be impacted in the future as we seek to expand our operations and enter into foundry arrangements with third-party manufacturers.
 ​
CPI Agreement 
 ​
We perform prototyping with our own employees using foundry equipment made available to us by CPI. We use the CPI facility to produce test samples for internal evaluation and for the supply of demonstrators to potential customers and for general market development. CPI is funded through a combination of U.K. government grants, collaborative research and development projects funded by the private and public sector and contracts funded by businesses. CPI provides services to companies engaged in translating ideas and inventions into commercially successful products and processes. It operates seven national facilities in the Northeast of England and Scotland and provides industry relevant expertise and assets to its customers.
 ​
We have entered into a framework services agreement with CPI Innovation Services Limited (“CPIIS”), the management company for CPI, pursuant to which we purchase services consisting primarily of access to CPI process equipment required for fabrication as well as access to CPI staff with specific skills, to the extent required, at specified costs, including a minimum annual spending requirement. We have 18 employees at the CPI facility who operate or support operations and OTFT developments using the CPI equipment on our behalf. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, we utilize an online booking system to book usage of equipment for immediate use, subject to availability. For critical equipment that other CPI customers may seek to use, we may book up to two weeks in advance to guarantee availability. CPIL has agreed to use its reasonable commercial endeavors to supply the requested services.
 ​
The latest agreement with CPIIS became effective upon the Closing and has a fixed term of three years. The agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a breach by the other party. We also lease office space at CPI’s facility in Sedgefield, England.

​
Competition 
 ​
We believe that competition in our targeted markets is based on a variety of factors, including capability, functionality, performance, reliability, ease of use and ability to supply in sufficient quantities. We believe we can, or will be able to, compete effectively based on these factors.
 ​
a-Si technology is an inorganic process widely used in the manufacture of backplanes for LCDs. More recent developments in inorganic semiconductors include use of the metal oxide IGZO for backplanes for large area OLED TVs and LTPS for high resolution cell phones. All these inorganic processes are operated at high temperatures and therefore require high-cost substrates, especially if they are to be processed on plastic. We believe that integration of TFTs with temperature sensitive devices will be made easier with our OTFT inks due to their lower temperature requirements. In addition, we believe all inorganic TFT based active-matrix technologies face challenges in bending compared with organic TFTs resulting in higher manufacturing costs.
 ​
A number of competitors have engaged in the development of organic inks. However, these competitors either opt to use polymeric semiconductors (BASF SE, Merck KGaA and Sumitomo Chemical Co., Ltd.) that process well but have a lower mobility than the polycrystalline organic materials in our TRUFLEX® materials, or polycrystalline semiconductors that have high mobility but relatively poor uniformity when processed. We believe our proprietary technology, which combines a polycrystalline molecule with a matched semiconducting polymer, provides higher mobility and better processability over these technologies.

Many of our potential competitors could have substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, broader and deeper product portfolios, larger customer bases, substantially greater financial and other resources, and larger scale manufacturing operations. However, we believe our products have the potential to compete with many of our competitors’ offerings through product performance, product reliability and satisfaction of customer qualifications and standards.
 ​
Government Regulation
 ​
In addition to customer specific requirements for safety health and the environment, our formulated materials also may be subject to government regulation during their use in the country of device manufacture and from regulations covering the materials in the finished device. These could include the toxicity (potential for Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, and Teratogenicity) and restrictions from the Environmental Protection Agencies in the countries of manufacture.
 ​
All new chemicals we obtain are evaluated at the time of order and a Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (“COSHH”) assessment is performed prior to commencement of any practical work with these materials. The COSHH assessment considers chemical hazards associated with the material, its physical properties, the scale of the planned work and the nature of that work e.g., temperature and containment. This process provides the first opportunity to screen out any materials that may be prohibited by the ultimate customer. Any use of material in Health and Safety Executive COSHH hazard category E, all but gram scale uses of non-volatile material in hazard category D and use of material in hazard category C in quantities of more than 1kg would trigger a management review. While it is possible that management authorization may be given to conduct research using materials in categories D & E, their use in a potentially formulated product would be discouraged and an alternative sought at an early stage. Materials are also screened against lists of banned and restricted materials provided by display manufacturers. Any material present on the display manufacturers banned list would not be used in formulated product.
 ​
We work with a third-party service provider to create safety data sheets for our formulated products that are shipped to customers and other end users. Our formulated products contain no materials that are restricted in the U.K. and no permissions or exemptions are required.

Our OGI material is fluorinated and spun from a fluorosolvent listed under regulation (EC) No 428/2009 of 5 May 2009 under section 1C006d. Export of formulations may require a Standard individual export license to be applied for and end use declaration made by the customer. These can be obtained through the U.K.’s SPIRE system.
 ​
To the extent our products are or become subject to U.K. export controls and regulations, these regulations may limit the export of our products and technology, and provision of our services outside of the U.K., or may require export authorizations, including by license, a license exception, or other appropriate government authorizations and conditions, including annual or semi-annual reporting. Export control and economic sanctions laws may also include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain of our products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons, and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the importation of certain products, through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products. The exportation, re-exportation, and importation of our products and technology and the provision of services, including by our partners, must comply with these laws or else we may be adversely affected, through reputational harm, government investigations, penalties, and a denial or curtailment of our ability to export our products and technology. Complying with export control and sanctions laws may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Although we take precautions to prevent our products and technology from being provided in violation of such laws, our products and technology may have previously been, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. If we are found to be in violation of U.K. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for the individuals working for us. Export or import laws or sanctions policies are subject to rapid change and have been the subject of recent U.K. and non-U.K. government actions. Changes in export or import laws or sanctions policies, may adversely impact our operations, delay the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products and technology to certain countries, regions, governments, persons, or entities altogether, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
