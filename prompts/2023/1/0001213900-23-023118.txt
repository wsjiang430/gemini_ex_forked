ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



Zion Oil and Gas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an oil and gas exploration company with a history of 23 years of oil and gas exploration in Israel. We were incorporated in Florida on April 6, 2000 and reincorporated in Delaware on July 9, 2003. We completed our initial public offering in January 2007. Our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”) currently trades on the OTCQX marketplace of OTC Markets, Inc. under the symbol “ZNOG” and our Common Stock warrant under the symbol “ZNOGW.”



The Megiddo Jezreel License 401 was awarded on December 3, 2013, for a three year primary term through December 2, 2016, with the possibility of up to four one-year extensions up to a maximum of seven years to December 3, 2020. 



The Megiddo Jezreel #1 (“MJ-01”, “MJ-1” or “MJ #1”) pad site was completed in early March 2017, after which the drilling rig and associated equipment were mobilized to the site. Performance and endurance tests were completed, and the MJ #1 exploratory well was spud on June 5, 2017 and drilled to a total depth (“TD”) of 5,060 meters (approximately 16,600 feet). Thereafter, the Company obtained three open-hole wireline log suites (including a formation image log), and the well was successfully cased and cemented. The Ministry of Energy approved the well testing protocol on April 29, 2018.



During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company testing protocol was concluded at the MJ #1 well. The test results confirmed that the MJ #1 well did not contain hydrocarbons in commercial quantities in the zones tested. As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to its unproved oil and gas properties of $30,906,000.



While the MJ #1 well was not commercially viable, Zion learned a great deal from the drilling and testing of this well. We believed that the drilling and testing of this well carried out the testing objectives which would support further evaluation and potential further exploration efforts within our License area. Zion believed it was prudent and consistent with good industry practice to examine further these questions with a focused 3-D seismic imaging shoot of approximately 72 square kilometers surrounding the MJ#1 well. Zion completed all of the acquisition, processing and interpretation of the 3-D data and incorporated its expanded knowledge base into the drilling of our Megiddo Jezreel #2 (“MJ-02”, “MJ-2” or “MJ #2”) exploratory well.



On March 12, 2020, Zion entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Central European Drilling kft, a Hungarian corporation, to purchase an onshore oil and gas drilling rig, drilling pipe, related equipment and spare parts for a purchase price of $5.6 million in cash, subject to acceptance testing and potential downward adjustment. We remitted to the Seller $250,000 on February 6, 2020 as earnest money towards the Purchase Price. The Closing anticipated by the Agreement took place on March 12, 2020 by the Seller’s execution and delivery of a Bill of Sale to us. On March 13, 2020, the Seller retained the earnest money deposit, and the Company remitted $4,350,000 to the seller towards the purchase price, and $1,000,000 (the “Holdback Amount”) was deposited in escrow with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company LLC. On January 6, 2021, Zion completed its acceptance testing of the I-35 drilling rig and the Holdback Amount was remitted to Central European Drilling.



The New Megiddo License 428 (“NML 428”) was awarded on December 3, 2020 for a six-month term with the possibility of an additional six-month extension. On April 29, 2021, Zion submitted a request to the Ministry of Energy for a six-month extension to December 2, 2021. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Energy approved our request for extension to December 2, 2021. On November 29, 2021, the Ministry of Energy approved our request for extension to August 1, 2022. On July 25, 2022, Zion submitted a request to the Ministry of Energy for a six-month extension to February 1, 2023. On July 31, 2022, the Ministry of Energy approved our request for extension to February 1, 2023. The NML 428 expired on February 1, 2023, but the Company applied for a replacement license prior to such expiration. At the time of the filing of this Annual Report, this replacement license is pending.



The MJ-2 drilling plan had been approved by the Ministry of Energy on July 29, 2020. On January 6, 2021, Zion officially spudded its MJ-02 exploratory well. On November 23, 2021, Zion announced via a press release that it completed drilling the MJ-02 well to a total depth of 5,531 meters (~18,141 feet) with a 6-inch open hole at that depth.



A full set of detailed and comprehensive tests including neutron-density, sonic, gamma, and resistivity logs were acquired in December 2021, as a result of which we identified encouraging zones of interest.

During the third quarter of 2022, Zion perforated and stimulated two deep zones.



On October 3, 2022, Zion sent a database email update to its supporters announcing the following: (1) We were encouraged by the results of our recent testing operations, especially the lower zone (approximately 20 meters in thickness), which was our primary zone of interest, (2) we were facing a downhole obstacle in the form of heavy water influx from the upper zone inhibiting the potential flow of hydrocarbons from the lower zone and (3) after consultation with outside experts, we planned to isolate and neutralize the heavy water influx by procuring a 4.5” packer and installing it below the heavy water zone and above our primary zone.



Zion suspended its operations at the MJ-02 pad site during October 2022 due to several Jewish holidays during the month. Beginning in early November 2022, Zion resumed its testing operations after procuring the necessary equipment and personnel.



On December 9, 2022, Zion sent a database email update to its supporters announcing the following: (1) after a thorough analysis of the results by Zion and third party experts, Zion determined that the well will not currently produce hydrocarbons in commercial quantities, (2) although logs strongly indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, we have determined the zone does not have sufficient permeability to be productive, (3) we will set a temporary plug in the wellbore to preserve its integrity and the opportunity to make future use of it, should circumstances and technological innovations warrant that, (4) based on what we learned about the characteristics of this deep Mohilla zone in the MJ-2 well, we are aggressively re-analyzing our logs and other data from the MJ-1 well, which was drilled on the same pad site. Knowing this zone is structurally higher than the equivalent zone in MJ-2, we are diligently evaluating whether this zone was adequately tested in the MJ-1 well, (5) once we have completed that analysis, we may re-enter the MJ-1 wellbore, which is cased to the bottom, and attempt a re-completion in the Mohilla zones, and (6) we will continue to explore the Megiddo-Jezreel license area as we are confident that we are in an active petroleum system.



As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge to its unproved oil and gas properties of $45,615,000. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company did not record any non-cash impairment charge.



Zion Oil & Gas, Inc. filed an amended application with the Israel Ministry of Energy for a new exploratory license on January 24, 2023 covering the same area as its License No. 428, which expired on February 1, 2023. However, its original application to replace License No. 428 was filed on May 11, 2022, and a revised application was filed on August 29, 2022.



With a third parliamentary election in Israel since March 2, 2020, on November 1, 2022, review of Zion’s new license application was delayed. After the election, an ongoing transition period has taken place. A new Minister of Energy took office on January 1, 2023 and appointed a new Director General of the Ministry.



As previously reported, Zion has re-examined the logs and other data from its MJ-01 well in preparation for a planned re-entry. Zion’s license application was therefore amended to address the planned re-entry, requiring a change in the workplan portion of the application, and then re-submitted on January 24, 2023.



Since May of 2022, Zion has worked closely with all the necessary Ministry officials to address questions and resolve any issues raised by its application. Zion therefore believes it has met all of the preliminary license requirements. Although no assurances can be made, Zion anticipates its license application will be favorably considered by the Ministry and other necessary regulatory agencies.



In the interim, Zion plans to leave its I-35 drilling rig and all related components on its current pad site and perform necessary rig maintenance, engineering and design for the planned re-entry.

At present, we have no revenues or operating income. Our ability to generate future revenues and operating cash flow will depend on the successful exploration and exploitation of any future petroleum rights or the acquisition of oil and/or gas producing properties, and the volume and timing of such production. In addition, even if we are successful in producing oil and gas in commercial quantities, our results will depend upon commodity prices for oil and gas, as well as operating expenses including taxes and royalties.



Our executive offices are located at 12655 North Central Expressway, Suite 1000, Dallas, Texas 75243, and our telephone number is (214) 221-4610. Our branch office’s address in Israel is 9 Halamish Street, North Industrial Park, Caesarea 3088900, and the telephone number is +972-4-623-8500. Our website address is: www.zionoil.com.



Company Background



In 1983, during a visit to Israel, John M. Brown (our CEO, Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors) became inspired and dedicated to finding oil and gas in Israel. During the next 17 years he made several trips each year to Israel, hired oil and gas consultants in Israel and Texas, met with Israeli government officials, made direct investments with local exploration companies, and assisted Israeli exploration companies in raising money for oil and gas exploration in Israel. This activity led Mr. Brown to form Zion Oil & Gas, Inc. in April 2000, in order to receive the award of a small onshore petroleum license from the Israeli government.



Zion’s vision, as guided by John Brown, of finding oil and/or natural gas in Israel, is biblically inspired. The vision is based, in part, on biblical references alluding to the presence of oil and/or natural gas in territories within the State of Israel that were formerly within certain ancient biblical tribal areas. While John Brown provides the broad vision and goals for our company, the actions taken by the Zion Board of Directors and management team as it actively explores for oil and gas in Israel, are based on modern science and good business practice. Zion’s oil and gas exploration activities are supported by appropriate geological, geophysical and other science-based studies and surveys typically carried out by companies engaged in oil and gas exploration activities.



Upon the award of our first petroleum right in May 2000, the Israeli government provided us access to most of its data with respect to previous exploration in the area, including geologic reports, seismic records and profiles, drilling reports, well files, gravity surveys, geochemical surveys and regional maps. We also gathered information concerning prior and ongoing geological, geophysical and drilling activity relevant to our planned activities from a variety of publicly accessible sources. Subsequently, we have acquired additional studies on our own such as seismic and other geophysical and geological surveys.



ZION’S PROSPECTIVE LICENSE AREA



The Company held one active petroleum exploration license onshore Israel, the NML 428, comprising approximately 99,000 acres – See Map 1. Under Israeli law, Zion had an exclusive right to oil and gas exploration in our license area in that no other company may drill there. In the event we drilled an oil or gas discovery in our license area, current Israeli law entitles us to convert the relevant portions of our license to a 30-year production lease, extendable to 50 years, subject to compliance with a field development work program and production.



The NML 428 was awarded on December 3, 2020 for a six-month term with the possibility of an additional six-month extension. On April 29, 2021, Zion submitted a request to the Ministry of Energy for a six-month extension to December 2, 2021. On May 30, 2021, the Ministry of Energy approved our request for extension to December 2, 2021. On November 29, 2021, the Ministry of Energy approved our request for extension to August 1, 2022. On July 25, 2022, Zion submitted a request to the Ministry of Energy for a six-month extension to February 1, 2023. On July 31, 2022, the Ministry of Energy approved our request for extension to February 1, 2023. The NML 428 expired on February 1, 2023, but Zion applied for a replacement license prior to such expiration, which is pending.



The NML 428 lies onshore, south and west of the Sea of Galilee and we continue our exploration focus here based on our studies, as it appears to possess the key geologic ingredients of an active petroleum system with significant exploration potential.

Zion’s Former Joseph License



Zion has plugged all of its exploratory wells on its former Joseph License area, and the reserve pits have been evacuated, but acknowledges its obligation to complete the abandonment of these well sites in accordance with guidance from the Energy Ministry, Environmental Ministry and local officials.

Employees & Contractors



As of December 31, 2022, we had 23 employees and contractors of whom all but two are on a full-time basis. Included in this number are certain contractors who provide services to Zion on an ongoing basis. Of the 23 total headcount, 17 work out of our Dallas office and 6 work out of the Caesarea, Israel office. None of our current employees or contractors are subject to any collective bargaining agreements, and there have been no strikes.



We regularly utilize independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, particularly for services connected to drilling operations, such as specialized drilling, health and safety, engineering, logging, cementing and well-testing.



Competition and Markets



The oil and gas exploration industry in Israel currently consists of a number of exploration companies. These include relatively small local or foreign companies (such as Zion Oil & Gas, Givot Olam, and Globe Exploration), as well as larger consortia of local Israeli and foreign participants (Noble Energy Inc./Delek Group Ltd.). Most groups are engaged primarily in offshore activities, which is not an area in which we are currently active. Israeli law conveys an exclusive exploration right to license holders such that no additional companies may compete in that license area.



Historically, Israel (particularly onshore) has not been an area of interest for international integrated or large or mid-size independent oil and gas exploration companies for various reasons, one of which is likely geopolitical. Since the announcement of the Tamar and Leviathan discoveries during 2009 and 2010, this situation has changed somewhat. Limited availability in Israel of oil field service companies, equipment and personnel continues to present obstacles, especially during periods of decreased activity and risk aversion in the current market. We attempt to enhance our position by developing and maintaining good professional relations with oil field service providers and by demonstrating a high level of credibility in making and meeting commercial commitments.



The oil and gas industry is cyclical, and from time to time there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies can vary greatly. If the unavailability or high cost of drilling and completion rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel was particularly severe in the areas where we operate, we could be materially and adversely affected. We will continue to monitor the market and build service provider relationships in order to help mitigate concentration risk.



If any exploratory well that we drill is commercially productive, we would install the appropriate production equipment which includes, among other items, oil and gas separation facilities and storage tanks. Under the terms of the Petroleum Law, we may be required by the Minister of Energy and Water Resources to offer first refusal for any oil and gas discovered to Israeli domestic purchasers at market prices.



Since Israel imports almost all of its crude oil needs and the market for crude oil in Israel is limited to two local oil refineries, no special marketing strategy needs to be adopted initially with regard to any oil that we may ultimately discover. We believe that we would have a ready local market for our oil at market prices in addition to having the option of exporting to the international market, if any of our future exploratory wells are commercially productive.



Israel’s Petroleum Law



Our business in Israel is subject to regulation by the State of Israel under the Petroleum Law. The administration and implementation of the Petroleum Law are vested in the Minister of Energy (“Energy Minister”), the Petroleum Commissioner and an advisory council. The following discussion includes a brief summary of certain provisions of the Petroleum Law as currently in effect. This review is not complete, and it should not be relied on as a definitive restatement of the law related to petroleum exploration and production activities in Israel.



Petroleum resources are owned by the State of Israel, regardless of whether they are located on state lands or the offshore continental shelf. No person is allowed to explore for or produce petroleum without being granted a specific right under the Petroleum Law. Israeli law provides for three types of rights, two relevant to the exploration stage and the third for the production stage.





7







Preliminary permit. The “preliminary permit” allows a prospector to conduct preliminary investigations, such as field geology, airborne magnetometer surveys and seismic data acquisition, but does not allow test drilling. It may be granted for a period not to exceed 18 months. The holder of a preliminary permit is entitled to request a priority right on the permit area, which, if granted, prevents an award of petroleum rights on the permit area to any other party. There are no restrictions as to size of the permit area or to the number of permits that may be held by one prospector. However, Israeli policy is to award an area no larger than that for which the applicant has a reasonable plan of operation and has shown evidence of the necessary financial resources to execute the plan.



License. The next level of petroleum right is the “license,” bestowing an exclusive right for further exploration work and requiring the drilling of one or more test wells. The initial term of a license is up to three years, and it may be extended for up to an additional four years (in one-year increments). In the event of a discovery, the license may be extended for an additional two years. A license area may not exceed 400,000 dunams (approximately 98,842 acres). One dunam is equal to 1,000 square meters (approximately 0.24711 of an acre). No one entity may hold more than 12 licenses or hold more than a total of four million dunam in aggregate license area.



Production lease. Upon discovery of petroleum in commercial quantities, a licensee has a statutory “right” to receive a production “lease.” The initial lease term is 30 years, extendable for an additional 20 years (up to a maximum period of 50 years). A lease confers upon the lessee the exclusive right to explore for and produce petroleum in the lease area and requires the lessee to produce petroleum in commercial quantities (and pursue test and development drilling). The lessee is entitled to transport and market the petroleum produced, subject, however, to the right of the government to require the lessee to supply local needs first, at market price.



Petroleum rights fees. The holders of licenses and leases are required to pay fees to the government of Israel to maintain the rights. The fees vary according to the nature of the right, the size and location (onshore or offshore) of the right, acreage subject to the right and, in the case of a license, the period during which the license has been maintained.



Requirements and entitlements of holders of petroleum rights. The holder of a petroleum right (license or lease) is required to conduct its operations in accordance with a work program set as part of the petroleum right, with due diligence and in accordance with the accepted practice in the petroleum industry. The holder is required to submit progress and final reports; provided, however, the information disclosed in such reports remains confidential for as long as the holder owns a petroleum right on the area concerned.



If the holder of a petroleum right does not comply with the work program provided by the terms of the right, the Petroleum Commissioner may issue a notice requiring that the holder cure the default within 60 days of the giving of the notice, together with a warning that failure to comply within the 60-day cure period may entail cancellation of the right. If the petroleum right is cancelled following such notice, the holder of the right may, within 30 days of the date of notice of the Commissioner’s decision, appeal such cancellation to the Energy Minister. No petroleum right shall be cancelled until the Energy Minister has ruled on the appeal.



We are obligated, according to the Petroleum Law, to pay royalties to the Government of Israel on the gross production of oil and gas from the oil and gas properties of Zion located in Israel (excluding those reserves serving to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities). The royalty rate stated in the Petroleum Law is 12.5% of the produced reserves. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any outstanding obligation with respect to royalty payments, since it is in the development stage and, to this date, no proved reserves have been found.

In March 2011, the Israeli parliament enacted the Petroleum Profits Taxation Law, 2011, which imposes a new levy on oil and gas production. Under the new tax regime, the Israeli Government repealed the percentage depletion deduction and imposed a levy at an initial rate of 20% on profits from oil and gas which will gradually rise to 45.52% for 2016 onwards, depending on the levy coefficient (the R-Factor). The R-Factor refers to the percentage of the amount invested in the exploration, the development and the establishment of the project, so that the 20% rate will be imposed only after a recovery of 150% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 1.5) and will range linearly up to 45.52% after a recovery of 230% of the amount invested (R-Factor of 2.3). For purposes of the levy rate calculation, the minimal gas sale price that will be accepted by the State is the bi-annual average local price. The present 12.5% royalty imposed on oil revenues remains unchanged.



The grant of a petroleum right does not automatically entitle its holder to enter upon the land to which the right applies or to carry out exploration and production work thereon. Entry requires the consent of the private or public holders of the surface rights and of other public regulatory bodies (e.g. planning and building authorities, Nature Reserves Authority, municipal and security authorities, etc.). The holder of a petroleum right may request the government to acquire, on its behalf, land needed for petroleum purposes. The petroleum right holder is required to obtain all other necessary approvals.



Petroleum Taxation. Our activities in Israel will be subject to taxation both in Israel and in the United States. Under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, we will be entitled to claim either a deduction or a foreign tax credit with respect to Israeli income taxes paid or incurred on our Israeli source oil and gas income. As a general rule, we anticipate that it will be more advantageous for us to claim a credit rather than a deduction for applicable Israeli income taxes on our U.S tax return. A tax treaty exists between the U.S. and Israel that would provide opportunity to use the tax credit.



Exploration and development expenses. Under current US and Israeli tax laws, exploration and development expenses incurred by a holder of a petroleum right can, at the option of such holder, either be expensed in the year incurred or capitalized and expensed (or amortized) over a period of years. Most of our expenses to date have been expensed for both U.S. and Israeli income tax purposes.



Depletion allowances. Until 2011, the holder of an interest in a petroleum license or lease was allowed a deduction for income tax purposes on account of the depletion of the petroleum reserve relating to such interest. This may have been by way of percentage depletion or cost depletion, whichever is greater. In 2010, the Finance Minister of Israel established an advisory committee to study the country’s fiscal policy as it relates to the upstream oil and natural gas sector, as well as various options, including an increase in royalties or cancellation of tax incentives. In January 2011, the Finance Ministry advisory committee issued its final recommendations which included cancellation of currently existing tax incentives, including the depletion allowance. In 2011, the depletion allowance was abolished.



Corporate tax. Under current Israeli tax laws, whether a company is registered in Israel or is a foreign company operating in Israel through a branch, it is subject to Israeli Companies Tax on its taxable income (including capital gains) from Israeli sources at a flat rate of 23%, effective January 1, 2019.



Import duties. Insofar as similar items are not available in Israel, the Petroleum Law provides that the owner of a petroleum right may import into Israel, free of most customs, purchase taxes and other import duties, all machinery, equipment, installations, fuel, structures, transport facilities, etc. (apart from consumer goods and private cars and similar vehicles) that are required for the petroleum exploration and production purposes, subject to the requirement that security be provided to ensure that the equipment is exported out of Israel within the agreed upon time frame.



Israeli Energy Related Regulations



Our operations are subject to legal and regulatory oversight by energy-related ministries or other agencies of Israel, each having jurisdiction over certain relevant energy or hydrocarbons laws.
The Onshore Petroleum Exploration Permitting Process in Israel



The permitting process in Israel with respect to petroleum exploration continues to undergo significant modification, the result of which is to considerably increase the complexity, time period, and expenditures needed to obtain the necessary permits to undertake exploratory drilling once a drilling prospect has been identified. Applications for new exploration licenses need to comply with more demanding requirements relating to a license applicant’s financial capability, experience and access to experienced personnel. Various guidelines have been published in Israel by the State of Israel’s Petroleum Commissioner and Energy and Environmental Ministries since 2012 as it pertains to oil and gas activities. Mention of these guidelines was included in previous Zion Oil & Gas filings.

On June 2, 2020, the Energy Ministry issued a guidance document titled “Commissioner for Petroleum Affairs Guidelines: Extraordinary Incidences Report.” These guidelines describe the reporting procedure regarding incidences that are out of the ordinary during pre-drilling, drilling and production activities including incidences that cause bodily injury or damage to property or environment or incidences that are a cause of delay or cessation of drilling activities.



The Company believes that these new regulations are likely to result in an increase in the expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights and drilling new wells. The Company expects that an additional financial burden could occur as a result of requiring cash reserves that could otherwise be used for operational purposes. In addition, these new regulations are likely to continue to increase the time needed to obtain all of the necessary authorizations and approvals to drill and production test exploration wells.



Environmental & Safety / Planning & Building



Oil and gas drilling operations could potentially harm the environment if there are polluting spills caused by the loss of well control. The Petroleum Law and regulations provide that the conduct of petroleum exploration and drilling operations be pursued in compliance with “good oil field practices” and that measures of due care be taken to avoid seepage of oil, gas and well fluids into the ground and from one geologic formation to another. The Petroleum Law and regulations also require that, upon the abandonment of a well, it be adequately plugged and marked. Recently, as a condition for issuing the required permit for the construction of a drilling site, the planning commissions have required the submission of a site remediation plan, subject to approval of the environmental authorities. Our operations are also subject to claims for personal injury and property damage caused by the release of chemicals or petroleum substances by us or others in connection with the conduct of petroleum operations on our behalf. Various guidelines have been published in Israel by the State of Israel’s Petroleum Commissioner and Energy and Environmental Ministries since 2012 as it pertains to oil and gas activities. Mention of these guidelines was included in previous Zion Oil& Gas filings.



We do not know and cannot predict whether any new legislation in this area will be enacted and, if so, in what form and which of its provisions, if any, will relate to and affect our activities, how and to what extent or what impact, if any, it might have on our financial statements. There are no known proceedings instituted by governmental authorities, pending or known to be contemplated against us under any environmental laws. We are not aware of any events of noncompliance in our operations in connection with any environmental laws or regulations. However, we cannot predict whether any new or amended environmental laws or regulations introduced in the future will have a material adverse effect on our future business.



The Company believes that these new and/or revised regulations will significantly increase the complexity, time, and expenditures associated with obtaining new exploration rights, drilling, and plugging/abandoning new wells, coupled with the heavy financial burden of “locking away” significant amounts of cash that could otherwise be used for operational purposes.



Political Climate 



We are directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Specifically, we could be adversely affected by:




● | any major hostilities involving Israel;
--+----------------------------------------


● | the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a full or partial mobilization of the reserve forces of the Israeli army; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel.

Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and a state of hostility, varying from time to time in intensity and degree, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Any ongoing or future violence between Israel and the Palestinians, armed conflicts, terrorist activities, tension along Israel’s borders, or political instability in the region could possibly disrupt international trading activities in Israel and may materially and negatively affect our business conditions and could harm our prospects and business.



Civil unrest could spread throughout the region or grow in intensity, leading to more regime changes resulting in governments that are hostile to the United States and Israel, civil wars, or regional conflict. With ongoing operations by Iran, Syria, Russia, the U.S. and other countries in areas in close proximity to Israel, there is an increased risk of deliberate and/or inadvertent mishaps that could give rise to grave military and political consequences.



We cannot predict the effect, if any, on our business of renewed hostilities between Israel and its neighbors or any other changes in the political climate in the area.



Foundations 



If we are successful in finding and producing commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in Israel, 6% of our gross revenues from production will go to fund two charitable foundations that we established with the purpose of donating to charities in Israel, the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.



For charitable activities concerning Israel, the Bnei Joseph Foundation (R.A.) was established. On November 11, 2008, both the Articles of Association and Incorporation Certificate were certified by the Registrar of Amutot (i.e. Charitable Foundations) in Israel.



For the U.S. and worldwide charitable activities, the Abraham Foundation in Geneva, Switzerland was established. On June 20, 2008, the Articles of Incorporation were executed and filed by the Swiss Notary in the Commercial Registrar in Geneva. On June 23, 2008, the initial organizational meeting of the founding members was convened in Israel. Regulations for the Organization of the Abraham Foundation, signed by the founding members, were then filed with the Registrar. On November 19, 2008, the Swiss Confederation approved the Foundation as an international foundation under the supervision of the federal government. On December 8, 2008, the Republic of Geneva and the Federal government of Switzerland issued a tax ruling providing complete tax exemption for the Foundation.



Our shareholders, in a resolution passed at the 2002 Annual Meeting, gave authority to the Zion Board of Directors to transfer a 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the two foundations with regard to the Joseph and Asher-Menashe licenses. In accordance with that resolution, we took steps to legally convey or transfer a 3% overriding royalty interest to the Bnei Joseph Foundation (in Israel) and a 3% overriding royalty interest to the Abraham Foundation (in Switzerland).



On June 22, 2009, we received an official letter from the Commissioner informing us that the 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the Bnei Joseph Foundation and the Abraham Foundation had been registered in the Israeli Oil Register with regard to the Joseph and Asher-Menashe licenses. On November 9, 2011, we received an official letter from the Commissioner informing us that the 3% overriding royalty interest to each of the Bnei Joseph Foundation and the Abraham Foundation had been registered in the Israeli Oil Register with regard to the Jordan Valley License.



On February 5, 2014, the Company submitted applications to the Petroleum Commissioner, requesting royalty interest transfers from the Megiddo-Jezreel License 401 of 3% overriding royalties to the Bnei Joseph Amutot and the Abraham Foundation, respectively. On April 8, 2014, the transfers were approved by the Petroleum Commissioner and duly registered.



On January 14, 2021, the Company submitted applications to the Energy Ministry, Natural Resources Administration, requesting royalty interest transfers from the New Megiddo License 428 of 3% overriding royalties to each of the Bnei Joseph Amutot and the Abraham Foundation, respectively. On March 1, 2021, the Energy Ministry approved both transfers.
