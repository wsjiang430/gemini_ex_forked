Item 1. Business 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references to “we,” “our,” “us,” “Centessa,” “the Company,” and “our Company” refer to Centessa Pharmaceuticals plc and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company with a mission to discover, develop and ultimately deliver medicines that are transformational for patients. 
Our company was formed in October 2020 to pursue our mission within a unique, at-scale asset-centric operating model in a capital efficient manner. We refer to this concept as “asset-centricity.” On January 29, 2021, we acquired 11 pre-revenue, development stage biotechnology companies as direct subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Centessa Subsidiaries”), and in June 2021, we completed an initial public offering (“IPO”). Since early 2022, we have substantially changed how we manage the Centessa Subsidiaries, and where applicable, we have reorganized their assets into individual focused pipeline programs unified under the Centessa Pharmaceuticals corporate brand.
Our Operating Model 
As we continue to evolve our business, we believe our operating model is a competitive advantage that has the potential to advance our mission for the benefit of patients in need, further differentiate our Company, and drive value for our shareholders. 
Key aspects of our asset-centric model include:
A pipeline of high conviction assets in therapeutic areas of unmet need. Our current pipeline programs span early-stage to late-stage development and cover a range of high-value indications in areas of unmet patient need. Many of these programs were inspired by our team’s work in treating people living with these underlying diseases, and subsequently built on prior learnings in human genetics or precedented human activity for a pathway of interest. Subject to regulatory approval, we believe that multiple programs within our pipeline programs have the potential to change the current treatment paradigm, establish a new standard of care for patients, and compete in multi-billion dollar markets.
Our most advanced product candidate is SerpinPC, a subcutaneously administered novel inhibitor of activated protein C (“APC”) being developed as a potential treatment for hemophilia. SerpinPC has a novel mechanism of action (“MoA”) designed to prevent and reduce bleeds. To date, clinical data from our ongoing Phase 2a studies in hemophilia A (“HA”) and hemophilia B (“HB”) subjects has shown SerpinPC to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile, as well as evidence of sustained efficacy in patients with hemophilia, as measured by a reduction in the all-bleeds annualized bleed rates (“ABRs”). Based on these data, we believe SerpinPC has the potential to be a first-in-class subcutaneously administered therapy with a differentiated safety profile for individuals with hemophilia, subject to regulatory review and approval. We are now advancing the registrational program for SerpinPC in HB, which includes a set of studies with multiple components. PRESent-5, initiated in late 2022, is an observational feeder study to collect prospective observational data for minimum defined periods before switching to dosing subjects in the interventional studies planned for later this year. SerpinPC received Orphan Drug Designation for HB from the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in September 2022. While the initial focus of our ongoing clinical development program is HB, with and without inhibitors, we believe SerpinPC has the potential to treat all types of hemophilia regardless of severity or inhibitor status and it may also prevent bleeding associated with other bleeding disorders. We continue to assess registrational plans for HA. We own worldwide rights to SerpinPC.
Leveraging our proprietary LockBody® technology, we are also pioneering a novel approach to selectively drive potent effector function activity, such as CD47 or CD3, into the tumor micro environment (“TME”) while avoiding systemic toxicity. We have conducted in vivo preclinical studies of our LockBody technology with CD47 for the treatment of solid tumors. LB101, a conditionally tetravalent PD-L1xCD47 bi-specific monoclonal antibody, is our first LockBody product candidate. Following clearance of our Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application from the FDA in January 2023, we initiated a Phase 1/2a first-in-human, clinical trial of LB101 for the treatment of solid tumors and dosed the first subject in March 2023. We look to this study to provide validation to further advance LB101 and our LockBody technology platform. We plan to continue to invest in expanding our knowledge of our LockBody technology in order to 

identify and advance additional potential product candidates, including a conditionally bivalent PD-L1xCD3 bi-specific monoclonal antibody. We own worldwide rights to our LockBody platform, LB101 and potential future candidates.
Our other programs consist of earlier-stage preclinical assets including our newest product candidate, ORX750, an orally administered, selective Orexin Receptor-2 (“OX2R”) agonist for the treatment of narcolepsy (“NT1”) with potential expansion into other sleep disorders, and MGX292, a protein-engineered variant of human bone morphogenetic protein 9 (“BMP9”) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”). In addition, we have discovery-stage programs across certain other disease areas. 
We own worldwide rights to all of our pipeline programs. We may opportunistically evaluate and enter into strategic partnerships around certain product candidates, targets, geographies, or disease areas. 
An unshackled, data-driven, capital efficient drug discovery and development engine. At the core of our asset-centric model is a research and development (“R&D”) engine that aims to pursue the best assets in areas of unmet need, regardless of therapeutic area or technology. We manage our programs dynamically and have a disciplined, data-driven approach to determining which product candidates and programs to progress, including considering whether the potential product profile or most recent data meet our criteria to justify further investment. In particular, we apply various scientific, clinical and commercial criteria aggressively throughout the development of each program individually, and evaluate the merits of each program individually. In addition, our program decisions are not biased to therapeutic areas or technologies. We believe our unbiased, science-driven approach to each asset is not only a key differentiator for our company, but also supports the quality of our diversified pipeline programs. 
Equally important, our R&D model is designed toward rapidly progressing programs through development in a capital efficient manner. Research activities related to each of our programs are conducted through a Research Excellence Hub. Each Research Excellence Hub is dedicated to pursuing pathway and/or disease domain-specific research with the aim of bringing assets through candidate selection. Each is led by a subject matter expert based on their unique knowledge and expertise and is overseen by our Chief Innovation Officer (“CIO”). Once a candidate is selected, the program is transitioned to a development program team. The integrated one-team development structure brings together cross-functional expertise to drive agile, lean and effective clinical development of the asset. The development strategy is overseen by our Chairman of Development. 
The Research Excellence Hub and development program teams are designed to be lean, with limited fixed costs to further enhance the economics of asset-centric drug development. To accomplish this aim, the teams rely on strategic Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (“CDMO”) partners and consultants while maintaining a small, agile, and highly experienced core team of drug developers. Where appropriate, we also pursue opportunities for potentially rapid development, including orphan drug designation, fast track designation, and other regulatory and development avenues. 
Our R&D spend is consistent with our asset-centric approach, with the highest spend on the programs that have already established clinical proof of concept. For programs in the earlier stages, we aim to implement capital-efficient plans to reach the next set of catalysts, gating more significant spending until after we obtain clinical proof of concept. 
While we continue to refine aspects of our R&D model, we believe that this model enables a pipeline of high conviction assets. 
A highly skilled and experienced management team committed to asset-centricity. Our primary focus is to discover and develop a pipeline of high conviction assets in therapeutic areas of unmet need. We pursue a disciplined asset-centric approach to drug discovery and development and strive to advance our programs in a capital efficient manner. We are led by a management team with both subject matter expertise and extensive R&D experience from leading biotech and pharmaceutical companies. In addition, our program teams are comprised of both inventors of our assets and renowned leaders in their respective fields. Our extensive knowledge of both our assets and drug development informs our decision-making to advance the science and clinical path to demonstrate pharmacological activity and proof-of-concept, with the goal of achieving an efficient timeframe and cost-effective budget. We have a track record of making judicious capital and resource allocation decisions for discovery and development efforts across our portfolio, and expeditiously evaluating and terminating programs when the data do not support advancing a program. We believe this experience and our capabilities well positions us to identify and rapidly advance high value programs from research through all stages of development in a capital efficient manner.

Our Strategy 
Our mission is to discover, develop and ultimately deliver medicines that are transformational for patients. To achieve our mission, we are executing a near-term strategy focused on the following key elements:
•Rapidly advance the late-stage development of our most advanced product candidate, SerpinPC in hemophilia. We are now advancing the registrational program for SerpinPC in HB, which includes a set of studies with multiple components. PRESent-5, initiated in late 2022, is an observational feeder study to collect prospective observational data for minimum defined periods before switching to dosing subjects in the interventional studies planned for later this year. If the data from the registrational program are positive, we aim to submit a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), to the FDA as well as potential additional applications worldwide. While the initial focus of our ongoing clinical development program is HB, with and without inhibitors, we believe SerpinPC has the potential to treat all types of hemophilia regardless of severity or inhibitor status and it may also prevent bleeding associated with other bleeding disorders. We continue to assess registrational plans for HA. 
•Strategically invest in and advance our LockBody technology platform with LB101 and develop a pipeline of additional LockBody product candidates. We aim to continue to invest in expanding our knowledge of our LockBody novel pharmacology in order to advance LB101, our first LockBody candidate, for the treatment of solid tumors, and identify and progress additional LockBody candidates. Following clearance of our IND application from the FDA in January 2023, we initiated a Phase 1/2a first-in-human, clinical trial of LB101 for the treatment of solid tumors and dosed the first subject in March 2023. We look to this study to provide validation to further advance LB101 and our LockBody technology platform. For example, we are currently pursuing research internally to expand our LockBody technology to a conditionally bivalent PD-L1xCD3 bi-specific monoclonal antibody, which is designed to selectively drive potent CD3 effector function activity while minimizing the risk of systemic toxicity. The PD-L1xCD3 LockBody program is currently in lead optimization with the next anticipated milestone being selection of a product candidate later this year and the initiation of IND-enabling activities.
•Advance our pipeline of preclinical assets, including ORX750 in NT1 and other sleep disorders. We aim to continue progressing our earlier-stage development assets focused on high-value indications where there is unmet need. Consistent with our model, these assets are being progressed by focused teams led by renowned subject matter experts. In March 2023, we nominated our newest product candidate, ORX750, for the treatment of NT1 with potential expansion into other sleep disorders. ORX750 is in preclinical development and undergoing IND-enabling activities. We look forward sharing the candidate profile at a scientific meeting this year. In addition, we are developing MGX292, our product candidate for the treatment of PAH.
•Leverage our asset-centric drug discovery and development engine to continue building a pipeline of potential best or first-in-class product candidates. To continue growing our pipeline, we are investing heavily in our drug discovery and development efforts. We aim to continue to leverage our unique asset-centric R&D engine to discover and develop the best assets, regardless of therapeutic area or technology. In addition, we intend to continue making judicious capital and resource allocation decisions across our current and future portfolio, and expeditiously evaluating and potentially terminating programs when data do not support advancing a program. We continually explore appropriate and capital efficient ways to expand our pipeline and may pursue other opportunities, such as in-licensing assets that meet our selection criteria. 
•Evaluate opportunities to accelerate development timelines and enhance commercial potential of our programs in collaboration with third parties. We own full worldwide development and commercialization rights to each of our programs. In the future, we may selectively enter into collaborations where we believe there is a strategic fit or benefit or an opportunity to accelerate or expand the potential for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 
Our Pipeline Programs
The following table sets forth our pipeline programs, disease area, mechanism of action, and stage of development. In addition, we have discovery-stage programs across other disease areas. Where applicable, we provide updates on our programs as they enter clinical studies. 

Figure 1: Centessa pipeline programs.
Applying our data-driven decision making, in 2022 we took a number of actions with respect to our pipeline programs, (1) we discontinued the development of lixivaptan in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (“ADPKD”); ZF874 in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (“AATD”), a dual-STAT3/5 degrader program in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”), and all programs associated with PearlRiver including the small molecule epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) Exon20 insertion mutation inhibitor program and the C797S mutation inhibitor program for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (“NSCLC”); (2) we divested PearlRiver in December 2022; and (3) we evaluated strategic options for imgatuzumab, an anti-EGFR mAb; and subsequently divested this program in early January 2023 through a company divestment of Pega-One. Additionally, in December 2022, as a result of protocol defined stopping criterion having been met, we suspended dosing in the multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) stage of the Phase 1 study of CBS001, a neutralizing therapeutic mAb to the inflammatory membrane form of LIGHT for inflammatory / fibrotic diseases. We recently determined to deprioritize CBS001 and have paused all development activities pending strategic review. We are evaluating strategic partnerships to progress CBS004, a therapeutic mAb targeting BDCA-2 for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases, into the clinic. 
SerpinPC in Hemophilia 
We are developing our most advanced product candidate, SerpinPC, for the treatment of hemophilia. We are advancing the registrational program for SerpinPC in HB, which includes a set of studies with multiple components. PRESent-5, initiated in late 2022, is an observational feeder study to collect prospective observational data for minimum defined periods before switching to dosing subjects in the interventional studies planned for this year, and we continue to assess registrational plans for HA. 
Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder that is caused by a deficiency of a coagulation factor which results in inadequate thrombin generation upon vascular damage. HA and HB are X-linked genetic disorders affecting one in 5,000 and one in 20,000 live male births, respectively, resulting in spontaneous internal bleeding that can be life-threatening. More than 70% of bleeds occur into joints (hemarthrosis) causing chronic joint damage (arthropathy) with musculoskeletal destruction. Estimates of the global prevalence of HA and HB vary between 400,000 and 450,000. 
The bleeding associated with these disorders is the result of a defect or deficiency in factor (f)VIII (in the case of HA) or fIX (in the case of HB), the two components of the intrinsic tenase complex. Normal blood coagulation (hemostasis) is a crucial part of the physiological response to tissue damage. When blood components come into contact with extravascular cells and proteins, the resulting interaction of coagulation factors and platelets at a site of vascular injury leads to the formation of thrombin, the effector enzyme of blood coagulation. Prothrombinase activity is required for the rapid, localized production of thrombin needed for adequate hemostasis. Prothrombinase is continuously degraded by APC, an endogenous inhibitor of the clotting pathway which is generally present in the circulation at low concentrations. Under normal conditions, APC destroys prothrombinase extremely efficiently through catalytic activity; however, in the setting of deficient intrinsic tenase activity (hemophilia), the natural anticoagulant activity of the circulating APC results in insufficient prothrombinase activity for normal hemostasis.

Hemophilia is characterized as severe, moderate and mild, corresponding to <1%, 1% to 5% and >5% factor activity, respectively. Bleeding often becomes noticeable after a child becomes mobile. Hemarthrosis manifests as swelling and pain in the joints, along with decreased range of motion, most commonly affecting the knees, ankles and elbows. Other common manifestations include bruising, which can be spontaneous or occur after minor trauma, gum bleeding and nose bleeds. Persons with severe hemophilia often suffer spontaneous joint bleeds between 20 and 50 times a year. Spontaneous bleeding is less frequent in persons with moderate hemophilia, but in many individuals this condition is still problematic because the relative low frequency of bleeds does not warrant the treatment burden of regular intravenous (“IV”) prophylactic treatment with replacement factor yet as few as 2 or 3 bleeds into a joint are sufficient to cause permanent joint damage.
The global market for hemophilia is estimated at over $12 billion as of 2022. Only 20% of persons with hemophilia globally are believed to have access to adequate therapy.
The standard treatment for hemophilia consists of replacing the missing or defective fVIII or fIX by intravenous infusion of partially purified plasma-derived or recombinant fVIII or fIX protein, known as factor concentrate. Factor concentrate is administered either when bleeding occurs, known as on-demand therapy, or regularly to prevent bleeding, known as prophylaxis. Prophylaxis with standard factor concentrates requires intravenous infusion every second or third day in order to reduce annualized bleeding rates (“ABR”) below 10%. Less frequent intravenous infusion is required with recently approved extended half-life products. Emicizumab (marketed as HEMLIBRA® by Roche) is a synthetic fVIII mimetic replacement therapy that is changing the treatment paradigm in HA. The primary benefits of emicizumab are its use as a substitute for factor VIII in persons with HA with fVIII inhibitors (high-titer antibodies against fVIII), and as an infrequent subcutaneously administered prophylactic in HA without inhibitors. Emicizumab has no activity in HB. 
Because the replacement factor is effectively a foreign protein treatment, it is often associated with the formation of inhibitory antibodies which requires the use of a different class of therapeutics called bypass agents. Bypass agents increase thrombin generation through mechanisms independent of the intrinsic tenase complex. The most commonly used bypass agents are recombinant fVIIa and FEIBA. However, the use of these agents is limited by their short half-lives and result in variable responses in patients. They are also less effective than replacement therapy prior to the development of inhibitors and are rarely used prophylactically.
In addition to approved agents for the treatment of hemophilia that improve thrombin generation by bolstering the levels of procoagulant factors, the FDA has recently approved the first gene therapy for HB, HEMGENIX®, marketed by CSL Behring. Additional gene therapies currently being developed for HA include roctavian, by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (“BioMarin”), and giroctocogene fitelparvovec (SB-525) by Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”) and Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sangamo”). Although gene therapies could be a significant development for patients, they face uncertainty regarding safety, durability and cost and are specific to either HA and HB. We are also aware of several companies pursuing Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitors (“TFPIs”) for the treatment of hemophilia, including marstacimab being developed by Pfizer for HA and HB with and without inhibitors, and concizumab being developed by Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo Nordisk”) for HA and HB with inhibitors. RNAi therapeutic programs focused on HA and HB include fitusiran being developed by Sanofi. 
Despite advances in hemophilia treatment, there remains a considerable unmet need in both HA and HB:
•Factor concentrate therapies require intravenous administration making prophylaxis challenging;
•Up to 30% of persons with HA and 3% of persons with HB develop inhibitory antibodies to factor concentrates, which limits effectiveness of treatment with factor concentrates;
•The non-factor replacement therapies, both approved and in development, are associated with the risk of thrombosis; and
•The majority of persons with hemophilia have no or limited access to prophylactic treatment to prevent bleeding.
Our Product Candidate 
SerpinPC is an investigational, subcutaneously delivered biologic of the serpin family of proteins, designed to allow more thrombin to be generated by inhibiting activated protein APC. The MoA of SerpinPC is to reduce levels of circulating APC, thereby prolonging activity of prothrombinase formed during the initiation stage of hemostasis and directly increasing the amount of thrombin generated at the site of tissue damage.

Figure 2: Schematic of the MoA for SerpinPC. SerpinPC is designed to reduce levels of circulating APC (1), thereby prolonging activity of prothrombinase (2) and directly increasing the amount of thrombin generated (3) at the site of tissue damage.
As depicted in Figure 2, thrombin is the effector enzyme in blood coagulation, and is produced by an enzyme complex known as prothrombinase, composed of fXa and fVa. At the initiation stage of blood coagulation, the fXa is produced by the extrinsic tenase complex while the fVa is predominantly derived from platelets. This ‘early prothrombinase’ formation is preserved in hemophilia. However, extrinsic tenase activity is short-lived and early prothrombinase is inactivated by APC in the blood, so insufficient thrombin is produced to form a stable hemostatic clot, resulting in continued bleeding, unless more prothrombinase can be formed with the help of the intrinsic tenase complex. The two components of the intrinsic tenase complex are missing in HA and HB. SerpinPC treatment is designed to reduce the levels of APC so that the early prothrombinase has time to produce enough thrombin to form a stable hemostatic clot, thereby preventing excessive blood loss. 
SerpinPC is a variant of the serpin alpha-1-antitrypsin, modified to be a specific inhibitor of APC. We were able to convert A1AT into a specific inhibitor of APC by mutating 3 residues in the reactive center loop of the molecule. The serpin mechanism traps the protease during cleavage of the reactive center loop as a covalent complex, and therefore has an absolute requirement that the protease is active, i.e., not the inactive zymogen. For this reason, SerpinPC is designed to have complete specificity for APC over protein C (“PC”), and therefore is not expected to deplete the circulating concentration of PC (which could theoretically increase thrombotic risk). 
SerpinPC is designed as a long-acting non-replacement therapy intended to be administered as an infrequent injection under the skin that ‘rebalances’ blood coagulation without the need for factor replacement. It achieves this without depleting the natural anticoagulant pool of PC. As a result, we believe SerpinPC could be an attractive alternative therapy for many patients, if approved. Other rebalancing approaches have been plagued by the occurrence of venous and arterial thrombosis. Based on the totality of data from the SerpinPC clinical program, we believe that SerpinPC has a novel mechanism of action and differentiated pharmacological effect with a low thrombotic risk since (1) PC is not depleted, (2) the prothrombinase complex is not itself rendered resistant to APC, and (3) at clinical doses the slow rate of APC inhibition by SerpinPC leaves the ability of newly formed APC to degrade prothrombinase in the event of excess thrombin generation. We believe that the observed lack of treatment-related sustained elevations of D-dimer across our Phase 2a study (including the open-label extension (“OLE”)) in healthy volunteers and persons with hemophilia (“PwH”) support this profile. D-dimer is a sensitive measure of excessive thrombin generation.
The vialed drug product is presented as a sterile lyophilized powder intended for subcutaneous injection following reconstitution with water. Stability studies have shown the drug product to be stable at temperatures up to 40°C, and we expect a commercial product, if approved, will allow for ease of shipment and storage.
SerpinPC Registrational Program
In February 2022, we completed pre-IND interactions with the FDA for SerpinPC in HB. The FDA considered these to be very consistent with an end of Phase 2 meeting and based on the FDA feedback, we developed a streamlined, integrated registrational development plan for SerpinPC in HB named PRESent with fewer than 200 total subjects, including two planned Phase 2b interventional studies, PRESent-2 (moderately severe to severe HB without inhibitors, and severe HA with and without inhibitors) and PRESent-3 (HB with inhibitors), preceded by a non-interventional (i.e., observational) feeder study, PRESent-5. 

In September 2022, we received a “Study May Proceed Letter” from the FDA for the Phase 2b clinical studies under our IND application. Also, in September 2022, we announced that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to SerpinPC for the treatment of HB. In December 2022, we initiated PRESent-5 to begin collecting enough observational data for minimum defined periods of time before switching to dosing subjects in PRESent-2 or PRESent-3, which are planned for this year. In parallel and based on the FDA feedback, we continue to work with the FDA on our plans to accelerate product process development and qualification activities. This streamlined, integrated development program is designed to support marketing approval in adults and adolescents with HB, with and without inhibitors, as the initial indication. 
PRESent-2 (AP-0102): PRESent-2 is an interventional study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic SerpinPC in subjects with severe and moderately severe HB without inhibitors. In addition to HB subjects, the study will also enroll subjects with severe HA, with and without inhibitors, to add to the safety database. The study will have three parts: a 24-week randomized dose-justification part (Part 1) with approximately 60 subjects, a 24-week expansion part (Part 2) with approximately 60 further subjects at the dose selected from Part 1 based on an interim analysis, and a further 24-week extension part (Part 3) for subjects who complete either Part 1 or Part 2. The primary endpoint for PRESent-2 is the number of treated bleeds expressed as the all-bleeds ABR in the observation period and during Part 2 (24 weeks of treatment with SerpinPC) in subjects with HB previously receiving “on-demand” treatment. (See Figure 3 below.)
Figure 3: Registrational development program for SerpinPC (PRESent-2 Hemophilia B without inhibitors)
PRESent-3 (AP-0103): The objective of PRESent-3 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SerpinPC in subjects with severe HB with inhibitors. The study will have approximately 12 subjects who will receive 1.2 mg/kg of SerpinPC administered as a subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint for PRESent-3 is the number of treated bleeds expressed as the all-bleeds ABR in the observation period and during the 24 weeks of treatment with SerpinPC in subjects with HB with inhibitors. (See Figure 4 below.)
Figure 4: Registrational development program for SerpinPC (PRESent-3 Hemophilia B with inhibitors)
Although our Phase 2b interventional studies will include both HA and HB subjects, the initial focus of our registration efforts is HB, with and without inhibitors, given the higher unmet need and market opportunity in this patient population, who currently do not have subcutaneous prophylaxis alternative. We continue to assess registrational plans for HA.
SerpinPC Phase 1/2a (AP-0101) Study Results
 In December 2022 and February 2023, we reported results from both Part 3 and Part 4, the 18-month OLE of AP-0101, a first-in-human adaptive design open-label multi-center Phase 1/2a study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of subcutaneous doses of SerpinPC in healthy male volunteers and subjects with severe 

hemophilia (HA and HB) who were not on prophylaxis. In September 2021, we reported results from Part 1 and Part 2 of AP-0101. The results from Parts 1 to 4 are discussed below. Part 5 is ongoing. The design of AP-0101 is summarized in the graphic below.
Figure 5: Schematic representation of the Phase 1/2a (AP-0101) Study Design. 
(PwH is person with hemophilia)
The Phase 1 portion of this study was conducted in two parts, with Part 1a in healthy volunteers in a clinical trial unit in the U.K. In this part, four cohorts of healthy subjects received increasing doses of SerpinPC by IV infusion and one by subcutaneous injection. Part 1b was conducted in established clinical trial units embedded in university hospitals in Moldova and Georgia with access to the target patient population of persons with hemophilia ("PwH") receiving only on-demand factor concentrates provided by the national hemophilia treatment centers in the same hospitals. The SAD study informed dosing in Part 1b; PwH were dosed at a level at which biological effects might be expected, 0.1mg/kg to 1.2mg/kg by subcutaneous injection in four cohorts of three subjects each.
Part 1 Results
All doses in Part 1 were well-tolerated without incident or SerpinPC-related adverse events, including injection site reactions. Administration of SerpinPC did not lead to treatment- related increases in D-dimer, TNF or IL-6 at any dose.
All subjects in Part 1b had severe hemophilia and received factor concentrate on demand before and during the study. All patients had target joints at baseline (range 1 to 4, median 2.5). A baseline ABR was calculated for each subject from prospective observation prior to exposure to SerpinPC. The median ABR was 35 (range 26 to 41). In the 8 weeks following a single subcutaneous injection of SerpinPC there was a 55% reduction in all-bleeding and a 72% reduction in spontaneous joint and muscle bleeding. Five subjects experienced zero spontaneous bleeds for 2 months after receiving their single dose. In contrast a total of 97 bleeds occurred in the pre-exposure observation period and 29 in the 8 weeks following exposure. All 29 bleeds following SerpinPC administration were treated with factor concentrate on-demand as per standard of care without incident and without elevation in D-dimer levels. No anti-drug antibodies (“ADAs”) were detected in Part 1.
All subjects who participated in Part 1b of the Phase 1 study chose to enroll in Part 2 of the Phase 2a study. 
Part 2 Results
In September 2021, we announced positive top line results from Part 2, the six-month repeat dose portion of the Phase 2a study. Reduction in bleeding was an exploratory outcome. In total, 23 subjects enrolled in Part 2 of the Phase 2a study. One subject with a history of a skin disorder was discontinued because of an injection site reaction. 
•SerpinPC was well-tolerated. There were no other SerpinPC-related AEs observed throughout the 24-week study. 
•No thromboembolic events or treatment-related sustained elevations in D-dimer were observed throughout the 24-week study. 
•Two subjects had ADAs and remained on treatment without incident. 
•In the highest dose cohort (1.2 mg/kg of SerpinPC administered as a subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks for 24 weeks (n=8)), the self-reported all-bleeds ABR was reduced by 88% (from 36.0 median all-bleed ABR to 4.4) during the last 12 weeks of treatment (pre-specified primary assessment period) as compared to the 

all-bleeds ABR prospectively measured during the pre-exposure observation period. In the highest dose cohort, 5 out of 8 subjects had 1 or 0 bleeds during the 12-week pre-specified primary assessment period. Self-reported spontaneous joint bleeds ABR was reduced by 94% in the highest dose cohort (from 21.1 median spontaneous joint bleeds ABR to 2.2). ABR reductions were similar between patients with either HA or HB. 
Part 3 and Part 4 Results (18-Month OLE) 
All subjects who completed Part 2 elected to continue into the 18-month OLE of the Phase 2a study, which included Part 3 and Part 4. The OLE also includes Part 5, which is ongoing. We announced data from Part 3 and Part 4 in an oral presentation at the 64th American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting on December 10, 2022 and an oral presentation at the 16th Annual Congress of European Association for Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (“EAHAD”) on February 10, 2023. The results are discussed below. 
In Part 3, 22 subjects who completed Part 2 received a flat dose of 60 mg of SerpinPC administered as a subcutaneous injection once every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. One subject emigrated out of the site country and consequently discontinued treatment during Part 3. In Part 4, 21 subjects who completed Part 3 received 1.2 mg/kg of SerpinPC administered as a subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks for 24 weeks. One subject discontinued treatment during Part 4 following a cancer diagnosis which the Safety Review Group determined was not related to treatment with SerpinPC.
•SerpinPC was well-tolerated throughout the 18-month treatment period of the OLE. There were no SerpinPC-related adverse events and no thromboembolic events or treatment-related sustained elevations of D-dimer observed throughout the OLE period. (Detailed D-dimer results are shown in Figure 6 below.) There were no treatment-related discontinuations from the OLE.
•Overall, 2 of 22 (9.1%) subjects enrolled in Part 3 had sustained elevations of ADA (these are the same 2 subjects with ADA in Part 2). There were no adverse events observed related to these findings.
•At the highest dose tested (Part 4: 1.2 mg/kg of SerpinPC administered as a subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks for 24 weeks (n=21)), the median all-bleeds ABR was reduced by 93% as compared to the median all-bleeds ABR prospectively measured during the pre-exposure observation period. A median all-bleed ABR of 2.2 was achieved for all subjects in Part 4. 7 subjects had 0 bleeds during the 24-week period. The median spontaneous joint bleeds ABR was reduced by 93% as compared to the median spontaneous joint bleeds ABR prospectively measured during the pre-exposure observation period. A median spontaneous joint bleed ABR of 2.2 was achieved for all subjects in Part 4. 9 subjects had 0 spontaneous joint bleeds during the 24-week period.
•All breakthrough bleed events during the OLE period were successfully managed with the subject’s usual replacement factor without dose adjustment and did not require adjustments to SerpinPC dosing.

Our LockBody Technology Platform
We are developing a novel approach to selectively drive potent effector function activity, such as CD47 or CD3, into the TME while avoiding systemic toxicity by leveraging our proprietary LockBody technology platform. Our LockBody technology platform is designed to allow for the simplified and accelerated development of conditionally-active antibody drugs with the potential to engage powerful immune pathways in diseased tissue, but not in non-diseased tissue or the periphery, where the drug’s action is often unwanted. 
A ‘Locked’ LockBody
To prevent unwanted binding in the periphery, LockBody constructs utilize a “stacked Fabs” design, in which the traditional antibody structure is extended with the addition of a second Fab along each Heavy/Light chain pairing. These secondary, upper Fabs are designed to be constitutively active and bind to their targets as normal. These Fabs can be designed to target tumor targets that allow for enrichment of the LockBody into the TME. At the same time in the fully formed, ‘locked’ LockBody, these constitutive Fabs are designed to prevent binding, via steric occlusion, of the lower Fabs to their targets. The lower Fabs can then be designed to engage potent effector mechanisms, such as CD47 or CD3 with a lower risk of off-tumor toxicity in the periphery. 

Figure 8: In the ‘locked’ state a LockBody is designed to be stable in solution and not bind to the Contingent Fab target.
An ‘Unlocked’ LockBody
Prior research has demonstrated that native human IgG1, as well as various therapeutic antibodies, are vulnerable to cleavage in the TME at a specific location in their structure: the lower hinge. For native IgG and other therapeutic antibodies this represents a weakness: this cleavage reduces Fc receptor engagement and thus protects the tumor. However, by using variants of the lower hinge to connect the lower and upper Fabs of a LockBody, the LockBody is designed to exploit this cleavage in the tumor to create a beneficial effect. Once one of these connecting hinges is cleaved, by any one of a number of upregulated proteases, the lower Fab is designed to be unlocked and can engage with its target to drive potent effector function.
Figure 9: After unlocking, e.g. through incubation with TME-associated proteases, the complementarity-determining regions (“CDRs”) of the Contingent Fab are exposed and are designed to bind to their target.
We believe our LockBody technology platform has the following advantages compared to other therapeutic modalities:
•Our LockBody technology platform is designed to enable a potential dramatically enhanced therapeutic index. The unlocking of the full activity of a LockBody requires two criteria, the presence of the binding target of the constitutively-active, upper Fabs and a highly proteolytic environment. With the appropriate choice of tumor-associated antigen, we believe this dual requirement has the potential to significantly widen the therapeutic index and to provide access to the most potent effector mechanisms.
•Our LockBody technology platform is designed to avoid the ‘sink effect’. The stability of a ‘locked’ LockBody in the periphery is designed to prevent unwanted binding to effector targets that are often highly expressed in the blood and secondary lymphoid tissue. We believe this design has the potential to reduce the ‘sink effect’ and lead to much lower effective doses, which may further reduce the risk of toxicity.
•Our LockBody technology platform is based on a simple, IgG-based design that supports manufacturing by existing standard methods. As all the components of a LockBody are based on native, human IgG structures they have the potential to retain all the key benefits of standard therapeutic antibodies including high manufacturing yields and low immunogenicity.

We have conducted in vivo preclinical studies of our LockBody technology platform with CD47 for the treatment of solid tumors. We believe this preclinical data reinforces the potential of this technology to minimize the systemic effects of potent immune effectors and its potential to significantly improve the therapeutic index. Following clearance of our IND application from the FDA in January 2023, we have initiated a Phase 1/2a first-in-human, clinical trial of our first LockBody candidate, LB101, a conditionally tetravalent PD-L1xCD47 bispecific monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of solid tumors. We look to this study to provide validation to further advance LB101 and our LockBody technology platform.
Disease Overview 
According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the World Health Organization (“WHO”), the global solid tumor burden has increased to an estimated 19 million new cases and up to ten million deaths per year. According to the American Cancer Society, in the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 1.9 million new cases and over 600,000 solid tumor deaths annually.
Tumors are sometimes described as being “hot,” meaning that they have been infiltrated by the body’s T-cells, a part of the body’s immune system. For this reason, hot tumors typically respond to immunotherapy treatment using checkpoint inhibitors to mobilize the T-cells’ response to kill tumor cells. In contrast, “cold” tumors have not been infiltrated with T-cells and, as a result, immunotherapy drugs often have limited effect on these tumors.
While major improvements in understanding the biology of cancer and its treatment have been made in the past decades, there remains a significant unmet medical need for a large number of cancer patients across many different types of cancers. The advent of immunotherapies has been a significant advance in cancer treatment; however, modern immunotherapies, including the checkpoint inhibitors which target the PD1/PD-L1 pathway, are only effective in a minority of patients. 
Currently approved checkpoint inhibitors are mostly active in the minority of “hot” tumors. The majority of solid tumors, however, are “cold”, where no clear underlying immune response to the tumor exists. While a large body of evidence supports the potential of other immunotherapeutic approaches such as targeting CD47 in the treatment of many cancer types, actual clinical success has been very limited in part because of the narrow therapeutic index of available investigational agents. Our LockBody technology has been designed to address this gap. 
We are aware of several programs under development as potential treatments for solid tumors, including those which utilize CD47 with or without PD-L1 to target tumor cells. These include Gilead Sciences, Inc., developing CD47 IgG combinations; ALX Oncology Holdings, developing SIRP receptor-Fc fusion + IgG combinations; Light Chain Bioscience, developing CD47 bispecific antibodies; Innovent Biologics, Inc., developing a PD-L1xCD47 bispecific; and Pfizer, developing a PD-L1xCD47 bispecific.
We are also aware of programs under development, including those which utilize CD3 with or without PD-L1 to target tumor cells. These include Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc., developing activatable CD3 bispecifics; Takeda, developing activatable CD3 bispecifics; Sanofi, developing activatable CD3 bispecifics; and CytomX Therapeutics, Inc., developing activatable CD3 bispecifics. 
LB101, our First LockBody Product Candidate, in Solid Tumors
Overview
LB101, a conditionally tetravalent PD-L1xCD47 bispecific monoclonal antibody, is our first product candidate using our proprietary LockBody technology. LB101 has two anti-CD-47 domains blocked by two anti-PD-L1 domains, with proprietary human IgG-derived hinges linking the anti-CD47 and anti-PD-L1 domains. The cell-killing mechanism of action, in this case CD47, is designed to be blocked by the PD-L1 tumor targeting domain until the proprietary human IgG-derived hinges are naturally degraded in the TME, thus unlocking and activating the CD47 effector function activity in the tumor. Following clearance of our IND application from the FDA in January 2023, we initiated a Phase 1/2a first-in-human, clinical trial of LB101 for the treatment of solid tumors and dosed the first subject in March 2023. We own worldwide rights to LB101.

Figure 10: The LB101 construct is designed to remain ‘locked’ in the periphery such that the CD47-binding contingent Fab remains inactive. The anti-PD-L1 constitutive Fab is designed to target LB101 to the TME. After proteolytic ‘unlocking’ in the TME, the anti-CD47 contingent Fab is designed to engage with its target. 
In Vivo Data
In June 2022, we presented in vivo data for LB101 at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Annual Meeting. These data showed LB101’s antitumor activity in a syngeneic mouse model (colon adenocarcinoma) with significantly improved tumor regression and survival compared to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. Anti-tumor activity was also demonstrated in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model for non-small cell lung cancer. LB101’s immunomodulatory effect differs from PD-L1/PD 1 inhibitors. In a mouse model, LB101 displayed a differential immune profile compared to atezolizumab with a significant increase in pro-killing CD8+ T-cells and a decrease in immunosuppressive M1 and M2 macrophages in tumor samples.
Figure 11: In vivo data in a MC38 hPD-L1+ syngeneic mouse model demonstrated significantly improved activity with durable responses for single-agent LB101 (26 of 32 tumors eradicated across two doses) compared to isotype control IgG (0 of 16) and atezolizumab (4 of 32 across two doses).
In September 2022, we shared data from non-GLP repeat dose, dose range finding, and the GLP repeat dose safety toxicology studies performed with LB101 in cynomolgus monkeys. These data did not reveal any LB101-related toxicity following repeated weekly intravenous doses of LB101 at levels up to 50 mg/kg over 4 weeks. Of note, no anemia, thrombocytopenia or LB101-related changes in cytokine levels were observed in animals administered up to 50 mg/kg of LB101.

Figure 12: Doses up to 50mg/kg of LB101 in non-human primates showed no effect on key hematological parameters.
Following clearance of our IND application from the FDA in January 2023, we initiated a Phase 1/2a first-in-human (“FIH”), open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study with expansion cohorts to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary activity of LB101 in participants with advanced solid tumors. This study consists of 2 parts: FIH dose escalation and dose optimization (Part 1a and Part 1b, respectively) and dose expansion (Part 2). Part 1 will evaluate LB101 monotherapy in participants with selected, advanced solid tumors and determine the recommended dose(s) for expansion for Part 2. The design of Part 2 depends on the results of Part 1 and will further evaluate the safety, efficacy, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immune response of LB101. This study is also expected to provide insights into the performance of our LockBody technology platform in a clinical setting. We dosed the first subject with LB101 in March 2023. 
PD-L1xCD3 LockBody® Program 
We are currently developing a conditionally bivalent PD-L1xCD3 bispecific monoclonal antibody designed to selectively drive potent CD3 effector function activity in the TME while avoiding systemic toxicity. The PD-L1xCD3 

LockBody program is currently in lead optimization with the next anticipated milestone being selection of a product candidate this year and the initiation of IND-enabling activities.
ORX750 in Narcolepsy Type 1 (“NT1”) and other sleep disorders 
In March 2023, we nominated our newest product candidate, ORX750, an orally administered, selective OX2R agonist for the treatment of NT1 with potential expansion into other sleep disorders. 
Narcolepsy is a lifelong, chronic neurologic disorder that affects the brain’s ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. Narcolepsy is a chronic rare and debilitating disorder that is estimated to affect over 150,000 people in the United States and over three million people worldwide. Approximately, 50% of individuals with narcolepsy have NT1.
We believe that introduction of orexin agonists as novel therapeutics will represent a disruptive approach in the treatment of NT1 because orexin agonists, unlike any current marketed treatments, have the potential to directly address the underlying pathology of the disorder, which is the profound loss of orexinergic neurons. Our exclusive collaboration with Sosei Heptares, a leading biopharmaceutical drug discovery and development company with proprietary structure-based drug design (“SBDD”) technology for G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) targets, in the orexin agonist area provides access to unique structural biology technology coupled with SBDD, currently applied to the identification and optimization of molecules towards clinical candidates. 
While prevailing treatment approaches may address the symptoms of NT1, there are no currently approved therapies that address the loss of orexin, which is the underlying pathophysiology of the disorder. A number of selective OX2R agonist compounds are currently in development for the treatment of narcolepsy including TAK-861 being developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals (“Takeda”), JZP441 (DSP-0187) being investigated by Jazz Pharmaceuticals (“Jazz”) and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo”), and ALKS 2680 being investigated by Alkermes. There are additional orexin agonist programs in preclinical development.
ORX750 is currently in preclinical development and undergoing IND-enabling activities.
MGX292 in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (“PAH”)
We are developing MGX292, our product candidate for the treatment of PAH. MGX292 is a protein-engineered variant of human BMP9. MGX292 is designed to overcome the functional deficiency in BMP9 signaling found in patients with PAH, restore vascular function and reverse established disease pathology in the pulmonary arterioles. MGX292 is currently being developed as a subcutaneous formulation. 
PAH, a severe form of pulmonary hypertension, is a progressive life-limiting disease caused by narrowing of small pulmonary arteries in the periphery of the lung. PAH is a rare disease with a major unmet medical need. PAH has a prevalence of 11 to 26 per million individuals, affecting approximately 70,000 patients in North America, Europe and Japan. The total global market for PAH is estimated at $6.0 billion per annum based on sales of approved drugs. 
While approved drugs for PAH exist, current treatments do not impact the underlying pathophysiology of the disease and are not disease-modifying. Although we are not aware of any competitors developing BMP-based agonists for PAH, Merck & Co., Inc. has submitted their product candidate, sotatercept, for regulatory approval in the United States, and Keros Therapeutics, Inc. is currently investigating KER-012.
MGX292 is currently in preclinical development.

Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our differentiated business model, approach, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face, and will continue to face, competition from companies focused on more traditional therapeutic modalities. We expect substantial competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and recruiting patients in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. The key competitors for our programs are described in the respective sections.
We also face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and licensing and acquisition opportunities, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. As a result, we may not be successful in our efforts in building a pipeline of product candidates through acquisitions, licensing or through internal development or in progressing these product candidates through clinical development. Although our research and development efforts to date have resulted in the identification, discovery and preclinical and clinical development of certain product candidates, these product candidates may not be safe or effective as therapies, and we have discontinued product candidates and may not be able to develop, in-license or otherwise acquire any other product candidates.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates. Other than as discussed below, most of our subsidiaries have not entered into long-term agreements with our current CMOs. We generally intend to continue to rely on CMOs for later-stage development and commercialization of our product candidates, including any additional product candidates that we may identify. Although we rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our CMOs and are not overly dependent on a single CMO.
Sales and Marketing
We intend to evaluate our commercialization strategy as we advance each product candidate through clinical development. In any core markets outside of the United States that we may identify, where appropriate, we may utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to expand the commercial availability of our product candidates.
Intellectual Property and License Agreements
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents and patent applications intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We have entered into various license agreements to obtain the rights to use certain patents for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. As described below, we also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights protecting our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our current and future issued patents, if any, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our intellectual property portfolio. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents, if issued, will provide sufficient protection from competitors.
Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) to determine priority of invention.

Orexia License Agreement
In January 2019, Heptares Therapeutics Limited entered into a license, assignment, and research services agreement with Orexia Limited, which was amended and restated in 2020 (together the “Agreement”), relating to certain specific molecules with, among other criteria, the primary mode of action of an orexin agonist or orexin positive modulator (“Molecules”). Under the agreement, Heptares assigned to Orexia all of Heptares’ right, title, and interest in and to intellectual property that is already in existence and that is developed as a result of the agreement that relates solely to Molecules or products that contain Molecules (“Products”), including all rights to obtain patent or similar protection throughout the world for such intellectual property and to take any and all actions regarding past infringements of existing intellectual property. Additionally, Heptares granted to Orexia an exclusive, sublicensable (subject to certain terms) license to make, import, export, use, sell, or offer for sale, including to development, commercialization, registration, modification, enhancement, improvement, manufacturing, holding, keeping or disposing of Molecules and Products. Heptares must not by itself or through a third party (other than a single company) exploit, use or dispose of (inter alia) any product in the field of orexin agonism and orexin positive modulation for the duration of the agreement and for three years thereafter.
In consideration for the assignment and license, Orexia is to pay Heptares a royalty in the low single-digits on net sales of Products (subject to limitations in certain scenarios). Royalties are on a Product-by-Product and country-by country basis. Payments shall commence with the first commercial sale of such product in a country and shall continue until the later of: (a) the duration of regulatory exclusivity in the country; or (b) ten years after the first commercial sale. Further, 

Orexia is responsible for all development costs incurred by itself or Heptares in the performance of the research program (within the confines of the research budget). Additionally, Orexia must pay Heptares, on a Molecule-by-Molecule basis, development milestone payments in the aggregate of a low double-digit number in the millions of pounds sterling. Milestone payments are payable once per Molecule.
Orexia may terminate the agreement at any time following the expiration or termination of the research program. In addition, customary termination rights exist for both parties for breach and insolvency. In the event of termination, all licenses automatically terminate. The term of the agreement is until the later of: (i) the expiration of the last to expire patent within the licensed intellectual property; (ii) the expiration of the royalty term; and (iii) the fifteenth anniversary of the effective date. Upon expiration, with respect to any given Molecule, the license granted to Orexia shall become perpetual, irrevocable, and fully-paid up.
Government Regulation
United States Food and Drug Administration Regulation
The FDA, and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our vendors, collaboration partners, clinical research organizations (“CROs”), and CMOs, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate United States federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or post-approval may subject an applicant to delays in development or approval, as well as administrative and judicial sanctions.
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidates are early-stage and have not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA before they may be marketed in the United States. For our drug product candidates regulated under the FDCA, FDA must approve a New Drug Application (“NDA”). For our biologic product candidates regulated under the FDCA and PHSA, FDA must approve a BLA. The process is similar and generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP, requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made;


• | approval of the protocol and related documentation by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”), requirements and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all pivotal trials;


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review;


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (“cGMPs”), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure and preserve the drug or biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


• | satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including, where applicable, consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States.

Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. In the United States, the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.
An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. In the United States, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a trial.
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
The FDA may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. Imposition of a clinical hold could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner. In addition, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at 

designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may recommend that the clinical trial be stopped if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. In the United States, information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.

• | Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.


• | Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.


• | Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants exposed to the drug or biologic and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the drug or biological characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate.

FDA Marketing Application Review Process
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA (for a drug) or BLA (for a biologic) requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient or clinically active component, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan within 60 days after an End-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA generally does not apply to a drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
In the United States, the FDA reviews all submitted NDAs and BLAs to ensure they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA or BLA for filing. The FDA makes a decision on accepting an NDA or BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards, including cGMP requirements, designed to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original NDA for a new molecular entity or BLA filed for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs or BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions may be available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs or BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA may refer an application for a drug or biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without 

first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety or efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patent registries. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation (“ODD”), to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug or biologic for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the NDA or BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval. Additionally, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”), sponsors of designated platform technologies may receive expedited development and review of any subsequent application for a drug or biologic that uses or incorporates the platform technology.

A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s application before the application is complete upon satisfaction of certain conditions.
In addition, a new drug or biological product may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic, alone or in combination with or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track, or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For an original NDA for a new molecular entity and a BLA, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over available treatments, and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”), that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
For drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires sponsors to conduct, in a diligent manner, adequate and well-controlled post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies with due diligence, failure to confirm a clinical benefit during the post-approval studies, or dissemination of false or misleading promotional materials would allow the FDA to withdraw the product approval on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval are subject to prior review by the FDA unless the FDA informs the applicant otherwise.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and priority review do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.
Under FDORA, a platform technology incorporated within or utilized by a drug or biological product is eligible for designation as a designated platform technology if (1) the platform technology is incorporated in, or utilized by, a drug approved under an NDA or BLA; (2) preliminary evidence submitted by the sponsor of the approved or licensed drug, or a sponsor that has been granted a right of reference to data submitted in the application for such drug, demonstrates that the platform technology has the potential to be incorporated in, or utilized by, more than one drug without an adverse effect on quality, manufacturing, or safety; and (3) data or information submitted by the applicable person indicates that incorporation or utilization of the platform technology has a reasonable likelihood to bring significant efficiencies to the drug development or manufacturing process and to the review process. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a platform technology as a designated platform technology concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND application for a drug that incorporates or utilizes the platform technology that is the subject of the request. If so designated, the FDA may expedite the development and review of any subsequent original NDA or BLA for a drug that uses or incorporates the platform technology. Designated platform technology status does not ensure that a drug will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval. In addition, the FDA may revoke a designation if the FDA determines that a designated platform technology no longer meets the criteria for such designation.

Post-Approval Requirements for Drugs and Biologics in the United States
In the United States, drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by Company employees but also by agents of the Company or those speaking on the Company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products carry reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved drugs and biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our CMOs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug and biological products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;


• | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;


• | mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information;


• | fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;


• | holds on clinical trials;


• | refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs.

Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components that are regulated under separate regulatory authorities and by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. A combination product is comprised of a combination of a drug and a device; a biological product and a device; a drug and a biological product; or a drug, a device, and a biological product. Under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product includes:

• | a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;


• | two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;


• | a drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or


• | any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.

Under the FDCA, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. That determination is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product, which means the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product, i.e., the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.
United States Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA.
Regulatory exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not 

previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
The FDCA also provides three years of exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent for other conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
In addition, both drugs and biologics can also obtain pediatric exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
United States Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively (“ACA”), signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars in the United States. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. The first biological product determined to be interchangeable with a branded reference product for any condition of use is also eligible for a period of exclusivity, during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the same reference product for any condition of use. The FDA may approve multiple “first” interchangeable products so long as they are all approved on the same first day of marketing. This exclusivity period, which may be shared among multiple first interchangeable products, lasts until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(6). At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
Other United States Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Other United States Healthcare Laws
Healthcare providers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which companies research, sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In addition, transparency laws and patient privacy laws can apply to the activities of pharmaceutical manufactures. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that can affect a pharmaceutical company’s operations include without limitation:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but such exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection;


• | The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the FCA, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement, including providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label, material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the federal government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;


• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates as well as their covered subcontractors. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;


• | The federal legislation commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;
• | Federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; 


• | Federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and


• | Analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. 

Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations with respect to certain laws. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect our business in an adverse way. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. Ensuring our business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business.
Health Reform
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “ACA”) was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs; and creates a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition to coverage under Medicare Part D for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted:
•The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequence legislation, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress that include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers will be further reduced starting in 2025 absent further legislation. 
•The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
•On April 13, 2017, CMS published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.
•On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain 

circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 
•On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. In addition, in February 2023, HHS issued a proposal in response to an October 2022 executive order from President Biden that includes a proposed prescription drug pricing model that will test whether targeted Medicare payment adjustments will sufficiently incentivize manufacturers to complete confirmatory trials for drugs approved through FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket spending cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries from $7,050 to $2,000 starting in 2025, thereby effectively eliminating the coverage gap; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition; require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation; and delay until January 1, 2032 the implementation of the HSS rebate rule that would have limited the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Reimbursement
Sales of our products, when and if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare 

organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:

• | a covered benefit under its health plan;


• | safe, effective and medically necessary;


• | appropriate for the specific patient;


• | cost-effective; and


• | neither experimental nor investigational.

In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS, which decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, coverage determination is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Further, coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of biosimilars for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (“AMP”), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare 

beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and reimbursement. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and biologics is a time-consuming and costly process, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Assuming coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of prescribed products.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
European Drug Development
In the EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation provide that, by January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the new Regulation. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State) and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU. The main characteristics of the new Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (“Concerned Member States”) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Concerned Member State. Strict deadlines have also been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications.
We are in the process of applying to renew our status with the EMA as a small and medium-sized enterprise (“SME”). If we obtain SME status with the EMA, it will provide access to administrative, regulatory and financial support, including fee reductions for scientific advice and regulatory procedures.
European Drug Review and Approval
In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (“MA”). There are two main types of MAs:

• | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of EU and the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as products produced by biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a MA, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (“RMS”). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SmPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Concerned Member States) for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
European Data and Market Exclusivity
In the EU, innovative medicinal products (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products), sometimes referred to as new active substances, approved on the basis of a complete and independent data package, generally qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon an MA and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the 

additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed in the EU until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an MA for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
European orphan designation and exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan designation in respect of a product if its sponsor can establish that: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU, when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or, if such a method exists, the product would be of a significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers, and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following marketing approval for the orphan medicinal product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, an MA may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the MA holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the MA holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
European pediatric investigation plan
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”), with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”), and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the product for which MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted an MA with the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate (“SPC”) extension,  provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to two years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority Medicines (“PRIME”), scheme is intended to encourage product development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the MA application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Applicants will typically be at the exploratory clinical trial phase of development and will have preliminary clinical evidence in patients to demonstrate the promising activity of the medicine and its potential to address to a significant extent an unmet medical need. In exceptional circumstances, products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies, if compelling nonclinical data in a relevant model provide early evidence of promising activity, and first in man trials indicate adequate exposure for the desired pharmacotherapeutic effects and tolerability. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MA application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained 
If an MA for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: 
•Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations. 
•The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
•The marketing and promotion of authorized products, including industry-sponsored continuing medical education and advertising directed toward the prescribers of products and/or the general public, are strictly regulated in the EU. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is prohibited across the EU. 
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians or other health care professionals to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
Payments made to physicians or other healthcare professionals in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, 

applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The UK officially withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020 and the EU and the UK signed a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore aligns in many ways with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. For example, the UK has implemented the now repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now that has come into effect is not yet known, however the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), the UK’s medicines regulator, has conducted a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the United Kingdom clinical trials legislation. Such consultation ran from January 17, 2022 to March 14, 2022, and the MHRA is currently analyzing feedback. However, notwithstanding that there is no wholesale recognition of EU pharmaceutical legislation under the TCA, under the new framework mentioned below which will be put in place by the MHRA from January 1, 2024, the MHRA has stated that it will take into account decisions on the approval of MAs from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for a Great Britain MA. On February 27, 2023, the UK government and the European Commission announced a political agreement in principle to replace the Northern Ireland Protocol with a new set of arrangements, known as the “Windsor Framework”. This new framework fundamentally changes the existing system under the Northern Ireland Protocol, including with respect to the regulation of medicinal products in the UK. In particular, the MHRA will be responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the UK market (Great Britain and Northern Ireland), and the EMA will no longer have any role in approving medicinal products destined for Northern Ireland. Once the Windsor Framework is approved by the EU-UK Joint Committee, the UK Government and the EU will enact legislative measures to enact it into law.
Great Britain is no longer covered by the EU’s procedures for the grant of MAs (Northern Ireland is covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered as a CMS under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A separate MA will be required to market drugs in Great Britain. All medicinal products with a valid centralized MA on January 1, 2021 were automatically converted into Great Britain MAs (unless the MA holder opted out of such a conversion). For three years from January 1, 2021, the UK’s regulator, the MHRA, may adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new MAs through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to MAs approved in a country in the European Economic Area (although in both cases an MA will only be granted if any Great Britain-specific requirements are met). This is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of MAs made by the European Medicines Agency and certain other regulators. Various national procedures are now available to place a product on the market in the UK, Great Britain, or Northern Ireland. The MHRA offers a 150-day assessment timeline for all high quality applications for a UK, Great Britain or Northern Ireland MA. The 150 day timeline does not, however, include a “clock-off” period which may occur if issues arise or points require clarification following an initial assessment of the application. Such issues should be addressed within a 60-day period, although extensions may be granted in exceptional cases.
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan designation has applied in Great Britain. There is now no pre-MA orphan designation (as there is in the EU) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an MA application for a UK or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation are the same as in the EU, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the EU, and the prevalence of the condition must be no more than 5 in 10,000 person in Great Britain).

Cybersecurity and Personal Data Processing
The collection, use, transfer, disclosure, retention, security and other processing of personal data (including, without limitation, clinical trial data and other personal health data) (collectively, “Process” or “Processing”) may be subject to independent and overlapping data security and privacy regulatory frameworks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. These frameworks are evolving and may impose potentially conflicting obligations. For example, in the EEA, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which became effective May 25, 2018, governs the Processing of personal data. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that Process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers (such as clinical trial sponsors) of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct data protection impact assessments for “high risk” Processing, expanded the scope of rights data subjects can exercise, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data, like the U.S. Such transfers of personal data outside of the EEA require the use of a valid “transfer mechanism” and, in many cases, the implementation of supplementary technical, organizational and/or contractual measures (see below). Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to request deletion of personal data in certain circumstances and claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. 
In addition, further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. The UK Government has announced plans to reform the data protection legal framework in its Data Reform Bill but those have been put on hold. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission (“EC”) has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing. 
To enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the UK, adequate safeguards must be implemented in compliance with European and UK data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. Transfers made pursuant to the new standard contractual clauses need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to ensure the law in the recipient country provides “essentially equivalent” protections to safeguard the transferred personal data as the EEA, and required businesses to adopt supplementary measures if such standard is not met.
The UK is not subject to the EC’s new standard contractual clauses but has published a UK-specific transfer mechanism, the International Data Transfer Agreement, which entered into force on March 21, 2021 and enables transfers from the UK. It requires a similar assessment of the data protection provided in the importer’s country. We are required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the EU and UK GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost.
In the United States, there are a broad variety of data protection laws and regulations that may apply to our activities such as state data breach notification laws, state personal data privacy laws (for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”)), state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws. In California, the CCPA was enacted in June 2018, became effective on January 1, 2020, and was modified by the California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective on January 1, 2023. The CCPA broadly defines personal information, and creates new individual privacy rights and protections for California consumers (as defined in the 

law), places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA requires covered business to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. While there is a broad exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA as well as clinical trial information, the CCPA may impact certain of our personal information processing activities if we become a "Business" regulated by the scope of the CCPA.
In addition to the CCPA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states in the U.S. and in the U.S. Congress, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which trend may accelerate depending on the new U.S. presidential administration. The effects of the CCPA, and other similar state or federal laws, are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation.
Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable data protection laws and regulations such as the GDPR, UK GDPR and CCPA will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place new or additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with current, evolving and new data protection requirements. This may be an onerous undertaking and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EEA, the UK and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, privacy, information security, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Employees and Human Capital
As of March 1, 2023, we had an aggregate of 83 full-time employees and 41 contractors. A contractor is defined as anyone directly contracted for a certain number of hours or days or in respect of a particular project. This does not include anyone that is engaged on an ad-hoc basis or contracted through a CRO or other firm without a direct contract. 33 of our employees have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 46 employees are engaged in research and development and 37 are engaged in business development, finance, legal, and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resource objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase shareholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. We also seek to align the incentives of the operational teams at our subsidiaries with our business objectives by employing incentivization agreements with such individuals.
As a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds.
