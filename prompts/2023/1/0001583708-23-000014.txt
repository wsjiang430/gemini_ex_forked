ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Cybersecurity is indispensable to our digital way of life, with millions of cyberattacks occurring every year resulting in trillions of dollars in damages. We are in the midst of a generational shift in cybersecurity, ushered in by the ongoing digital transformation of the enterprise. Attacks can inflict damages that span operational disruption, leadership change, loss of customer trust, and intellectual property theft, among others. The rise and persistence of cyberattacks clearly shows that there is a long way to go from here. Enterprises must deploy solutions that enable them to stay one step ahead of attackers and address intrusion attempts in real-time at machine speed - empowering human operators with the speed, scale, and precision of technology.
We envisioned a revolutionary data and artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm where technology alone could autonomously prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. It is time to fight machine with machine. We pioneered the world’s first purpose-built AI-powered Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platform to make cybersecurity defense truly autonomous, from the endpoint and beyond. Our Singularity Platform instantly defends against cyberattacks - performing at a faster speed, greater scale, and higher accuracy than otherwise possible from any single human or even a crowd.
Our Singularity Platform ingests, correlates, and queries petabytes of structured and unstructured data from a myriad of ever-expanding disparate external and internal sources in real-time. We build rich context and deliver greater visibility by constructing a dynamic representation of data across an organization. As a result, our AI models are highly accurate, actionable, and autonomous. Our distributed AI models run both locally on every endpoint and every cloud workload, as well as on our cloud platform. Our Static and vector-agnostic Behavioral AI models, which run on the endpoints themselves, provide our customers with protection even when their devices are not connected to the cloud. In the cloud, our Streaming AI detects anomalies that surface when multiple data feeds are correlated. 
Furthermore, our platform provides visibility across an organization’s digital assets through one console, making it easy and very fast for analysts to search through petabytes of data to investigate incidents and hunt threats. Our Singularity Platform offers multi-tenancy and can be deployed on a diverse range of environments that our customers choose, including public, private, or hybrid clouds.
On each endpoint and cloud workload, we run highly optimized AI models in a single lightweight software agent. Our Static AI model predicts file-based attacks of all types, even previously unknown threats, often referred to as “zero-day attacks,” with extreme precision in milliseconds. Our Behavioral AI model maps, monitors, and links all behaviors on the endpoint to create rich, contextual narratives that we call Storylines. These high-fidelity Storylines are continuously evaluated by our Behavioral AI model. When activity is deemed a threat, our software autonomously takes action to kill the attack. Because Storylines contain a complete record of unauthorized changes made during an attack, we are ready to remediate or roll back these changes. 
The power to turn back time on a device is unique in the market. It is the ultimate safety net and exemplifies autonomous cybersecurity. Therefore, our software eliminates manual, expensive, and time-consuming incident cleanup. In the cloud, our platform aggregates Storylines. Our Streaming AI detects anomalies that surface when multiple data feeds are correlated with additional external and internal data. By providing full visibility into the Storyline of every secured device across the organization through one console, our platform makes it very fast for analysts to easily search through petabytes of data to investigate incidents and proactively hunt threats. 
We have extended protection and visibility beyond the traditional endpoint to cloud workloads, identity credentials, unmanaged devices, and IoT devices. This empowers security analysts of all skill levels to hunt, investigate, and remediate even the most sophisticated threats across the network leveraging automated context provided by our Storylines. Our proprietary data stack - DataSet - and cloud architecture enable us to retain this rich, contextual data on behalf of our customers for extended periods of time in a highly cost-efficient manner. All of this threat intelligence is fed back into our AI model and further strengthens our algorithms, creating a strong flywheel effect and deepening our competitive moat. 
Our Singularity Platform can be flexibly deployed on the environments that our customers choose, including public, private, or hybrid clouds. Our feature parity across Windows, macOS, Linux, and Kubernetes offers best-of-breed protection, visibility, and control across today’s heterogeneous information technology (IT) environments. Together, these capabilities make our platform the logical choice for organizations of all sizes, industry verticals, and compliance requirements. Our platform offers true multi-tenancy, which enables the world’s largest organizations and our managed security providers and incident response partners with an excellent management experience. Our customers realize improved cybersecurity outcomes with fewer people. 
Our Singularity Platform is used globally by organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. Our AI and automation driven approach to cybersecurity has been adopted by some of the world’s largest organizations. As a result, we have grown rapidly since our inception. As of January 31, 2023, we had over 10,000 customers, increasing from over 6,700 as of January 31, 2022. Our revenue for fiscal 2023 and 2022 was $422.2 million and $204.8 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 106%. During this period, we continued to invest in growing our business to capitalize on our market opportunity. As a result, our net loss for fiscal 2023 was $378.7 million compared with net loss of $271.1 million in fiscal 2022. 
Industry Background
Cybersecurity is fundamentally a data problem. Advances in AI, specifically machine learning, where algorithms use data to make decisions with minimal human intervention, are already revolutionizing fields such as healthcare, advertising, and securities trading. We believe that AI is ripe for revolutionizing cybersecurity. First, organizations need to ingest, normalize, and correlate petabytes of structured and unstructured data from a myriad of external and internal data in a cost efficient manner. Second, organizations need to apply powerful AI models on this high-fidelity contextual data to automatically detect known and unknown threats, then autonomously remediate and neutralize the threats. It is critical that we harness the power of data and AI to protect our digital way of life. 
Stakes are high for organizations and cybercriminals. The exponential growth of sensitive customer and business data has simultaneously made many organizations and governments the target of highly sophisticated cybercriminals. Powered by very large networks of individual attackers distributed worldwide, cybercrime is practically infinite in scale and transcends geographical boundaries. To gain access to an organization’s data, cybercriminals target endpoints, applications, user credentials, and deploy a variety of sophisticated methods in the form of attack frameworks, machine learning, weaponized exploits, fileless techniques, and social engineering. As a result, solutions that help strengthen and scale their cyber defenses cost effectively is a top-level priority for organizations today. 
Tectonic shifts in IT require a “Zero Trust” operating procedure. With millions of remote devices accessing thousands of applications running in public, private and hybrid clouds, traditional perimeter-based security controls are bypassed and organizations have to operate in a “Zero Trust” IT environment. The attack surface has expanded considerably, and the notion of a corporate perimeter protected by firewalls is a relic of the past, making the endpoint the epicenter, and endpoint protection software the first, and last, line of defense. Several tectonic shifts in IT have increasingly left companies vulnerable including:
•Rapid adoption of cloud computing. Cloud computing has become a strategic imperative for organizations to accelerate their digital transformation. Security and compliance is a shared responsibility model between the cloud infrastructure provider and their customer, organizations are looking for technology solutions that protect their growing cloud workloads while enabling flexible deployment options across public, private and hybrid clouds. 
•The operating system landscape is more complex than ever before. The diversification of IT and bring your-own-device policies brought Macs and other devices into today’s organizations. Organizations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that deliver comprehensive defense capabilities and feature parity across a large variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without burdening their IT teams. 
•Proliferation of connected devices. Billions of connected devices are online today and the numbers are only expected to increase. Many of these devices will have little to no built-in security capabilities. Cybercriminals are increasingly exploiting inherent vulnerabilities in these devices to breach organizations. Unmanaged devices are especially vulnerable. As a result, the attack surface has exploded. Visibility across connected devices and continuous assessment of their risk profile has become a top priority for organizations. 
•Remote work is here to stay. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way most organizations operate, accelerating technology’s role in supporting remote work. The pandemic has accelerated the structural shift towards a more distributed workforce. The growth of remote work has increased the risk of cyberattacks. As a result of the accelerated structural shift towards a distributed workforce, organizations are increasingly looking for cybersecurity solutions that safeguard their remote workforce and employee credentials.
Sophisticated cyberattacks circumvent existing security controls. Cyberattacks have evolved from malware to highly sophisticated, organized and large-scale attacks by malicious insiders, criminal syndicates, and nation-states seeking to circumvent existing security controls and undermine critical societal functions through a variety of attacks that are fast acting that take only seconds to breach organizations, exfiltrate data, demand ransoms, and disrupt operations. Alternatively, some attacks, such as advanced persistent attacks (APT), and targeted attacks, are designed to breach the organization and stealthily infiltrate across assets to steal data, facilitate future attacks, or cause other harm over a long period of time, all while operating undetected.
Cybersecurity teams are unable to scale. While the number of connected devices, applications and cyber threats have increased exponentially, organizations are facing an acute shortage of skilled cybersecurity talent. The large number of security solutions that companies have deployed over time generate large volumes of alerts that overwhelm security teams as they have to sift through and analyze. Out of necessity, organizations are demanding solutions that do not require human intervention to prevent, detect, and remediate cyber threats.
Limitations of Existing Solutions 
Organizations must deploy solutions that enable them to stay one step ahead of attackers and address intrusion attempts in real-time. As attackers up the ante, developing new skills and deploying new tactics and techniques, existing tools are often unable to prevent and respond effectively to breaches. The result is a rising number of successful high-profile attacks.
Key limitations of existing tools are that they:
•Cover a limited spectrum of cyber threats. Existing tools, such as signature-based approaches, human-powered monitoring, application whitelisting and sandboxing, are each effective under limited circumstances, but lack the ability to detect the full spectrum of threats organizations are dealing with. For example, signature-based approaches can detect attacks that have been seen previously, but are incapable of preventing a wide range of attacks, such as unknown malware, ransomware, modified versions of previously known attacks and the exploitation of zero day vulnerabilities. In addition, they lack the ability to detect and prevent an increasing number of fileless attacks, that deposit no malware, but instead exploit operating system vulnerabilities and use trusted tools within IT environments. In general, enterprises need to take a more holistic view of security protection across endpoints, cloud environments, and identity credentials. A unified platform approach is needed to deliver comprehensive protection, visibility, and user experience. As a result, despite deploying a myriad of point solutions, organizations have continued to suffer huge losses from cyberattacks.
•Utilize AI approaches that rely on humans to power protection mechanisms. First generation AI tools cannot handle the volume, variety, and velocity of data that must be ingested and analyzed, in real-time, to be effective in preventing breaches. These tools often rely on ineffective pattern-matching algorithms in the cloud that generate so much “noise” that human intervention is required to extract useful “signals.” Without curated, contextual data, these tools only generate more alerts that need to be analyzed by humans. They cannot take action at machine speed and are thus unable to detect and prevent or stop many fast-acting 
attacks. Additionally, due to communication latency with the cloud, these tools cannot generate actionable insights in real-time, which is required to stop many current threats. 
•Lack long-term data visibility to proactively investigate advanced threats. Existing endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools lack the capability to store large sets of historical data cost efficiently, and consequently often only offer limited data retention capabilities. This results in only partial datasets being available for threat hunting and time bound retrospective forensic analysis. Limited historical EDR data makes full incident investigation challenging for security personnel, as they are unable to go back in time and see how the attack breached the organization and progressed.
•Struggle to protect complex modern IT environments. Existing tools were not designed to protect today’s multi-cloud, multi-device, multi-OS IT environments. Vendors have extended their existing solutions by bolting on functionalities, which has led to a wide disparity of capabilities across endpoints and operating systems. Existing tools further lack the ability to identify unmanaged IoT devices which often have very limited, if any, built-in security capabilities and can be used by attackers to access the networks of target organizations. This lack of unified visibility and control over endpoints, cloud workloads, and IoT devices results in gaps in security coverage for organizations. 
•Lack deployment flexibility for organizations. Organizations struggle with the limited deployment methods mandated by existing tools. On-premise tools impose complexity and maintenance burdens on organizations. These tools typically lack the ability to quickly adapt to organizations’ rapidly evolving IT environments, which requires significant upfront investments and configuration and integration efforts. On the other hand, cloud-only cybersecurity vendors are unsuitable for many large and complex enterprises and governments that need private or hybrid cloud solutions to meet their security, regulatory, and compliance requirements. 
•Inhibit technology workflow automation. Many existing tools lack out-of-the box APIs and rely heavily on professional services, which makes the integration and implementation process long, expensive and often unattainable. The lack of flexible workflow integrations limits organizations’ ability to reduce overhead by automating processes, and to improve their security by ensuring that process steps are done quickly, consistently, and according to their predefined requirements.
A new paradigm for cybersecurity is needed to autonomously protect organizations and their heterogeneous IT footprints from highly sophisticated, machine-based attacks in a holistic, seamless, and automated manner.

We intend to continue to add new customers through a product-first approach. This approach enables us to build trusted relationships with a large and rapidly growing group of highly influential managed service and incident response providers, as opposed to creating a dynamic of competition that creates friction between product vendors and service providers. We derive significant customer acquisition benefits from our cloud-delivered platform, which makes it easy to onboard new customers. We are currently certified under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), and we intend to further grow our footprint within the U.S. federal government. We intend to continue to build our relationships with our channel partners, including MSPs, MSSPs, MDRs, OEMs, and IR firms, as well as our alliance partners to expand our market reach. 
•Increase adoption within our customer base. We have been successful in our ability to grow revenue from our customer base as they deploy additional endpoints and expand the use of our platform. As we enhance our platform functionality and value proposition, we expect many of our customers to adopt additional platform functionalities and Singularity modules to address all of their cybersecurity use cases through the same platform and agent. Our customers can seamlessly activate additional modules to expand platform capabilities through the already deployed agent. Module driven growth has been broad-based with notable strength from our cloud and data modules. This enables us to show in-product promotions and trials and to 
drive the expansion of our Singularity Modules. The success of our land-and-expand strategy is evidenced by our greater than 130% dollar-based net retention rate as of January 31, 2023. 
•Expand our global footprint. Revenue generated outside of the United States was 35% for fiscal 2023, compared to 32% for fiscal 2022. We intend to continue to grow our international customer base by increasing our investments in international operations. We are continuing to invest and hire talent to expand our business in Asia-Pacific and Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Latin America. 
•Expand our total addressable market through acquisitions. We evaluate acquisition prospects that align with our platform, customers, and strategic market opportunities. We intend to use these opportunities to extend the reach of our Singularity Platform into adjacencies that complement our core offerings. For example, in May 2022, we acquired Attivo Networks, Inc. (Attivo), a leading identity security and lateral movement protection company, which allowed us to deliver comprehensive identity security as part of our Singularity platform. In addition, through S Ventures, a $100 million fund that we announced in 2022 to invest in next generation category-defining security and data companies, we are able to further enhance our platform capabilities in areas that may be of future interest to us. We are committed to innovation, automation, and securing data wherever it resides with a front-row seat into cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies.
Our Singularity Platform
Our Singularity Platform delivers AI-powered autonomous threat prevention, detection, and response capabilities across an organization’s endpoints and cloud workloads, enabling seamless and automatic protection against a full spectrum of cyber threats. We built our platform to be deployed as a cloud service or in private and hybrid clouds. 
Our platform capabilities are connected through three key patented technologies:
•Data Analytics. Our data analytics technology can ingest, correlate, and query petabytes of structured and unstructured data from disparate external and internal sources at machine speed.
•AI. Our Static, Behavioral, and Streaming AI technologies that run in a distributed manner on our data cloud as well as on every endpoint and every cloud workload we protect. 
•Storyline. Our Storyline technology builds a model of real-time running processes and their behaviors, to create rich, contextual data narratives which become the input to our Behavioral AI model. Storyline powers our unified Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP), EDR, or XDR functionalities. Storyline is the foundation of our EPP while providing unprecedented levels of visibility with contextual information for benign and malicious processes. We extend our fundamental protection, visibility and response capabilities well beyond the endpoint to cloud, and third-party solutions in our Singularity Platform. We designed our platform based on our “design to delight” principle and developed a powerful yet simple and intuitive user experience.
Proprietary Security Data Lake
Dataset is our fully integrated security data lake that seamlessly fuses together the data, access, control, and integration planes of EPP, EDR, Cloud Workload Protection (CWP), Identity Protection, and IoT security into a centralized platform. With our Singularity Platform, enterprises gain access to their security data from multiple sources through a single pane of glass. It was designed with the goal of optimizing scale, cost and performance - what we call the Golden Ratio of Big Data. This is achieved by the use of innovative data structures, storage systems, and algorithms:
•Ingest. Our platform is able to ingest structured and unstructured data from any source, with little to no manual configuration and at unprecedented speed and scale. 
•Normalize. Aligns every data point to extract the shared elements regardless of origin and to produce true insights. 
•Correlate. We correlate events from multiple sources into Storylines which contains event data, both benign and malicious, in a context-rich format for easy understanding.
•Analyze. Our Singularity Platform enriches and visualizes every Storyline with information from Threat Intelligence sources, both homegrown and through integrations with third-party intelligence information services. 
Endpoint Protection
Our next-generation cybersecurity technology provides autonomous real-time protection across all operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, and cloud-native and containerized workloads. Our endpoint protection is powered by distributed AI which resides both on devices as well as in the cloud for always-on, machine-speed protection. It is capable of autonomous decision making on the device and stopping threats in milliseconds rather than minutes, hours or even days. We are able to provide superior performance compared to traditional signature-based antivirus tools and earlier next-gen antivirus products with the following three key capabilities: 
•Static AI. Our on-device AI model can detect file-based attacks, even those that are previously unknown zero-day exploits, with extreme precision in milliseconds. Our Static AI model is the output of a supervised machine learning cycle that is trained on a continuously evolving data set from billions of files coupled with the data from multiple threat intelligence sources, including our proprietary Embedded Threat Intelligence. 
•Behavioral AI. Our on-device AI model continuously scores Storylines from the device to precisely classify individual or group behaviors as benign or malicious. The accuracy of our Behavioral AI is powered by the rich contextual information that is encoded in each Storyline that is being scored. As a result, it is attack vector agnostic because it is not limited to any particular pathway used by attackers to penetrate a system, such as zero-day vulnerability exploits and living off the land attacks.
•Embedded Threat Intelligence. Our cloud threat intelligence system combines threat information from our data analytics and research teams, Vigilance MDR and IR services, and other commercial and proprietary threat feeds. 
Endpoint Detection and Response
Unlike first-generation EDR products that are reactive and mainly focused on collecting data, our ActiveEDR solutions leverage Storylines to reduce analysis time and to automate response actions by significantly minimizing the time between detection and response through technology automation. It enables on-device behavioral analysis, auto-remediation, and response in a fully autonomous fashion. ActiveEDR reduces analysis time and requirements for specialized skills by providing technology-generated context which would otherwise need to be produced by highly skilled people manually in a time-intensive and error prone fashion. ActiveEDR excels at visualizing context, pinpointing anomalies, and providing a variety of granular responses. The main capabilities of ActiveEDR are:
•Deep Visibility Threat Hunting. Deep Visibility Threat Hunting provides an easy-to-use search interface on top of our Deep Visibility dataset. The Storylines shown within Deep Visibility hunts enable one-click responses, which are far easier and faster to execute than manually scripting responses. As a result, both entry level analysts and highly skilled analysts can analyze results faster, review more alerts, and be more productive with the power of technology.
•Response Capabilities. Our Singularity Platform offers one of the broadest sets of response actions in the EDR market. Leveraging Storylines, we automate responses or make them optionally initiated by operators. Our response capabilities enable security analyst to Kill, Quarantine, Remediate, Remote Shell, and Rollback.
Multi-tenancy Architecture
We offer complete multi-tenancy with four tiers— Global, Account, Site, and Group. Policies set at the higher tier of the hierarchy are automatically inherited by the lower levels, but administrators may override them to create local policies at any tier. We also support fully customizable Role Based Access Control (RBAC), that allows organizations to create specific rules controlling console permissions at a granular level. This enables large, distributed teams to work independently while at the same time providing a global view for the CISO and other stakeholders. It further enables our platform adoption by the world’s largest organizations, MSPs, MSSPs, MDRs, OEMs, and IR firms. 
XDR Integrations
Singularity XDR unifies and extends detection, investigation, and response capability across the entire enterprise, providing security teams with centralized end-to-end enterprise visibility, powerful analytics, and automated responses across the technology stack. This empowers security teams to see data collected by disparate security solutions from all platforms, including endpoints, cloud workloads, network devices, email, identity, and more, within a single dashboard. It enables customers to seamlessly extend the power of the Singularity Platform across the entire IT stack—regardless of vendor—to automate response actions. Our XDR integrations give customers the flexibility to operate our platform as a platform-as-a-service in their own customized graphical user interface and workflows simply by leveraging our robust, well-documented and easy-to-use APIs.
IT and Security Operations
Our Singularity Platform enables security and IT teams to identify vulnerabilities, fix insecure configurations, and manage endpoints. Vulnerable and mis-configured applications make it easier for attackers to gain entry and evade detection. Addressing these vulnerabilities and mis-configured settings strengthens the security risk profile of our customers. Our platform has the following capabilities:
•Application Inventory. Maintains a software application inventory across an entire organization, by capturing the list of installed applications and their attributes such as their version numbers, install date, and publisher. Our software collects this information in real-time, enabling our customers to easily search and sort through these attributes in a global application inventory view within the console. Customers can quickly perform software frequency analysis and compliance checks. 
•Scanless Vulnerability Assessment. Using our real-time organization-wide Application Inventory database, our solution is able to provide highly accurate and dynamic Vulnerability Management information without the need to deploy another solution. We do so by matching version information from our Application Inventory database to the known vulnerabilities published as Common Vulnerability Enumeration records.
•Device Control. Allows maximum granularity and flexibility when defining Device Control policies to prevent data exfiltration and malware entry. Our Device Control module supports two main media types: USB and Bluetooth devices. Our Bluetooth Device Control capability augments our IoT capability, limiting pairing with unsanctioned hardware and other wearable devices. We believe the ability to provide granular control for Bluetooth devices in conjunction with other forms of USB media is a competitive differentiator. 
•Native OS Host Firewall Control. Leverages native operating system infrastructure to provide an application-aware and location-aware endpoint firewall orchestrator for remote devices. Firewall control provides visibility, malware prevention, and network segmentation by utilizing the native firewall capabilities on Windows, macOS, and Linux devices. With our Singularity Platform, we enable our users to keep their workforce protected, segment their networks, and block traffic from malicious IPs/C2 servers using the same console that they use to monitor threats.
•File Integrity Monitoring. The data collected by our Deep Visibility EDR can be used to replace traditional file integrity monitoring solutions. Coupled with Storyline Active Response (STAR), our File Integrity solution (FIM) is able to automatically alert or remediate unauthorized changes to these files. Organizations use this to be compliant with PCI DSS and other regulatory requirements while eliminating other agents, products, and spend.
Singularity Platform Tiers
Our Singularity Platform offers a highly flexible deployment model. It is primarily hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) in multiple regions - North America, European Union, Asia Pacific, and AWS GovCloud. We also support deploying our platform in Google Cloud as well as customers’ on-premise data centers, private, and hybrid cloud environments for organizations with specialized hosting and data sovereignty needs. 
Our Singularity Platform provides feature parity across Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides customers with full flexibility through a multi-tier offering priced on a per agent basis, which generally corresponds with an endpoint, server, virtual machine, or host. The tiers of our Singularity Platform include:
•Singularity Core. Our entry level security solution for organizations that want to replace antivirus tools with our EPP which we believe is more effective and easier to manage than legacy antivirus and next-gen antivirus products. Singularity Core includes our Static and Behavioral AI models and autonomous threat response and rollback features. 
•Singularity Control. Made for organizations seeking best-of-breed security with the addition of our “security suite” features for endpoint management. It provides additional features for control network connectivity, USB and Bluetooth peripherals, and to uncover rogue devices. 
•Singularity Complete. Our flagship offering that includes a comprehensive suite of product capabilities.
Singularity Platform Modules
We further offer customers a broad set of capabilities through our Singularity Modules. We price our modules as a subscription on a per agent basis. Our most notable modules include: 
Cloud Security
Our Cloud Workload Protection (CWP) solution extends distributed, autonomous endpoint protection, detection, and response to compute workloads running in public clouds, private clouds, and on-prem data centers. Our runtime protection delivers prevention, detection, response and hunting functionalities purpose-built for these environments. We offer full-fledged EPP and EDR for servers, virtual machines, and containerized workloads. Our Cloud Application Control locks down the running image of servers and containers to prevent configuration drift and protect against unauthorized changes, in line with best practices for cloud workload security.
Identity Protection
Our identity security portfolio acts as a force multipliers for security teams, allowing them to assume a more robust security posture and extend the capabilities of the Singularity Platform to protect user credentials. Our Singularity Identity solution detects and responds to identity-based attacks and finds attackers early, before they can exploit identities. Our identity solution also reduces the potential attack surface and proactively increases security by identifying misconfigurations and credential exposures that create attack paths for attackers to move laterally. Our identity security portfolio includes: 
•Singularity Identity detects real-time identity attacks across the enterprise that target Active Directory and Active Directory (Azure AD). It delivers holistic identity threat detection and response including credential theft, privilege escalation, lateral movement, data cloaking, identity exposure, and more for zero trust cybersecurity.
•Singularity Ranger Active Directory uncovers vulnerabilities in Active Directory and Azure AD with a cloud-delivered, continuous identity assessment solution. It provides instant Active Directory visibility of misconfigurations, suspicious password changes, credential harvesting, unauthorized access, and more.
•Singularity Hologram lures network and insider threat actors into revealing themselves. Through misdirection of the attack with tactics including breadcrumbs and decoy accounts, files and IPs, organizations gain the advantage of time to detect, analyze, and stop an attacker without impacting enterprise assets.
Attack Surface Management 
Our Ranger module enables control of the enterprise network attack surface in real time by discovering, identifying, and containing any device-based threat. Ranger leverages the presence of our software in an organization’s network to track assets, create an Enterprise Asset Map, perform network segmentation, deploy our agents to unprotected devices, and provide risk scores. Ranger provides organization-wide inventory and control of IoT devices by discovering connected devices, including virtual machines, containers, and IoT devices such as printers, smart TVs, and thermostats. Ranger has four key component features: 
•Rogue Discovery. Enables administrators to identify unprotected or “rogue assets” and verifies our agent is installed on all corporate assets.
•Ranger Insight. Provides a clear picture of the inventory and risk in the IoT environment, including open ports, header and application versions, and vulnerability information, 
•Rogue Control. Creates network segments to restrict access to a corporate network. Rogue Control prevents unsanctioned devices, such as guest machines, from connecting to authorized networks.
•Ranger Auto-Deploy. Rapidly deploys our agents using service credentials to unprotected endpoints with no additional IT infrastructure or software. Auto-Deploy provides security teams with complete, instant asset coverage.
Mobile Endpoint Security 
Our Singularity Mobile module enables customers to manage mobile devices through behavioral AI-driven protection, detection, and response directly for iOS, Android, and ChromeOS devices. It delivers mobile threat defense that is local, adaptive, and real-time, to thwart mobile malware and phishing attacks at the device, with or without a cloud connection. It is the industry’s leading on-device behavioral AI product that dynamically detects never before seen malware, phishing, exploits, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Singularity Mobile provides security and data privacy to support zero trust.
XDR Power Tools
Our Singularity XDR Power Tools modules complement and extend Singularity EDR & XDR capabilities for organizations seeking advanced investigative workflows and a long, retrospective look back to support comprehensive incident response. These modules include:
•Binary Vault. Enables customers to store and download copies of any file that has been executed in their environment for forensic review and reverse engineering. Binary Vault can store a copy of every known binary, both benign and malicious, that executes across an enterprise. This enables advanced security analysts to download a copy of any file that has been executed in their environment for forensic review and reverse engineering, and provides them with access to a broader dataset and more complete lookback capabilities than any of our competitors.
•Remote Script Orchestration (RSO). Enables enterprises and incident responders to investigate and respond to threats on multiple endpoints across the organization remotely, enabling them to easily manage their entire fleet. In incident response situations, rapid artifact extraction and endpoint state querying across the entire enterprise is critical. Our remote script orchestration module allows concurrent execution of 
custom and preset scripts across an enterprise, instead of having to triage with a device by device approach. By converging our protection, detection, and response capabilities with remote script orchestration, our platform is the only solution that is needed to respond to a breach.
•Storyline Active Response (STAR). STAR gives users the capability to set custom Indicators of Compromise (IOC) based rules for real-time analysis, alerting, and automatic response workflows. Our STAR module is also capable of ingesting threat intelligence feeds to enhance and correlate analyses. The STAR module uses Streaming AI technology to match billions of events to tens of millions of IOCs at the time of ingestion. STAR is a threat hunting and workflow orchestration force multiplier. Without STAR, it is difficult for security analysts to keep pace with the number and complexity of emerging threats from an EDR perspective. 
•Data Retention. Offers data retention from one month to three years and beyond. Modern attacks can take days and weeks to initiate after infiltration. Therefore, it is critical for an EDR solution to provide visibility for extended periods of time. This enhances both retrospective analysis and proactive hunting measures. Our platform has been designed and built to support extended data retention to time periods that far exceed what others are able to offer, and we do so on a cost-efficient basis due to our data retention architecture. We offer data retention for up to three years to provide maximum value from our Deep Visibility Threat Hunting module.
•Cloud Funnel. Allows organizations to export their XDR data in real-time to their private data lakes, whether locally-hosted or in the cloud. It securely streams a copy of all endpoint EDR telemetry to a customer’s local data lake for further correlation with other security tools, while allowing offline data storage for audit and compliance.
