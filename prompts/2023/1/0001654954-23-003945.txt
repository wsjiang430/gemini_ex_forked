ITEM 1—BUSINESS
Overview

Tenax Therapeutics was originally formed as a New Jersey corporation in 1967 under the name Rudmer, David & Associates, Inc., and subsequently changed its name to Synthetic Blood International, Inc. Effective June 30, 2008, we changed the domiciliary state of the corporation to Delaware and changed the Company name to Oxygen Biotherapeutics, Inc. On September 19, 2014, we changed the Company name to Tenax Therapeutics, Inc.

On November 13, 2013, we acquired a license granting Life Newco, our wholly-owned subsidiary, an exclusive, sublicensable right to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing levosimendan, 2.5 mg/ml concentrate for solution for infusion / 5ml vial in the United States and Canada. On October 9, 2020 and January 25, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the license to include two new oral products containing levosimendan, in capsule and solid dosage form, and a subcutaneously administered product containing levosimendan, subject to specified limitations.

On January 15, 2021, we acquired 100% of the equity of PHPrecisionMed Inc., a Delaware corporation, or PHPM, with PHPM surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result of the merger, we are developing and plan to commercialize pharmaceutical products containing imatinib for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. 

Business Strategy

Having carefully considered alternatives within the ongoing strategic process announced in September 2022, and having raised capital to fund the Company through to the first quarter of 2024, the Company has recently elected to prioritize the Phase 3 testing of levosimendan, ahead of imatinib, with plans to commence a levosimendan Phase 3 study in 2023. Supporting this strategic decision is a U.S. Patent issued in March 2023, covering the use of IV levosimendan in patients with PH-HFpEF. This patent is the second levosimendan patent granted to Tenax since the start of 2022, and Tenax believes it provides strong precedent for the ongoing review of a third patent which might be granted in 2023 or 2024. This prioritization of the Phase 3 testing of levosimendan places the start of a Phase 3 imatinib trial likely outside the 2023 timeframe, pending fundraising to support that trial, as well as other strategic considerations.

The Company took steps to reduce its monthly operating expenses and conserve cash, as it commenced exploring strategic alternatives. The Company has cancelled substantially all of its non-essential operating expenses such as consulting, its office lease, and dues and subscriptions and office supplies associated with that leased office.

Prior to announcing the strategic process, our principal business objective has been to identify, develop, and commercialize late-stage pharmaceutical therapeutic products for serious cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases with high unmet medical need. The Company has been developing TNX-103 (oral levosimendan) for the treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension with Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (PH-HFpEF) and TNX-201 (modified release imatinib) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Both TNX-103 and TNX-201 are Phase 3-ready assets, each with the potential to meaningfully impact the quality and longevity of patient lives.

Pending the outcome of our strategic process, the key elements of our long-term business strategy are outlined below.

Efficiently conduct clinical development to establish clinical proof of principle in new indications, refine formulation, and commence Phase 3 testing of our current product candidates.

Levosimendan and imatinib have been approved and prescribed around the world for more than 20 years, but we believe their mechanisms of action have not been fully exploited, despite promising evidence they may significantly improve the lives of patients with pulmonary hypertension. We are conducting clinical development with the intent to establish proof of beneficial activity in cardiopulmonary diseases in which these therapeutics would be expected to have benefit for patients with diseases for which either no pharmaceutical therapies are approved at all, or in the case of PAH, where numerous expensive therapies generally offer a modest reduction of symptoms. Our focus is primarily on designing and executing formulation improvements, protecting these innovations with patents and other forms of exclusivity, and employing innovative clinical trial science to establish a robust foundation for subsequent development, product approval, and commercialization. We intend to submit marketing authorization applications following either one or two Phase 3 trials of levosimendan and, when appropriate, a single Phase 3 trial of imatinib. Our trials are designed to incorporate and reflect advanced clinical trial design science and the regulatory and advisory experience of our team. We intend to continue partnering with innovative companies, renowned biostatisticians and trialists, medical leaders, formulation and regulatory experts, and premier clinical testing organizations to help expedite development, and continue expanding into complementary areas when opportunities arise through our development, research, and discoveries. We also intend to continue outsourcing when designing and executing our research.

Efficiently explore new high-potential therapeutic applications, in particular where expedited regulatory pathways are available, leveraging third-party research collaborations and our results from related areas.

Levosimendan has shown promise in multiple disease areas in the two decades following its approval. Our own Phase 2 study and open-label extension has demonstrated that a formerly under-appreciated mechanism of action of levosimendan, its property of relaxing the venous circulation, brings about durable improvements in exercise capacity and quality of life, as well as other clinical assessments, in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and associated pulmonary hypertension (PH-HFpEF). We believe this patient population today has no pharmaceutical therapies available and we are committed to exploring potential clinical indications where our therapies may achieve best-in-class profile, and where we can address significant unmet medical needs.

We believe these factors will support approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) of these product candidates based on positive Phase 3 data. Through our agreement with our licensor, Orion Corporation (“Orion”), the originator of levosimendan for acute decompensated heart failure, we have access to a library of ongoing and completed trials and research projects, including certain documentation, which we believe, in combination with positive Phase 3 data we hope to generate in at least one indication, will support FDA approval of levosimendan. Likewise, the regulatory pathway for approval of imatinib for the treatment of PAH, as formulated by Tenax Therapeutics at the dose shown to be effective in a prior Phase 3 trial conducted by Novartis, allows Tenax to build on the dossier of research results already reviewed by the FDA. In order to achieve our objectives of developing these medicines for new groups of patients, we have established collaborative research relationships with investigators from leading research and clinical institutions, and our strategic partners. These collaborative relationships have enabled us to explore where our product candidates may have therapeutic relevance, gain the advice and support of key opinion leaders in medicine and clinical trial science, and invest in development efforts to exploit opportunities to advance beyond current clinical care. Additionally, we believe we will be able to leverage clinical safety data and preclinical results from some programs to support accelerated clinical development efforts in other areas, saving substantial development time and resources compared to traditional drug development.

Continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio.

Our intellectual property, and the confidentiality of all our Company information, is important to our business and we take significant steps to help protect its value. Our research and development efforts, both through internal activities and through collaborative research activities with others, aim to develop new intellectual property and enable us to file patent applications that cover new applications of our existing technologies, alone or in combination with existing therapies, as well as other product candidates. We received in 2022 a patent covering the subcutaneous administration of levosimendan (TNX-102) in humans for any medical condition, through 2039. On March 21, 2023, we received our second patent for this product, covering the IV formulation of levosimendan (TENX-101) tested in the Phase II HELP trial in patients with PH-HFpEF. At present, we have two patents pending, with additional decisions expected in 2023.

Enter into licensing or product co-development arrangements.

In addition to our internal development efforts, an important part of our product development strategy is to work with collaborators and partners to accelerate product development, maintain our low development and business operations costs, and broaden our commercialization capabilities globally. We believe this strategy will help us to develop a portfolio of high-quality product development opportunities, enhance our clinical development and commercialization capabilities, and increase our ability to generate value from our proprietary technologies.

Our Current Programs

TNX-101 (IV), TNX-102 (subcutaneous) and TNX-103 (oral) ( (levosimendan) Background

Levosimendan was discovered and developed by Orion. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer/K-ATP activator developed for intravenous use in hospitalized patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. It is currently approved in over 60 countries for this indication but is not available in the United States or Canada. It is estimated that to date over 1.5 million patients have been treated worldwide with levosimendan.

Levosimendan is a novel, first in class calcium sensitizer/K-ATP activator. The therapeutic effects of levosimendan are mediated through:


· | Opening of potassium channels in the vasculature smooth muscle, resulting in a vasodilatory effect on all vascular beds. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Increased cardiac contractility by calcium sensitization of troponin C, resulting in a positive inotropic effect which is not associated with substantial increases in oxygen demand.
· | Opening of mitochondrial potassium channels in cardiomyocytes, resulting in a cardioprotective effect. 


Several studies have demonstrated that levosimendan protects the heart and improves tissue perfusion while minimizing tissue damage during cardiac surgery.

In 2013, we acquired certain assets of Phyxius Pharma, Inc. (“Phyxius”), including its North American rights to develop and commercialize intravenous levosimendan for any indication in the United States and Canada. The license was subsequently amended in 2020 to include the rights to develop and commercialize oral and subcutaneous formulations of levosimendan. In the countries where it is marketed, intravenous levosimendan is indicated for the short-term treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure in situations where conventional therapy is not sufficient, and in cases where inotropic support is considered appropriate. In acute decompensated heart failure patients, levosimendan has been shown to significantly improve patients’ symptoms as well as acute hemodynamic measurements such as increased cardiac output, reduced preload and reduced afterload.

TNX-101 (IV), TNX-102 (subcutaneous) and TNX-103 (oral) (levosimendan) Development for Pulmonary Hypertension Patients

In 2020, we completed a Phase 2 clinical trial of intravenous levosimendan in North America for the treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with heart failure with PH-HFpEF, a disease defined hemodynamically by a mean pulmonary artery pressure (“mPAP”) of ≥25 mmHg, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure “(PCWP”) of >15 mmHg. Pulmonary hypertension in these patients is believed to arise from a passive backward transmission of elevated filling pressures from left-sided heart failure. These mechanical components of pulmonary venous congestion can trigger pulmonary vasoconstriction, decreased nitric oxide availability, increased endothelin expression, desensitization to natriuretic peptide induced vasodilation, and vascular remodeling. Over time, these changes often lead to advanced pulmonary arterial and venous disease, increased right ventricle afterload, and right ventricle failure.

PH-HFpEF is the most common of five forms of pulmonary hypertension, with an estimated U.S. prevalence exceeding 1.5 million patients. Currently, no pharmacologic therapies are approved for treatment of PH-HFpEF. Despite the fact that many therapies have been studied in PH-HFpEF patients, including therapies approved to treat PAH patients, no therapies have been shown to be effective in treating PH-HFpEF patients.

Several published studies provide evidence that levosimendan may improve right ventricular dysfunction which is a common comorbidity in patients with pulmonary hypertension. While none of these studies have focused specifically on PH-HFpEF patients, the general hemodynamic improvements in these published studies of various types of pulmonary hypertension provide a basis for further research into the potential beneficial impact of levosimendan in PH-HFpEF patients.

In March 2018, we met with the FDA to discuss development of levosimendan in these patients. The FDA agreed with our planned Phase 2 design, patient entry criteria, and endpoints. It was agreed the study could be conducted under the existing investigational new drug application with no additional nonclinical studies required to support full development. The FDA recognized there were no approved drug therapies to treat PH-HFpEF patients and acknowledged this provided an opportunity for a limited Phase 3 clinical program. This topic was discussed further at the End-of-Phase 2 Meeting following completion of the Phase 2 study in PH-HFpEF patients, which is known as the HELP Study - Hemodynamic Evaluation of Levosimendan in PH-HFpEF.

We initiated the first of our HELP Study clinical sites in November 2018 and the first of 37 patients was enrolled in the HELP Study in March 2019. Enrollment in the HELP Study was completed about one year later, in March 2020. The primary endpoint of the HELP Study was based on the change in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (“PCWP”) during exercise versus baseline compared to placebo. The HELP Study utilized a double-blind randomized design following five weekly outpatient infusions of levosimendan.

On June 2, 2020, we announced preliminary, top-line data from the study. The primary efficacy analysis, PCWP during exercise did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction from baseline. Levosimendan did demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in PCWP compared to baseline (p=<0.0017) and placebo (p=<0.0475) when the measurements at rest, with legs up, and on exercise were combined. Levosimendan also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in 6-minute walk distance as compared to placebo (p=0.0329). These findings from the HELP Study represent important discoveries related to the use of levosimendan in PH-HFpEF patients since this is the first study to evaluate levosimendan in PH-HFpEF patients and this is the first study ever conducted of any therapy in PH-HFpEF patients to show such positive improvements in hemodynamics and 6-minute walk distance.

Hemodynamic Results

Hemodynamic measurements were made at rest (supine), after leg raise on a supine bicycle (a test of rapid increase in ventricular filling) and during exercise (25 watts for three minutes or until the patient tired). In the initial open-label phase, 84% of the patients had a significant reduction in right atrial pressure (“RAP”), pulmonary artery pressure, (“PAP”), and PCWP at rest and during exercise. In the randomized double-blinded 6-week trial, levosimendan demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PCWP compared to baseline (p=<0.0017) and placebo (p=<0.0475) when these three measurements were combined: at rest, with legs up, and on exercise. While there was no significant change in PCWP during exercise, patients receiving levosimendan had reductions from baseline at Week 6 in PCWP and PAP that were statistically significant when patients were “at rest” and/or with their “legs raised” (p<0.05).
Clinical Results (6-Minute Walk Distance)

The clinical efficacy was confirmed by a statistically significant improvement in 6-minute walk distance of 29 meters (p=0.0329). The 6-minute walk distance was a secondary endpoint in the trial and is a validated and accepted endpoint used in many pulmonary hypertension registration trials.
Safety

The incidence of adverse events or serious adverse events between the control and treated groups was similar. In addition, there were no arrhythmias observed, atrial or ventricular, when comparing baseline electrocardiographic monitoring with 72-hour monitoring after five weeks of treatment.

The detailed results from the Phase 2 HELP Study of levosimendan in PH-HFpEF were presented at the Heart Failure Society of America Virtual Annual Scientific Meeting on October 3, 2020 and at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2020 on November 13, 2020. Additionally, the full manuscript was published in the peer-reviewed journal JACC: Heart Failure. Burkhoff D, Borlaug BA, Shah SJ, …Rich S. Levosimendan Improves Hemodynamics and Exercise Tolerance in PH-HFpEF: Results of the Randomized Placebo-Controlled HELP Trial. JACC Heart Fail. 2021 May;9(5):360-370.

Next Steps

On October 9, 2020, we entered into an Amendment to the License Agreement between the Company and Orion to include two new product formulations containing levosimendan, in a capsule solid oral dosage form (TNX-103) and a subcutaneously administered dosage form (TNX-102), to the scope of the license, subject to specified limitations. On January 4, 2022, Tenax Therapeutics was issued US Pat. No. 11,213,524, entitled PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS FOR SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION OF LEVOSIMENDAN.

10


Following their completion of the randomized treatment phase of the HELP trial, patients were able to enter a study extension. For over two years, Tenax and our HELP investigators continued studying the safety and efficacy of TNX-103 in all patients participating in the open-label extension of the HELP Study, all of whom previously received weekly infusions of intravenous levosimendan. These patients were safely transitioned from the intravenous to the oral formulation in late 2021, with positive signs of efficacy observed across all measured parameters during the transition study phase of the open-label extension study (“OLE”). We expect the OLE to come to a conclusion in the first half of 2023.

In October 2020, we met with the FDA for an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting to discuss the Phase 2 clinical data and further development of levosimendan in PH-HFpEF patients. The FDA agreed that one or two Phase 3 clinical studies (depending on the size) with a primary endpoint of change in 6-minute walk distance over 12 weeks or a single Phase 3 trial with clinical worsening (e.g., death, hospitalization for heart failure, or decline in exercise capacity) over 24 weeks would be sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of levosimendan in PH-HFpEF. The FDA also agreed to a plan to replace weekly intravenous levosimendan dosing with daily TNX-103 doses in a Phase 3 clinical study. The FDA expressed that a safety database could be necessary and indicated that the need for a larger safety database could be dependent on the final design of the Phase 3 study. A proposed Phase 3 study design was provided in late 2021 for FDA review and comment on the safety database requirements at filing. In February 2022, the FDA advised in a written response that the safety database at NDA filing only need meet the minimum International Clinical Harmonization (ICH) standards for a chronic medication.

The HELP Study design was novel in several respects. To date, no other multi-center study has evaluated levosimendan in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (“HFpEF”) patients or PH-HFpEF patients. Instead, all previous levosimendan heart failure studies have enrolled heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (“HFrEF”), therefore specifically excluding HFpEF patients. Also, the HELP Study utilized a unique 24-hour weekly infusion regimen of 0.075- 0.1µm/kg/min. Finally, the HELP Study employed a unique home-based intravenous infusion administration via an ambulatory infusion pump. This home-based weekly intravenous administration is unlike all other chronic dosing studies of levosimendan that have typically employed a shorter duration and less frequent infusion regimen administered in a hospital setting. The transition of patients in the OLE from intravenous to oral therapy was encouraging. PH-HFpEF has an approximate 50% rate of survival of five years. The patients who enrolled in the HELP study had very advanced disease, with 87% Functional Class III at enrollment. At the time of the transition these patients had already been on levosimendan for two years or longer. The fact that there was an improvement in all measures of efficacy on oral therapy beyond what had been achieved on intravenous therapy speaks to the remarkable durability of the treatment effect.

We believe that the combination of the unique HELP Study patient population, innovative weekly 24-hour dosing, unique home-based site of administration, the transition from intravenous to oral therapy in a subset of these patients who continued in the OLE until the commencement of this transition sub study, and the novel findings of efficacy and safety in PH-HFpEF patients represent important discoveries and significant intellectual property. These discoveries, among others from the HELP Study, form the basis for U.S. patent applications we have filed.

TNX-201 (imatinib) Background

Imatinib (marketed in the U.S. as Gleevec®) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which changed the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (“CML”) following its approval over 20 years ago, as the first curative treatment of chronic leukemia. The first clinical trial of imatinib took place in 1998 and the drug received FDA approval in May 2001. Encouraged by the success of imatinib in treating CML patients, scientists explored its effect in other cancers, and it was found to produce a similar positive effect in malignancies where tyrosine kinases were overexpressed.


11


Tyrosine kinases are important mediators of the signaling cascade, determining key roles in diverse biological processes like growth, differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis in response to external and internal stimuli. Deregulation of protein kinase activity has been shown to play a central role in the pathogenesis of human cancers. Imatinib, a 2-phenyl amino pyrimidine derivative, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against ABL, BCR-ABL, PDGFRA and PDGFRB, and c-KIT. Imatinib works by binding close to the ATP binding site, therefore inhibiting the enzyme activity of the protein. Imatinib also inhibits the ABL protein of noncancer cells. Imatinib is well absorbed after oral administration with a bioavailability exceeding 90%. It is extensively metabolized, principally by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and CYP3A5 and can competitively inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 substrates. Imatinib is generally well tolerated in cancer patients. Common side effects include fluid retention, headache, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weakness, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention, edema, rash, dizziness, and muscle cramps. Serious side effects may include myelosuppression, heart failure, and liver function abnormalities. Novartis manufactures Gleevec.

Previous Imatinib Development for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Patients

In PAH, a rare disease, patients who remain symptomatic despite available therapies have a high morbidity and mortality. Though several therapies are now available, there is no cure for the disease, and there is no data supporting that the existing approved therapies, all of which are pulmonary vasodilators, halt progression or induce regression of the disease. Imatinib has been shown in animal models of pulmonary hypertension to induce disease reversal by an effect on platelet derived growth factor (“PDGF”), which appears to be causal in the disease. After that discovery was made, several case reports and small case series of patients with advanced PAH failing combination pulmonary vasodilator therapy were published showing a dramatic effect of imatinib on stabilizing and improving these patients. This led Novartis to develop imatinib as a treatment of PAH.

Novartis sponsored a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of imatinib as an adjunct to PAH-specific therapy in patients with PAH. This was a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of PAH subjects who remained symptomatic on one or more PAH therapies in WHO Functional Class (FC) II-IV. The Phase 2 trial of imatinib in PAH caused significant hemodynamic improvement in some patients but failed to meet the primary endpoint of an increase in 6-minute walk distance (22 meters, p=NS). Novartis then sponsored a Phase 3 trial (IMPRES) which met its primary endpoint of significant increase in 6-minute walk (32 meters, p=0.002), an effect maintained in the extension study in patients remaining on imatinib. However, the data were confounded by a high rate of dropouts in the patients randomized to imatinib attributed largely to gastric intolerance during the first eight weeks. The sponsor proposed consideration of a surrogate endpoint under the subpart H provision as a basis for approval but was denied. Consequently, Novartis chose to withdraw the Investigational New Drug application as the drug went off patent.

Current TNX-201 Development for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Patients

On May 30, 2019, PHPrecisionMed Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PHPM”), which was to be acquired by Tenax Therapeutics in January 2021, met with the FDA to discuss a proposal for a Phase 3 trial of imatinib for PAH. At that meeting, PHPM discussed a single Phase 3 trial using change in 6-minute walk distance as the primary endpoint (p<0.05). PHPM received agreement for submission under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, and thereafter received orphan designation. In July 2020, PHPM received agreement from the FDA for the development of a modified release formulation that would require only a small comparative PK/bioavailability study. We recruited 16 volunteers, who received a single dose of the modified release formulation and a single dose of the existing immediate release formulation. This formulation was later optimized in preparation for a second Phase 1 study, completed in the second quarter of 2022. A Phase 3 study of TNX-201, this optimized modified release formulation of imatinib, would be the next clinical trial to commence in Tenax’ development planning, pending the outcome of our strategic process and funding of the trial costs.
Manufacturing and Supply

We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of all of our product candidates, and for pre-clinical and clinical studies, and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of third-party manufacturers and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) eliminates the need to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff.

12


Pursuant to the terms of our license for levosimendan, Orion is contractually our sole manufacturing source for TNX-103. We may engage other third-party suppliers and CMOs for the supply and manufacture of TNX-102, or other formulations we may develop.

We have engaged various third-party suppliers and CMOs for the supply and manufacture of imatinib for potential future clinical trials, and relied on such contractors for material contributing to TNX-201, for testing in our two completed Phase 1 trials.

As we further develop our product pipeline, we expect to consider secondary or back-up manufacturers for both active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for our product candidates. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands, but we have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical materials to date.

We believe alternate sources of manufacturing will be available to satisfy our clinical and future commercial requirements; however, we cannot guarantee that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources will be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of our product candidates. All of the vendors we use are required to conduct their operations under current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), a regulatory standard for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent applications, patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. We believe that to have a competitive advantage, we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. Currently, we require our officers, employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting, or advisory relationships with us, where appropriate. We also require employees, consultants, and advisors whom we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the workday, developed using our property, or which relate to our business.

We have two granted patents, and two U.S. patent applications pending, related to product candidates and proprietary process, method and technology. Our issued levosimendan patents expire in 2039 and late 2040.

On January 4, 2022, we received a patent for the subcutaneous administration of levosimendan, whether through the formulation we have developed in collaboration with a formulation development partner, or other subcutaneous formulations meeting certain broad characteristics defined in the patent. In addition, we received on March 21, 2023 a patent for the use of IV levosimendan in the treatment of PH-HFpEF patients, based on several discoveries that have emerged from the HELP Study and the OLE.

The U.S. trademark registration for Simdax® is owned by Orion and is licensed to us for sales and marketing purposes for any intravenous pharmaceutical products containing levosimendan that are commercialized in the United States and Canada.

Our success will in part depend on the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, the validity and enforceability of our patents, the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets and our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology and products. Comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property are described under the heading “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Simdax License Agreement

On November 13, 2013, we acquired, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, a license agreement between Phyxius and Orion, which was later amended on October 9, 2020 and January 25, 2022 (as amended, the “License”). The License grants us an exclusive, sublicenseable right to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing levosimendan in the United States and Canada (the “Territory”) and, pursuant to the October 9, 2020 amendment to the License, also includes two product dose forms containing levosimendan, in capsule and solid dosage form, and a subcutaneously administered product containing levosimendan, subject to specified limitations (together, the “Product”). Pursuant to the License, Tenax and Orion will agree to a new trademark when commercializing levosimendan in either of these forms.

Pursuant to the License, we have a right of first refusal to commercialize new developments of levosimendan, including developments as to the formulation, presentation, means of delivery, route of administration, dosage or indication (i.e., line extension products).

Orion’s ongoing role under the License includes sublicense approval, serving as the sole source of manufacture of oral formulations of levosimendan, holding a first right to enforce intellectual property rights in the United States and Canada, and certain regulatory participation rights. Orion must notify the Company before the end of 2024 if it chooses not to exercise its right to supply oral formulations of levosimendan to the Company for commercialization in the Territory. Additionally, the Company must grant back to Orion a broad non- exclusive license to any patents or clinical trial data related to levosimendan developed by the Company under the License. The term of the License extends until 10 years after the launch of a levosimendan product in the United States and Canada, provided that the License will continue after the end of the term in each country in the Territory until the expiration of Orion’s patent rights in levosimendan in such country. In the event that no regulatory approval for levosimendan has been granted in the United States on or before September 20, 2030, however, either party will have the right to terminate the License with immediate effect.

As consideration for the License, we agreed to pay Orion (i) a one-time up-front payment in the amount of $1.0 million, (ii) development milestones consisting of (a) $2.0 million upon the grant of FDA approval and (b) $1.0 million upon the grant of regulatory approval for the Product in Canada, (iii) commercialization milestones aggregating to up to $13.0 million, upon achievement of certain cumulative net sales amounts in the United States and Canada, and (iv) royalties based on net sales of the Product in the United States and Canada. After the end of the License term, the Company must pay Orion a royalty based on net sales of the Product in the Territory for as long as the Company sells the Product in the Territory.

Competition

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical, and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research and development of drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular, pulmonary, and related medical conditions, both rare and common. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, some of them have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. There are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations that are conducting research in areas in which we are working. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of product candidates that are safer and more effective than any competing products.

We believe the concept of using TNX-101/102/103 (levosimendan) to treat patients with PH-HFpEF is novel, and the patent granted for this use in March 2023 demonstrates USPTO’s concurrence. Because no therapies are approved to treat PH-HFpEF, we believe our ability to succeed in the market is primarily dependent on our ability to change the established practice paradigm, which could be difficult. Key factors on which we will compete with regards to the development and marketing of levosimendan for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in these patients include, among others, the ability to obtain adequate efficacy data, safety data, cost effectiveness data and hospital formulary approval, marketing exclusivity, as well as sufficient distribution and handling. Furthermore, while we believe the mechanism of action of levosimendan is novel, other low-priced, generically available products possess some similar qualities, which could present competition in the form of therapeutic substitution.

TNX-201 (imatinib) has the potential to be the first disease-modifying treatment of PAH, a fatal orphan disease. Pulmonary vasodilators, the only approved medications for PAH, do not have disease modifying properties. We do not expect these products, other than one which is not widely used today, to be contraindicated in patients taking TNX-201, and our intended protocol design tests TNX-201 as an additional therapy to one or more of these vasodilators.

Several other companies are developing new therapies to treat PAH, including some that may also be disease-modifying. Novartis developed imatinib for PAH and conducted a Phase 3 trial that in 2013 succeeded in meeting its primary endpoint. However, the high number of dropouts of patients randomized to imatinib led the FDA and EMA to request another trial before they would approve the product in PAH. To address this, we are developing a modified-release oral formulation designed to reduce the stomach’s exposure to imatinib, and the nausea and vomiting commonly observed in patients receiving imatinib. Other companies are developing an inhaled route of administration as their strategy to mitigate gastric intolerance. We believe that our development plan has advantages in that we already know the effective dose of imatinib administered orally, and the systemic exposure from an inhaled route remains uncertain, and costly to determine. Since only the first FDA approved formulation of imatinib to treat PAH will qualify for the seven years of Orphan Drug exclusivity in the U.S., these alternative formulations of imatinib represent potential competitive threats.

In order to compete successfully, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.

Government Regulation

The manufacture and distribution of levosimendan will require the approval of United States government authorities as well as those of foreign countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates medical products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act govern the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our medical products. In addition to FDA regulations, we are also subject to other federal and state regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Environmental Protection Act. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial funds.

Preclinical tests include evaluation of product chemistry and studies to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product and its formulation. The results of the preclinical tests are submitted to the FDA as part of the application. The goal of clinical testing is the demonstration in adequate and well-controlled studies of substantial evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the product in the setting of its intended use. The results of preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the FDA from time to time throughout the trial process. In addition, before approval for the commercial sale of a product can be obtained, results of the preclinical and clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The approval process is affected by a number of factors, including the severity of the condition being treated, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Additional preclinical studies or clinical trials may be requested during the FDA review process and may delay product approval. After FDA approval for its initial indications, further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of a product for additional indications. The FDA may also require post-marketing testing, which can involve significant expense, to monitor for adverse effects.

The effects of government regulations on our business are discussed under the heading “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Regulatory Matters” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
