Overview
 
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in drug research and development to create new therapies for fibrotic disease, cancer and selected other diseases. Our drug candidates are based on our method of targeting galectin proteins, which are key mediators of biologic and pathologic functions. We use naturally occurring, readily-available plant products as starting material in manufacturing processes to create proprietary, patented complex carbohydrates with specific molecular weights and other pharmaceutical properties. These complex carbohydrate molecules are appropriately formulated into acceptable pharmaceutical formulations. Using these unique carbohydrate-based candidate compounds that largely bind and inhibit galectin proteins, particularly galectin-3, we are undertaking the focused pursuit of therapies for indications where galectin proteins have a demonstrated role in the pathogenesis of a given disease. We focus on diseases with serious, life-threatening consequences and those where current treatment options are limited specifically in NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) with cirrhosis and certain cancer indications. Our strategy is to establish and implement clinical development programs that add value to our business in the shortest period of time possible and to seek strategic partners when one of our programs becomes advanced and requires significant additional resources.
 
Our lead galectin-3 inhibitor is belapectin (GR-MD-02), which has been demonstrated in preclinical models to reverse liver fibrosis and cirrhosis and in clinical studies to decrease portal hypertension and prevent its complication: the development of esophageal varices. Belapectin has the potential to treat many diseases due to galectin-3’s involvement in multiple key biological pathways such as fibrosis, immune cell function and immunity, cell differentiation, cell growth, and apoptosis (cell death). The importance of galectin-3 in the fibrotic process is supported by experimental evidence. Animals with the galectin-3 gene “knocked-out” can no longer develop fibrosis in response to experimental stimuli compared to animals with an intact galectin-3 gene. We are using our galectin-3 inhibitor to treat advanced liver fibrosis and liver cirrhosis in NASH patients. We have completed two Phase 1 clinical studies, a Phase 2 clinical study in NASH patients with advanced fibrosis (NASH-FX) and a second Phase 2b clinical trial in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis and portal hypertension (NASH-CX).
 
In February 2023, we completed randomizations totaling 357 patients in a large, global Phase 2b/3 clinical trial. Our study protocol was filed with the FDA on April 30, 2020, for a seamless adaptively-designed Phase 2b/3 clinical study, the NAVIGATE trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of our galectin-3 inhibitor, belapectin, for the prevention of esophageal varices in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis (Further details are available at www.clinicaltrials.gov under study NCT04365868); this study began enrolling patients in Q2-2020. In September 2020, the Company received a letter from the FDA providing comments, asking questions and providing guidance on various aspects of the ongoing NAVIGATE trial. These comments were addressed, and the study proceeded accordingly.
 
Additionally, a study protocol entitled “A Single-dose, Open-label, Pharmacokinetic Study of Belapectin (GR-MD-02) in Subjects With Normal Hepatic Function and Subjects With Varying Degrees of Hepatic Impairment” has been filed with the FDA to examine the effects of the drug in subjects with normal hepatic function and subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (study details are listed under study NCT04332432 on www.clinicaltrials.gov); this study became fully enrolled in February 2022.
 
We endeavor to leverage our scientific and product development expertise as well as established relationships with outside sources to achieve cost-effective and efficient drug development. These outside sources, amongst others, provide us with expertise in preclinical models, pharmaceutical development, toxicology, clinical trial operations, pharmaceutical manufacturing, including physical and chemical drug characterization, and commercial development. We also have established through our majority-owned joint venture subsidiary, Galectin Sciences LLC, a discovery program developing small molecules that inhibit galectin-3 and may afford alternative drug delivery (e.g., oral) and as a result expand the potential uses of galectin-3 inhibitor beyond belapectin. Three chemical series of composition of matter patents have been filed.
 
We are also pursuing a development pathway to clinical enhancement and commercialization for our lead compounds in immuno-oncology following our previous successful collaboration with Providence Portland Cancer Center. In 2022, we filed a new IND with FDA for advanced or metastatic head and neck cancer using belapectin in combination with a checkpoint (PD-1) inhibitor and received a Study May Proceed letter. The proposed phase 2 trial commencement is dependent on timing of financing.
 
All of our proposed products are presently in development, including pre-clinical and clinical trials.
 
We were founded in July 2000 as Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation. On April 25, 2001, DTR-Med Pharma Corp. (“DTR”), which was incorporated in Nevada on January 26, 2001, entered into a stock exchange agreement with Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc., whereby DTR acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On May 10, 2001, DTR changed its name to “Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” and on June 7, 2001, the Massachusetts corporation was merged into the Nevada corporation. On May 26, 2011, Pro-Pharmaceuticals, Inc. changed its name to “Galectin Therapeutics Inc.” In October 2012, we moved our headquarters to a suburb of Atlanta, GA to be closer to a center of discovery collaboration while maintaining a laboratory operation in the Boston area.

Our Drug Development Programs
 
Galectins are a class of proteins that are made by many cells in the body, but predominantly in cells of the immune system. As a group, these proteins are able to bind to sugar molecules that are attached to other proteins, called glycoproteins that are responsible for various functions within the body, most notably inflammation and fibrosis. Galectins, in particular galectin-3,act as a molecular glue, bringing together molecules that have sugars on them. Galectin-3, is known to be markedly increased in a number of significant diseases including inflammatory diseases leading to organs scarring (e.g. liver, lung, kidney, and heart) and cancers. The increase in galectin-3, by creating the so-called galectin-3 fibrosome, promotes the progression of multiple diseases. Published data substantiating the importance of galectin-3 in the fibrotic process arises from gene knockout experiments in animal studies. For instance, mice genetically altered to eliminate the galectin-3 gene, and thus unable to produce galectin-3, do not develop liver fibrosis in response to toxic insult to the liver.
 
We have one new proprietary chemical entity (NCE) in development, belapectin, which has shown promise in preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of liver fibrosis, severe skin disease, and cancer (melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma). Currently, we are focusing on development of belapectin for the treatment of NASH cirrhosis and head and neck cancer. Belapectin is a proprietary, patented compound derived from natural, plant-based, starting materials, which following chemical processing, exhibits the properties of binding to and inhibiting galectin-3.

Melanoma, Head, Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) | belapectin | Investigator IND study was completed. A Phase 1B study began in Q-1 2016. Early data was reported in February 2017 and additional data were reported in September 2018. Data from an extension trial was reported in July 2021 for additional melanoma and HNSCC patients which provided a rational basis for additional trials which the Company is exploring. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company announced its IND application for belapectin in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of HNSCC was filed and a Study May Proceed letter was received from FDA. The Company is reviewing options for financing this trial which will determine when such trial could commence.

Liver cirrhosis. Belapectin is our lead product candidate for treatment of compensated NASH cirrhosis in patients with portal hypertension. Our preclinical data show that belapectin has a significant therapeutic effect on liver fibrosis as shown in several relevant animal models. In addition, in NASH animal models, belapectin has been shown to reduce liver fat, inflammation, portal pressure, and ballooning degeneration (death of liver cells). Therefore, we chose belapectin as the lead candidate in a development program targeted initially at fibrotic liver disease associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In January 2013, an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) was submitted to the FDA with the goal of initiating a Phase 1 study in patients with NASH and advanced liver fibrosis to evaluate the safety of belapectin and pharmacodynamics biomarkers of disease. On March 1, 2013, the FDA indicated we could proceed with a US Phase 1 clinical trial for belapectin with a development program aimed at obtaining support for a proposed indication of belapectin for treatment of NASH with advanced fibrosis. The Phase 1 trial was completed and demonstrated that belapectin up to 8 mg/kg Lean Body Mass (LBM), i.v. was safe and well tolerated.
 
Additionally, an open label drug-drug phase 1 interaction study was completed in healthy volunteers during the second quarter of 2015 with belapectin and it showed that with 8 mg/kg LBM dose of belapectin and 2 mg/kg LBM dose of midazolam there was no drug-drug interaction, and no serious adverse events or drug-related adverse events were observed. The secondary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of belapectin when administered concomitantly with midazolam.
 
Our Phase 2 program in fibrotic disease consisted of two separate human clinical trials. The main clinical trial was the Phase 2b NASH-CX study for one year for patients with NASH with compensated cirrhosis and portal hypertension, which began enrolling patients in June 2015. This study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group Phase 2b trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of belapectin for treatment of liver fibrosis and resultant portal hypertension in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis. A smaller, exploratory NASH-FX trial was conducted to explore potential use of various non-invasive imaging techniques in NASH patients with advanced fibrosis but not cirrhosis.
 
NASH-FX Trial: The NASH-FX trial was a Phase 2a pilot trial for patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis that explored use of three non-invasive imaging technologies. It was a short, single site, four-month trial in 30 NASH patients with advanced fibrosis (F3) randomized 1:1 to either 9 bi-weekly doses of 8 mg/kg LBM of belapectin or placebo. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint as measured using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (LiverMultiScan(R), Perspectum Diagnostics). The trial also did not meet secondary endpoints that measure liver stiffness as a surrogate for fibrosis using, magnetic resonance-elastography and FibroScan® score. With a four-month treatment period and a small number of patients per arm the study was not powered to demonstrate efficacy results in established advanced liver fibrosis. In the trial however, belapectin was found to be safe and well tolerated with no serious adverse events and showing evidence of a pharmacodynamic effect. These results provided support for further development in NASH.
 
NASH-CX Trial: The NASH-CX trial was a larger multi-center clinical trial that explored the use of belapectin for the treatment of patients with well-compensated NASH cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Enrollment was completed in September 2016, and a total of 162 patients at 36 sites in the United States were randomized to receive either 2 mg/kg LBM of belapectin, 8 mg/kg LBM of belapectin or placebo. Approximately 50% of patients at baseline had esophageal varices (a complication of portal hypertension). The primary endpoint was a reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), a hemodynamic measure that estimates portal hypertension. Patients received an infusion of belapectin or placebo every other week for one year and were evaluated to determine the change in HVPG as compared with placebo. Secondary or exploratory endpoints included evaluation of fibrosis on liver biopsy, measurement of liver stiffness (FibroScan) and assessment of liver metabolism (13C-methacetin breath test). Top line data readout was reported in December 2017. The study demonstrated a favorable safety profile and clinically meaningful efficacy results in patients without esophageal varices at baseline as demonstrated by a decrease in portal pressure associated with the prevention of development of varices when compared to placebo.
 
In the total patient population, the primary endpoint HVPG showed a trend toward benefit with belapectin treatment, but the difference from placebo was not statistically significant. The mean change in HVPG of placebo from baseline to week 54 was 0.3 mm Hg. The mean change in HVPG from baseline was -0.37 and -0.42 for the 2 mg/kg LBM dose and 8 mg/kg LBM dose of belapectin, respectively.
 
In those NASH cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension who have not yet developed esophageal varices at baseline (about 50% of the total population), there was a statistically significant effect of the 2 mg/kg LBM dose of belapectin on the absolute change in HVPG (-1.08 mm Hg, p<0.01). The effect of the 8 mg/Kg LBM dose of belapectin on absolute or percent change in HVPG from baseline to week 54 was not significant.
 
Also because of the clinical relevance of this population, a responder analysis was performed on those patients without esophageal varices at baseline. Analysis was performed looking at two groups: those with an equal to or greater than 2 mm Hg decrease in HVPG from baseline or those with an equal to or greater than 2 mm Hg and a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in HVPG from baseline. In both cases, the change observed in the belapectin 2 mg/kg LBM group was statistically significant (p<0.01) while that of the 8 mg/kg LBM group was not.
 
Over the 54-week treatment period, in patients without varices at baseline there were also a statistically significantly fewer new varices that developed in the belapectin treatment groups (0% and 4% in the 2 mg/kg LBM and the 8 mg/kg LBM, respectively) vs placebo (18%). This meant that the decrease seen in portal pressure was associated with a decreased incidence of esophageal varices. The results were noticeable in the belapectin 2 mg/Kg LBM group as statistical significance against placebo was achieved for both parameters. As esophageal varices can lead to hemorrhagic complication, which can be fatal, and are a severe complication of liver cirrhosis, we believe the prevention of esophageal varices may represent a clinically relevant measure of clinical efficacy in patients with NASH cirrhosis.
 
The major conclusions from the NASH-CX trial results were that: (i) belapectin had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect in improving HVPG vs placebo in patients with NASH cirrhosis who did not have esophageal varices at baseline, (ii) Belapectin in the total patient population was associated with a statistically significant improvement in hepatocyte ballooning (ie cell death), (iii) There was a statistically significant reduction (p=0.02) in the development of new esophageal varices in drug-treated patients compared to placebo. We believe that the prevention of esophageal varices is a clinically relevant endpoint related to patient outcomes, (iv) While there was a drug effect in both the 2 mg/kg LBM and 8 mg/kg LBM groups on the development of varices and liver biopsy there was a consistently greater and statistically significant effect of the 2 mg/kg LBM dose of belapectin, (v) belapectin appears to be safe and well tolerated in this one year clinical trial, a feature that is of prime importance for a cirrhotic population and (vi) This is the first large, randomized clinical trial to demonstrate a clinically meaningful improvement in portal hypertension in patients with compensated NASH cirrhosis who have not yet developed esophageal varices.

NASH NAVIGATE Trial: Building on the experience of the NASH-CX trial, the NAVIGATE Trial is a seamless adaptively-designed Phase 2b/3 clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of our galectin-3 inhibitor, belapectin, for the prevention of esophageal varices in patient with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis. The major features of this innovative Phase 2b/3 study design are: i) In patients with NASH cirrhosis and clinical signs of portal hypertension but without esophageal varices at baseline, this trial will assess the effect of belapectin on the incidence of new varices (the primary endpoint) – as well as assessing the effect of belapectin on the incidence of additional clinically significant cirrhosis-related outcomes (a key secondary efficacy endpoint), (ii) The study targets NASH patients with a clearly identified unmet medical need: patients with compensated cirrhosis who have clinical signs of portal hypertension and, thus, are at risk of developing esophageal varices, a potentially life-threatening complication of cirrhosis (bleeding varices are a cause of death in about one-third of cirrhotic patients). There is currently no approved treatment for preventing varices in these patients. In addition, the development of esophageal varices reflects the progression of hepatic cirrhosis and thus portends the development of other cirrhosis complications such as ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and liver failure, and (iii) During the first 18 months, two belapectin dose levels (2 mg/kg LBM and 4 mg/kg LBM) will be compared to placebo (phase 2b). Then, at the interim analysis (IA), the best belapectin dose will be selected, based on efficacy and safety, for continued evaluation (Phase 3). The belapectin dose selected for the phase 2b/3 were based on the analysis of the NASH-CX trial. Prior belapectin clinical studies have also indicated the good tolerance and safety profile of belapectin with doses of up to 8 mg/kg LBM for up to 52 weeks, an important feature to inform the future risk benefit analysis in patients with NASH cirrhosis.
 
The study design provides for a pre-specified interim analysis (IA). The IA of efficacy and safety data will be conducted after all planned subjects in Phase 2b component have completed at least 78 weeks (18 months) of treatment and a second esophago-gastro-duodeno endoscopic assessment. The purpose of the IA is to allow potential seamless adaptive modifications of the study, including: (1) the selection of the optimal dose of belapectin for Phase 3, (2) the re-estimation of the study sample size for Phase 3 portion of the trial, (3) the re-evaluation of the randomization ratio for the Phase 3 portion of the trial, (4) the refinement of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the Phase 3 portion of the trial, including the cirrhosis status, (5) and/or termination of the study for overwhelming efficacy or for futility.
 
The trial design also includes a blinded sample size re-estimation (“SSR”) during the Phase 2b, prior to the IA, to allow for potential sample size readjustment. The SSR will be conducted when 50% of the patients have completed 18 months of therapy. This will allow us to confirm the underlying assumption regarding the rate of varices development, currently estimated from our prior Phase 2b trial (NASH-CX). The study design also minimizes invasive testing requirements, such as the measurement of HVPG or repeated liver biopsies, which we believe are particularly risky in patients with portal hypertension and will facilitate enrollment and retention of patients. It also provides for a seamless transition of patients from the Phase 2b component into the phase 3 stage, including the potential addition of new patients. The trial design preserves the surrogate end-point concepts (development of new varices versus variceal hemorrhage) previously discussed with FDA.
 
We believe that these adaptations taken together are innovative and optimize conduct of the NAVIGATE trial with a clinically relevant primary outcome giving belapectin the best opportunity to show a positive therapeutic effect to address an unmet medical need. As a testimony of this innovation, the NAVIGATE trial design was presented to the hepatology community and featured during the last meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, in November 2021. If the IA results of the NAVIGATE trial are compelling, there could be the potential for accelerated FDA approval and/or partnership opportunity with a pharmaceutical company.
 
In the Phase 3 component of this trial, as proposed in the protocol, the primary endpoint remain the development of varices. Secondary endpoints include a composite clinical outcomes endpoint, including varices requiring treatment (development of large varices or varices with a red wale), decompensating events, all-cause mortality, MELD score increase, liver transplant. Also, NASH non-invasive biomarkers will be evaluated. To target a population at risk of developing esophageal varices, patient selection will be based on clinical signs of portal hypertension, including, but not limited to, a low platelet count, an increased spleen size and/or evidence of abdominal collaterals circulation.
 
The focus and goal of the therapeutic program is to stop the progression of and/or reverse portal hypertension and thereby prevent the development of varices, potentially one of the most immediately life-threatening complication of cirrhosis. Based on the results of the NASH-CX trial and subject to confirmation in later stage clinical trials, we believe that this goal is achievable in a significant portion of the NASH cirrhosis patient population i.e. those NASH cirrhosis patients with clinical signs of portal hypertension for whom, currently no specific, liver targeted, treatment are available.
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed and may continue to delay our regulatory and ethics approvals, recruitment of sites, and enrollment of patients for our Phase 2b/3 NAVIGATE trial despite a recent uptick in screening activities. Many investigational centers in the United States and Europe have experienced shut-downs, and while some have loosened or removed restrictions, there may be a risk of experiencing new shut-downs and restrictions. In some countries, shutdown orders have also affected the regulatory process to authorize study starts. Governments and medical facilities focused their resources for battling the COVID-19 pandemic. For several reasons, the pandemic made enrolling patients for the NAVIGATE trial more challenging, including because patients eligible for the NAVIGATE trial have liver cirrhosis and, as such, are at a greater health risk of complications from COVID-19. It is also important to consider the safety of our candidate participants first, as cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension are immune compromised. As we emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, site recruitment and patient enrollment accelerated and we experienced increases in enrollment, particularly in the United States.  However, we did not see the enrollment in Europe that we anticipated, and conditions there remain uncertain. Consequently, we activated multiple sites in Latin America.  The final patient was randomized in February 2023, and we expect topline results from the IA in Fall of 2024.
 
We have activated more than 150 clinical trial sites in 14 countries for the NAVIGATE trial.
 
Further details on the NAVIGATE trial can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov under study NCT04365868 and on our NAVIGATE website (navigatenash.com).

The Company also has commenced a Hepatic Impairment Study, which will run in parallel with the phase 2b/3 trial as part of the development program. The Hepatic Impairment Study is being conducted at three sites and involves approximately 40 patients (divided amongst normal healthy volunteers, and patients with hepatic impairment categorized as Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classes A (mild), B (moderate), and C (severe). Each subject will receive a single infusion of belapectin (4 mg/kg LBM) and their serum belapectin levels will be monitored for up to approximately two weeks to define the effects of various stages of cirrhosis on serum belapectin levels. The tolerance and safety of belapectin will be evaluated. Enrollment in this study was completed in February 2022, and the results will be announced when available. Based on the results from this hepatic impairment study, the Company may consider including patients with more advanced cirrhosis in the Phase 3 portion of its NAVIGATE trial. Until dosing and safety profile is further informed in CTP Class B and/or Class C patients, the NAVIGATE trial will enroll only CTP Class A patients. Further details on this hepatic impairment study can be found on www.clinicaltrials.gov study NCT04332432.
 
Cancer Immunotherapy. We believe there is potential for galectin inhibition to play a key role in the innovative area of cancer immunotherapy. For example, there have been several recent approvals of drugs that enhance a patient’s immune system to fight cancer. It is our goal to use ourgalectin-3 inhibitor to further enhance the immune system function to help the body to fight cancer in a way that complements other approaches to this type of therapy. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that galectin-3 is expressed at high levels in multiple types of tumors and their micro-environment, where it fosters the malignant nature of the tumors, and protects the tumors from immune attack by the patient’s own defense mechanism. Our drug candidates provide a promising new therapeutic approach to enhance the activity of the immune system against cancer cells. Preclinical studies have indicated that belapectin enhances the immune response to cancer cells, increased tumor shrinkage and enhanced survival in immune competent mice with prostate, breast, melanoma and sarcoma cancers when combined with one of the immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1, or with the immune cell activator anti-OX40. These preclinical data led to the filing of two Investigator-sponsored INDs and the initiation of Phase 1B studies of belapectin in combination with Yervoy® (ipilimumab) in metastatic melanoma and another phase 1B study in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) in patients with metastatic melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. These studies were conducted under the sponsorship of Providence Portland Medical Center’s Earle A. Chiles Research Institute (EACRI).
 
The phase IB study in combination with Yervoy was rapidly discontinued after the first patients were recruited because of the availability of new treatment in the selected population.
 
Promising results were reported in the Phase 1b trial combining belapectin with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®). When aggregated cohorts are combined, in advanced melanoma, a 50% objective response rate with belapectin in combination with KEYTRUDA, was documented. In addition, a 33% response rate was documented in patients with head and neck cancer The results have been published in 2021 in a highly rated peer reviewed journal (Curti et al. Journal of Immunotherapy of cancer 2021;9:e002371). There was also a suggestion that the combination of belapectin with pembrolizumab could decrease the auto-immune side-effect induced by pembrolizumab. These side-effects, which are directly linked to the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, can be poorly tolerated and even severe enough to lead to treatment interruption, even if the effect on the cancer was encouraging. This is, a very frustrating situation for patients who have to discontinue an active treatment but have no other options available to them. We believe these data, taken together with the observed favorable safety and tolerability of the combination, provide a rationale to move the belapectin program in oncology forward.
 
Late in 2021, we engaged three noted physicians – Dr. Chetan Bettegowda, from Johns Hopkins, and Dr. Nishant Agrawal and Dr. Ari Rosenberg, both from University of Chicago Medical Center – as consultants to help define the path forward in oncology. In consultation with our oncology experts, we have now selected the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer as the lead indication to pursue for belapectin in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The decision is notably based on the lack of available treatments for these patients, the limited number of therapies in development, and the resulting very high medical need. We filed an IND with FDA and are planning a phase 2 trial to be filed with the FDA oncology division.

The scheduled expiration dates of our many of our United States patents span out to 2034 before considering any potential extensions. We have corresponding patent applications pending in various territories where we see potential for commercial interest. Additionally, we have patent applications in other areas to utilize our carbohydrate-based compounds to treat disease other than cancer. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property”. Our competitive position, in part, is contingent upon protection of our intellectual property. Galectin Sciences LLC has 3 granted U.S. patents, 11 granted international patents, 2 US patent application pending, and 21 foreign applications pending.
 
Research
 
Our primary focus is on the design and testing of agents that target galectins in various in vitro and in vivo systems and that demonstrate efficacy in treatment of experimentally induced fibrosis or enhance immune system responsiveness in various tissues and in live animal models. We contract with independent laboratories and other facilities to conduct our research, which is designed, evaluated and managed by our scientists. We do not anticipate building additional in-house research or development facilities or hiring significantly additional staff other than for purposes of designing and managing our out-sourced research and development activities.
 
As we develop products eligible for clinical trials, we contract with independent parties to assist in the design of the clinical trial protocols, arrange for and monitor the clinical trials, collect data and analyze data. In addition, certain clinical trials for our products may be conducted by government-sponsored agencies and will be dependent on governmental participation and funding. Our dependence on independent parties and clinical sites involves risks including reduced control over the timing and other aspects of our clinical trials.
 
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our expenditures for research and development were $31.7 million and $23.8 million, respectively. We expense all research and development costs as they are incurred.
 
In January 2014 we created, with SBH Sciences, Inc. (Natick, Ma), Galectin Sciences, LLC, a collaborative joint venture to research and develop small organic molecule inhibitors of galectin-3 for oral administration.
 
Using computer molecular modeling techniques coupled with in vitro screening of a variety of compound libraries, SBH Sciences had identified several small organic molecules with promising galectin-3 inhibitory activity in vitro. Galectin Sciences LLC will further develop these unique organic molecule inhibitors of galectin-3 as drug candidates as well as develop additional candidates. Subject to availability of funding, Galectin Sciences LLC will build on the scientific body of knowledge amassed by SBH Sciences, coupled with Galectin Therapeutics’ knowledge and expertise of galectins’ pathological role and mechanism of action in inflammation, fibrosis and many cancers. The long-term goal of this effort is to identify and develop drug candidates that are highly specific galectin inhibitors which may be formulated for oral administration. The intermediate term goal is the development of small molecule inhibitors of galectin-3 which exhibit activity in in vivo preclinical disease models of fibrosis and cancer in which galectins play a key role. Several patent applications have been filed to protect the various series of compounds discovered by these efforts.
 


 Index

Because increased levels of galectin proteins have been implicated in a very large number of inflammatory, fibrotic and neoplastic diseases; the discovery and development of orally active galectin inhibitors would be a major step towards expanded treatment approaches for these disorders. This early drug discovery effort may lead to drugs that would expand our pipeline as follow-on compounds to our first in class galectin inhibitors, belapectin and GM-CT-01. These efforts have identified several potential compounds which are continuing to be explored to identify lead molecules that may be identified for clinical development.
Manufacturing and Marketing
 
We are a development stage Company at this time and do not intend to establish internal facilities for the manufacture of our products for clinical or commercial production. To have our products manufactured, we have developed and will continue to develop relationships with third-parties that have established pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities and expertise. We are not a party to any long-term agreement with any of our suppliers and, accordingly, we have our products manufactured on a purchase-order basis from one of two primary well-known and established pharmaceutical suppliers that meet FDA requirements. Additionally, belapectin is manufactured as a sterile liquid formulation. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, certain delays related to COVID-19 related supply issues with certain components necessary to manufacture belapectin.
 
Because our products are in the development stage, we have not created a sales and marketing staff to commercialize pharmaceutical products. If we develop products eligible for commercial sale, we will need to develop a sales and marketing capability or rely on third parties such as licensees, collaborators, joint venture partners or independent distributors to market and sell those products. Our dependence on third-party manufacturers, analytical testing and other laboratories and marketers will involve risks relating to our reduced control, and other risks including those discussed in “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Company — There are risks associated with reliance on our third parties for manufacturing, marketing, sales, managed care and distribution infrastructure channels.”
 
Competition
 
Many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are developing new technologies for the treatment of cancer, fibrotic diseases and other diseases. Technologies such as monoclonal antibodies could be competitive with our galectin therapeutic platforms. Other companies are trying to improve the therapeutic profile of widely used protein-based drugs. While these companies may broaden the market for our products they may also provide competitive alternatives to our products. We expect increased competition in the area of galectins will be fueled by a nearly exponential increase in the publication rate of research papers on galectins.
 
See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Company — We face intense competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries” for additional discussion related to our current and potential competition.
 
Government Regulation
 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, and marketing, among other things, of our products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (“NDAs”), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution.
Drug Approval Process
 
Drugs may not be marketed in the U.S. until the FDA has approved them. The steps required before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. include:

1. | Pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies,
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin,
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication,
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Submission to the FDA of a NDA,
---+--------------------------------


5. | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities, at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing procedures (“cGMP”) established by the FDA,
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | FDA review and approval of the NDA, and
---+----------------------------------------


7. | FDA review and approval of a trademark used in connection with a pharmaceutical.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as numerous in vitro and in vivo animal studies. The results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and the Company must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. There is no certainty that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and constant oversight by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 


 Index

Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Each trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), before it can begin. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into patients to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacodynamics, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to (i) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; (ii) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and (iii) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific indications. Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population. There is no assurance that these trials will be completed within a specified period of time, if at all.
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory. If the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities as acceptable, the FDA will generally issue an approval letter. If the FDA evaluates the NDA submission or the manufacturing facilities as not acceptable, the FDA will generally outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Even if an applicant submits the requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and there is no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims are subject to further FDA review and approval.
 
See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Products — We will need regulatory approvals to commercialize our products” for additional discussion of regulatory risks related to our drug development program.
 
FDA Priority Review
 
FDA procedures provide for priority review of an NDA submitted for drugs that, compared to currently marketed products, offer a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a disease. NDAs that are granted priority review are acted upon more quickly than NDAs given standard review. If we were to seek priority review, there can be no guarantee that the FDA will grant priority review status, that priority review status will affect the time of review, or that the FDA will approve the NDA submitted for any of our product candidates, whether or not priority review status is granted.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
If FDA approval of one or more of our products is obtained, we will be required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements. For example, holders of an approved NDA are required to report certain adverse reactions to the FDA and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Also, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 
Regulation Outside the United States
 
Before our products can be marketed outside of the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval similar to that required in the United States, although the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. No assurance can be given that even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices will be approved for such product.
Environmental Regulation
 
Pharmaceutical research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies must comply with laws and regulations governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. We do not anticipate building in-house research, development or manufacturing facilities, and, accordingly, do not expect to have to comply directly with environmental regulation. However, our contractors and others conducting research, development or manufacturing activities for us may be required to incur significant compliance cost, and this could in turn could increase our expense or delay our completion of research or manufacturing programs.
Human Capital Resources
 
As of February 28, 2023, we currently have twelve full-time employees, nine of whom are involved primarily in management of our pre-clinical research and development and clinical trials and three who were involved primarily in management and administration of our Company. We also utilize several contractors and consultants who provide product development, manufacture, analytical testing, clinical trial expertise, and clinical trial support.
