ITEM 1.    Business.
General
Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” in this Form 10-K refer to Guess?, Inc. (“GUESS?”) and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
We design, market, distribute and license one of the world’s leading lifestyle collections of contemporary apparel and accessories for men, women and children that reflect the American lifestyle and European fashion sensibilities. Our apparel is marketed under numerous trademarks including GUESS, GUESS?, GUESS U.S.A., GUESS Jeans, GUESS? and Triangle Design, MARCIANO, Question Mark and Triangle Design, a stylized G and a stylized M, GUESS Kids, Baby GUESS, YES, G by GUESS (GbG), GUESS by MARCIANO and Gc. The lines include full collections of clothing, including jeans, pants, skirts, dresses, activewear, shorts, blouses, shirts, jackets, knitwear and intimate apparel. In addition, we selectively grant licenses to design, manufacture and distribute a broad range of products that complement our apparel lines, including eyewear, watches, handbags, footwear, kids’ and infants’ apparel, outerwear, fragrance, jewelry and other fashion accessories. We also grant licenses to certain wholesale partners to operate and sell our products through licensed retail stores. 
Our products are sold through direct-to-consumer, wholesale and licensing distribution channels. Our core customers are style-conscious consumers comprised of three target consumer groups: Heritage, Millennials and Generation Z. Our Heritage customers, typically aged 40 years and older, are very loyal and have been shopping with us for years. We appeal to these customers through GUESS and specialty product lines that include MARCIANO, a more sophisticated fashion line targeted to women and men. Our Millennial customers are typically between the ages of 25 to 39 and Generation Z customers are typically between the ages of 10 to 24 years old. These two target consumer groups shop streetwear and vintage inspired trends, viewing GUESS as accessible luxury. 
We were founded in 1981 and currently operate as a Delaware corporation.
We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year calendar, which ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31 of each year. All references herein to “fiscal 2023,” “fiscal 2022,” and “fiscal 2021” represent the results of the 52-week fiscal years ended January 28, 2023, January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021. References to “fiscal 2024” represent the 53-week fiscal year ending February 3, 2024.
Business Strengths
We believe we have several business strengths that set us apart from our competition, including:
Brand Equity.   The GUESS? brand is an integral part of our business, a significant strategic asset and a primary source of sustainable competitive advantage. The GUESS? brand communicates a distinctive image that is fun, fashionable and sexy. We have developed and maintained this image worldwide through our consistent emphasis on innovative and distinctive product designs and through our award-winning advertising, under the creative leadership and vision of Paul Marciano, our Chief Creative Officer and Director. Brand loyalty, name awareness, perceived quality, strong brand images, public relations, publicity, promotional events and trademarks all contribute to the reputation and integrity of the GUESS? brand.
Global Diversification.   The global success of the GUESS? brand has reduced our reliance on any particular geographic region. This geographic diversification provides broad opportunities for long-term growth, even during regional economic slowdowns. The percentage of our revenue generated from outside of the U.S. has grown from approximately 32% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005 to approximately 74% of our total revenues for the year ended January 28, 2023. As of January 28, 2023, we directly operated 1,046 retail stores in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our partners operated 562 additional retail stores worldwide. As of January 28, 2023, we and our partners operated in approximately 100 countries worldwide. We continue to evaluate the different businesses in our global portfolio, directing capital investments to those with more profit potential.
Multiple Distribution Channels.   We use direct-to-consumer, wholesale and licensing distribution channels to sell our products globally. This allows us to maintain a critical balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single channel. The use of multiple channels also allows us to adapt quickly to changes in the distribution environment in any particular region.
Direct-to-Consumer.   Our direct-to-consumer network is omni-channel, made up of both directly operated brick-and-mortar retail stores and concessions as well as integrated e-commerce sites that create a seamless shopping experience for our customers.
Directly operated retail stores and concessions.   Distribution through our directly operated retail stores and concessions allows us to influence the merchandising and presentation of our products, enhance our brand image, build brand equity and test new product design concepts. Our store locations vary country by country depending on the type of locations available. In general, our stores average approximately 4,900 square feet in the Americas, approximately 2,600 square feet in Europe and the Middle East and approximately 2,400 square feet in Asia and the Pacific. Concessions generally average 1,100 square feet and are located primarily in South Korea and Greater China. As part of our omni-channel initiative, retail store sales in certain regions may be fulfilled from one of our numerous retail store locations or from our distribution centers.
Our directly operated retail stores and concessions were: 

 | Year Ended 
 | Jan 28, 2023 | Jan 29, 2022 | | Jan 30, 2021
Region | Stores | Concessions | | Stores | Concessions | Stores | | Concessions

Total | 1,046 | | 212 | | 1,068 | | 178 | | 1,046 | 172

e-Commerce.   As of January 28, 2023, we operated retail websites in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We have e-commerce available to 50 countries and in 13 languages around the world. Our websites act as virtual storefronts that both sell our products and promote our brands. Designed as customer shopping centers, these sites showcase our products in an easy-to-navigate format, allowing customers to see and purchase our collections of apparel and accessories. These virtual stores have not only expanded our direct-to-consumer distribution channel, but they have also improved customer relations and are fun and entertaining alternative-shopping environments. As part of our omni-channel initiative, e-commerce orders in certain regions may be fulfilled from our distribution centers, or from our retail stores, or both. 
Wholesale Distribution.   We sell through both domestic and international wholesale distribution channels as well as retail stores and concessions operated by certain wholesale partners. 
Wholesale.   In Europe, our products are sold in stores ranging from large, well-known department stores like El Corte Inglès, Galeries Lafayette and Printemps to small upscale multi-brand boutiques. Because our European wholesale business is more fragmented, we generally rely on a large number of smaller regional distributors and agents to distribute our products. In the Americas, our wholesale customers consist primarily of department stores, including Macy’s, Liverpool and Hudson’s Bay, and select specialty retailers and upscale boutiques, which have the image and merchandising expertise that we require for the effective presentation of our products. Through our foreign subsidiaries and our network of international distributors, our products are also available in major cities throughout Africa, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.
Licensed stores and concessions.   We also sell product to retail partners who operate licensed retail stores and concessions, which allows us to expand our international operations with a lower level of capital investment while still closely monitoring store development and merchandise programs and marketing activations in order to protect the integrity of the GUESS? brand.
Licensed retail stores and concessions operated by our retail partners were:

Total | 562 | | 121 | | 563 | | 159 | | 524 | 204

Licensing Operations.   The desirability of the GUESS? brand name among consumers has allowed us to selectively expand our product offerings and global markets through trademark licensing arrangements, with minimal capital investment or on-going operating expenses. We currently have various domestic and international licenses that include eyewear, watches, handbags, footwear, kids’ and infants’ apparel, outerwear, undergarments and sleepwear, fragrance, jewelry and other fashion accessories; and include licenses for the design, manufacture and distribution of GUESS? branded products in markets which include Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Central America, North America and South America. 
Multiple Store Concepts.   Our products are sold around the world primarily through six different store concepts, namely our GUESS? full-price retail stores, our GUESS? factory outlet stores, our GUESS? Accessories stores, our G by GUESS (GbG) stores, our MARCIANO stores and our GUESS? Kids stores. During fiscal 2021, we integrated our G by GUESS brand into our Factory business over time in order to drive further efficiencies. We and our partners also have a small number of underwear, Gc watch and footwear concept stores. This allows us to target the various demographics in each region through dedicated store concepts that market each brand or concept specifically to the desired customer population. Having multiple store concepts also allows us to target our newer brands and concepts in different markets than our flagship GUESS? store concept.
Business Segments
Our businesses are grouped into five reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: Americas Retail, Americas Wholesale, Europe, Asia and Licensing. The Americas Retail segment includes our retail and e-commerce operations in the Americas. The Americas Wholesale segment includes our wholesale operations in the Americas. The Europe segment includes our retail, e-commerce and wholesale operations in Europe and the Middle East. The Asia segment includes our retail, e-commerce and wholesale operations in Asia and the Pacific. The Licensing segment includes our worldwide licensing operations. Refer to “Part IV. Financial Statements – Note 17 – Segment Information” in this Form 10-K for disclosures about our segment financial information.
Americas Retail Segment
In our Americas Retail segment, we sell our products direct-to-consumer through a network of directly operated retail and factory outlet stores and e-commerce sites in the Americas. 
Retail stores and concessions.   Our Americas Retail stores and concessions are comprised of a mix of GUESS? retail stores, GUESS? factory outlet stores, G by GUESS (GbG) stores, GUESS? Accessories stores and MARCIANO stores. During fiscal 2021, we integrated our G by GUESS brand into our Factory business over time in order to drive further efficiencies. During fiscal 2023, we opened 11 new stores and closed 28 stores in the Americas, ending the year with 371 stores. This store count does not include 29 concessions in Mexico. We directly operated our retail stores and concessions in Mexico and Brazil through our majority-owned joint ventures. 
e-Commerce.   Our Americas Retail segment also includes our directly operated retail and other marketplace websites in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Brazil. These websites operate as virtual storefronts that, combined with our retail stores, provide a seamless shopping experience to the consumer to sell our products and promote our brands. They also provide information about fashion trends and a mechanism for customer feedback while promoting customer loyalty and enhancing our brand identity through interactive content online and through smartphone applications. Our U.S. and Canadian online sites are fully integrated 
with our customer relationship management (“CRM”) system and loyalty programs. Omni-channel initiatives that we have already deployed in the U.S. and Canada include “buy online, pick-up in stores” or “buy online, return in stores” and “order from store” as well as mobile-optimized commerce sites and smartphone applications. In the U.S. and Canada, e-commerce orders may be fulfilled from our distribution centers, or from our retail stores, or both. 
Americas Wholesale Segment
In our Americas Wholesale segment, we sell our products through wholesale channels throughout the Americas and to third-party distributors based in Central and South America as well as licensed retail locations operated by our wholesale partners. Our Americas Wholesale business generally experiences stronger performance from July through November. Our Americas Wholesale customers consist primarily of department stores, select specialty retailers, upscale boutiques as well as select off-price retailers. Our products were sold to consumers through approximately 1,450 major doors in the Americas, as well as through our customers’ e-commerce sites, as of both January 28, 2023 and January 29, 2022. As of January 28, 2023, these locations included approximately 700 “shop-in-shops”—designated selling areas within a department store—offering a wide array of our products and incorporating GUESS? signage and fixture designs. These shop-in-shops, managed by the department stores, allow us to reinforce the GUESS? brand image with our customers. Many department stores have more than one shop-in-shop, with each one featuring women’s, men’s or kids’ apparel or handbags. We also sell product to licensed retail stores and concessions operated by certain wholesale customers. As of January 28, 2023, we had 34 licensed retail stores in the Americas, all of which were located in Central and South America. 
Our Americas Wholesale merchandising strategy is to focus on trend-right products supported by key fashion basics. We have sales representatives in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Montreal, Mexico City and Vancouver who coordinate with customers to determine the inventory level and product mix that should be carried in each store. Additionally, we use merchandise coordinators who work with the stores to ensure that our products are displayed appropriately. During fiscal 2023, our two largest wholesale customers accounted for a total of approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenue.
Europe Segment
In our Europe segment, we sell our products through direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels throughout Europe and the Middle East.
European Direct-to-Consumer.   Our European direct-to-consumer network is comprised of brick-and-mortar retail stores and concessions and e-commerce sites.
Retail stores and concessions.   Our European retail stores and concessions are primarily comprised of a mix of directly operated GUESS? retail and outlet stores, MARCIANO retail stores, GUESS? Accessories retail and outlet stores, GUESS? Footwear stores and GUESS? Kids stores. During fiscal 2023, we opened 46 new stores and closed 42 stores, ending the year with 560 directly operated stores in Europe and the Middle East. This store count does not include 54 directly operated concessions in Europe. Certain of our European stores require initial investments in the form of key money to secure prime store locations. These amounts are paid to landlords or existing lessees in certain circumstances.
e-Commerce.   Our Europe segment also includes our directly operated retail and other marketplace websites. In Europe, similar to the Americas, our e-commerce sites operate as virtual storefronts that, combined with our retail stores, provide a seamless shopping experience to the consumer to sell our products and promote our brands. We have deployed omni-channel initiatives in our European markets, including “buy online, ship from store” and “buy in store, deliver by e-commerce.” We currently offer interactive content online and via mobile, and are planning to expand to smartphone applications.
European Wholesale Distribution.   We sell our products both through wholesale distribution channels and through licensed retail stores and concessions operated by our wholesale partners throughout Europe and the Middle East. Our European wholesale business generally relies on a large number of smaller regional distributors and agents to distribute our products primarily to smaller independent multi-
brand boutiques. Our products are also sold directly to large, well-known department stores like El Corte Inglès, Galeries Lafayette and Printemps. The type of customer varies from region to region depending on both the prominence of the GUESS? brand in each region and the dominance of a particular type of retail channel in each region. In countries where the brand is well known, we operate through showrooms where agents and distributors can view our line and place orders. We currently have showrooms in key cities such as Barcelona, Düsseldorf, Lugano, Munich, Paris, Lisbon, Florence, Moscow and Warsaw. We sell both our apparel and certain accessories products under our GUESS? and MARCIANO brand concepts through our wholesale channel, operating primarily through two seasons, Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter. Generally, our Spring/Summer sales campaign is from April to September with the related shipments occurring primarily from November to April. The Fall/Winter sales campaign is from November to April with the related shipments occurring primarily from May to October. We may take advantage of early-season demand and potential reorders by offering a pre-collection assortment which ships at the beginning of each season. Customers retain the ability to request early shipment of backlog orders, delay shipments or cancel orders depending on their needs. Revenues from sales to our wholesale licensed stores are also recognized as wholesale sales within our European wholesale operations. During fiscal 2023, our partners opened 22 new licensed retail stores and closed 11 stores, ending the year with 234 licensed retail stores in Europe and the Middle East. 
Asia Segment
In our Asia segment, we sell our products through direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels throughout Asia and the Pacific.
Asian Direct-to-Consumer.   Our Asian direct-to-consumer network is comprised of brick-and-mortar retail stores and concessions and e-commerce sites. 
Retail stores and concessions.   Our Asian retail stores and concessions include a mix of directly operated GUESS?, GUESS? Footwear, GUESS? Accessories, GUESS? Kids and MARCIANO stores. During fiscal 2023, we opened 13 new stores and closed 22 stores, including stores transferred to and from our partners and other store relocations and remodels. We ended the year with 115 directly operated stores in Asia and the Pacific. This store count does not include 129 directly operated apparel and accessory concessions. Concessions are widely used in Asia and generally represent directly managed areas within a department store setting. 
e-Commerce.   We also have e-commerce sites throughout Asia which operate as virtual storefronts that, combined with our retail stores, provide a seamless shopping experience to the consumer to sell our products and promote our brands. 
Asian Wholesale Distribution.   Our Asian wholesale customer base is comprised primarily of a small number of selected distributors with which we have contractual distribution arrangements and licensed stores and concessions operated by our wholesale partners. During fiscal 2023, our partners opened 14 new licensed retail stores and closed 26 stores, including stores transferred to and from our partners and other store relocations and remodels. We ended the year with 294 licensed retail stores. This store count does not include 121 apparel and accessory concessions operated by our partners in Asia. 
Licensing Segment
Our Licensing segment includes our worldwide licensing operations. The desirability of the GUESS? brand name among consumers has allowed us to selectively expand our product offerings and global markets through trademark licensing arrangements, with minimal capital investment or on-going operating expenses. We currently have various domestic and international licenses that include eyewear, watches, handbags, footwear, kids’ and infants’ apparel, outerwear, undergarments and sleepwear, fragrance, jewelry and other fashion accessories; and include licenses for the design, manufacture and distribution of GUESS? branded products in markets which include Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, Central America, North America and South America.
Our trademark license agreements customarily provide for a multi-year initial term generally ranging from three to ten years, and may contain options to renew prior to expiration for an additional multi-year period. The typical license agreement requires that the licensee pay us the greater of a royalty based on a percentage of the licensee’s net sales of licensed products or a guaranteed annual minimum royalty that typically increases over the 
term of the license agreement. In addition, several of our key license agreements provide for specified, fixed cash rights payments over and above our normal, ongoing royalty payments. Generally, licensees are required to spend a percentage of the net sales of licensed products for advertising and promotion of the licensed products and, in many cases, we place the ads on behalf of the licensee and are reimbursed. Additionally, licensees also make contributions to advertising funds, as a percentage of their sales, or may elect to increase their contribution to support specific brand-building initiatives. 
In addition, to protect and increase the value of our trademarks, our license agreements include strict quality control and manufacturing standards. Our licensing personnel meet regularly with licensees to ensure consistency with our overall merchandising and design strategies in order to protect the GUESS? trademarks and brand. As part of this process, our licensing department reviews in advance GUESS? third-party licensed products, advertising and promotional materials.
We strategically reposition our existing licensing portfolio by monitoring and evaluating the performance of our licensees worldwide. For instance, between 2005 and 2013, we acquired several of our European apparel licensees. As a result, we now directly manage our adult and children’s apparel businesses in Europe. 
Strategic Partnerships
We evaluate opportunities for strategic acquisitions and alliances and pursue those that we believe will support and contribute to our overall strategic initiatives and/or will leverage our global infrastructure and network of licensees and wholesale partners. Similarly, when existing investments and alliances no longer align with strategic initiatives or as other circumstances warrant, we will evaluate various exit opportunities. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have majority-owned joint ventures in Brazil, the Canary Islands, Mexico, Portugal, Russia and a minority-owned joint venture in South Africa. These joint ventures allow us to accelerate expansion, revitalize certain regions, and provide enhanced development of our retail and wholesale channels in these regions. 
Design
Apparel products are designed by in-house design teams that collaborate to share ideas for products that can be sold throughout our global markets and are inspired by our GUESS? heritage. Our design teams seek to identify global fashion trends and interpret them for the style-conscious consumer while retaining the distinctive GUESS? image. They travel throughout the world in order to monitor fashion trends and discover new fabrics. These fabrics, together with the trends observed by our designers, serve as the primary source of inspiration for our lines and collections. In fiscal 2021, we developed our first ever global line of apparel products and in fiscal 2022, we developed our first ever global line across all product categories including accessories. In addition to driving efficiencies, this initiative is expected to help elevate our brand by allowing us to offer products to our customers across all markets from one line while still addressing each local market’s need. We also maintain a fashion library consisting of vintage and contemporary garments as another source of creative concepts. In addition, our design teams work closely with members of our sales, merchandising and retail operations teams to further refine our products to meet the particular needs of our markets.
Global Sourcing and Supply Chain
We source products through numerous suppliers, many of whom have established long-term relationships with us. We seek to achieve efficient and timely delivery of our products, combining global and local sourcing. Almost all of our products are acquired as full package purchases where we design and source product and the vendor delivers the finished product. 
We believe that our balanced global supply chain, with deep vendor partnerships, provides us with a competitive advantage where we have the flexibility to respond to increased demand throughout the world. We believe that our new global apparel line of products will help improve product development costs by reducing the number of styles and help drive efficiencies in product costs by consolidating orders from multiple regions. Our sourcing strategy provides us with the opportunity to leverage costs and improve speed-to-market.
As an ongoing strategic initiative, we leave a larger portion of our buys open prior to each season to improve the efficiency of our speed-to-market by allowing us to design and produce closer to market delivery. This allows us to better react to emerging fashion trends in the market. We are also continuously searching for new suppliers and sourcing opportunities in reaction to the latest trends. We have developed IT systems to capture 
and share key performance indicators with our partners to drive ongoing improvements. During fiscal 2023, we continued to tightly manage our vendor base to around 140 core suppliers. Given the global instability and challenges within the supply chain and geopolitical environment, we are building an agile and lean supply chain by identifying new suppliers that can contribute to reduce our dependency on certain countries of origin. Additionally, offering an assortment of global products continues to be an area of focus. As a global brand, we maintain skilled sourcing teams in North America, Europe and Asia.
We are committed to sourcing our products in a responsible manner, respecting both the countries in which we conduct business and the business partners that produce our products. Our global supply chain Social Responsibility program reflects our strong commitment to help our suppliers implement best practices in safe and decent work and achieve meaningful improvements in the lives of their workers. 
Our program highlights three areas—factory approvals, factory monitoring and remediation, and supplier training and education.
All directly-sourced supplier factories go through a strict approval process before being authorized to work with Guess. To support and ensure our social compliance, we communicate our expectations to our partners through our Global Suppliers Code of Conduct (“Guess CoC”), which sets the minimum requirements for all factories where Guess branded items are manufactured. Although local customs vary in different regions of the world, we believe that the issues of business ethics, human rights, health, safety and environmental stewardship transcend geographical boundaries. 
Initial assessments of compliance allow us to engage and educate new suppliers on our standards and create the groundwork for strong relationships based on continuous improvement. If deficiencies are discovered, personnel in each region are empowered to work with the respective business partner to take a corrective course of action. Additionally, the goal of this process is to educate individuals, build strategic relationships and improve business practices over the long-term. 
We also believe in a proactive educational approach, providing many types of training to factory personnel with the aim to increase their awareness of Guess CoC best practices and build compliance capacity. 
In addition, we are committed to increased sourcing of environmentally preferred materials as part of our sustainability commitments to reduce reliance on virgin raw materials, support industry innovation and best practices in land use and agriculture, and reduce waste. We are actively engaging our partners to transition to more sustainable materials, as well as to advance production processes through education.
Advertising and Marketing
Our advertising, public relations and marketing strategy is designed to promote a consistent high impact image which endures regardless of changing consumer trends. While our advertising promotes products, the primary emphasis is on brand image.
Since our inception, Paul Marciano, our Chief Creative Officer and Director, has had principal responsibility for the GUESS? brand image and creative vision. Throughout our history, we have maintained a high degree of consistency in our advertisements by using similar themes and images, including our signature black and white print advertisements and iconic logos. 
We deploy a variety of media focused on national and international contemporary fashion/beauty, lifestyle and celebrity outlets. In recent years, we have also expanded our efforts into influencer marketing, digital advertising with leading fashion and lifestyle websites and advertising on social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok and global search engines. Our smartphone applications provide a unique mobile media experience by combining fashion, e-commerce, personalized product recommendations, targeted promotions and social loyalty rewards to drive mobile brand engagement.
We also require our licensees and distributors to invest a percentage of their net sales of licensed products and net purchases of GUESS? products in Company-approved advertising, promotion and marketing. By retaining control over our advertising programs, we are able to maintain the integrity of our brands while realizing substantial cost savings compared to outside agencies.
We will continue to regularly assess and implement marketing initiatives that we believe will build brand equity and grow our business by investing in marketing programs to build awareness and drive customer traffic to our stores, websites and smartphone applications. We plan to further strengthen communications with customers through an emphasis on digital marketing, and through our websites, loyalty programs, direct catalog and marketing mailings. We also plan to strengthen communities on various social media platforms, which enable us to provide timely information in an entertaining fashion to consumers about our history, products, special events, promotions and store locations, while allowing us to receive and respond directly to customer feedback.
As part of these initiatives, we currently have loyalty programs in North America, Europe and Asia covering all of our brands. The programs are designed to reward our members by earning points for purchases that can be redeemed on future purchases either in our stores or online. In addition to earning rewards with the program, our loyalty members may receive other benefits including invitations to special VIP events in our stores, double points during their birthday month and access to seasonal savings, depending on their purchasing tier. Our Guess List loyalty program has experienced growth in its overall member engagement numbers through the introduction of experiential rewards and unique member content. The programs are also used to promote new products to our customers which in turn increases traffic in the stores and online. The loyalty programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing brands. We continue to enhance our loyalty program offerings by understanding our members’ interests and needs by strategically marketing to this large and growing customer base. 
Quality Control
Our quality control program is designed to ensure that products meet our high-quality standards. We test the quality of our raw materials prior to production and inspect prototypes of each product before production runs commence. We also perform random in-line quality control checks during and after production before the garments leave the contractor. Final random inspections occur when the garments are received in our distribution centers. We believe that our policy of inspecting our products is important to maintain the quality, consistency and reputation of our products. We have an on-site quality assurance collaboration with an external expert provider for a large portion of our European and North American purchase orders. During fiscal 2023, we continued to expand the program for additional purchase orders in Europe and North America. The objective is to stop product quality issues at the origin before investing in the transportation of the goods to the final destinations.
Product Integrity and Testing Protocol
During fiscal 2023, we published new protocols covering all our major regions, which provide minimum product integrity and other testing for apparel, footwear, accessories and handbags to help ensure our products continue to meet or exceed our customers’ expectations.
Logistics
We utilize distribution centers at strategically located sites. Our U.S. distribution center is based in Louisville, Kentucky, where we use fully integrated and automated distribution systems. The bar code scanning of merchandise and distribution cartons, together with radio frequency communications, provide timely, controlled, accurate and instantaneous updates to our distribution information systems. Additionally, the U.S. business is partnered with Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“CTPAT”), which expedites movement of goods into our U.S. trade lanes. We have been CTPAT certified for several years, and complete our recertification annually.
Distribution of our products in Canada is handled primarily from our operated distribution centers in Montreal, Quebec. In Europe, distribution of our products is handled primarily by third-party distributors through distribution facilities in Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. We also utilize smaller distribution facilities throughout Europe. We utilize several third-party operated distribution warehouses that service the Asia region.
Competition
The apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented and is subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and preferences. We believe that our success depends in large part upon our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in a timely manner and upon the continued appeal to consumers of the GUESS? brand. We compete with numerous apparel retailers, manufacturers and distributors, both domestically and internationally, as well as several well-known designers. Our licensed apparel and 
accessories also compete with a substantial number of well-known brands. Although the level and nature of competition differs among our product categories and geographic regions, we believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by offering a global lifestyle brand on the basis of our global brand image and wide product assortment comprising both apparel and accessories. We also believe that our geographic diversification, multiple distribution channels and multiple store concepts help to set us apart from our competition.
Information Systems
We believe that high levels of automation and technology are essential to maintain our competitive position and support our strategic objectives. We continue to invest in new technologies and update computer hardware, network infrastructure, system applications and cyber-security. Our computer information systems consist of a full range of financial, distribution, merchandising, point-of-sales, customer relationship management, supply chain, digital platform, enterprise resource planning and other systems. During fiscal 2023, we improved and stabilized our digital platforms, implemented more payment methods, continued to improve our web front, expanded our shopping channels, enhanced our omni-channel experience and continued to develop mobile-based initiatives to support our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses. We completed store infrastructure upgrades, including in-store Wi-Fi for customer access, in preparation for the adoption of new technology and continued to improve upon mobile point of sale check out, Salesforce Customer 360, endless aisle, and real time inventory and sales dashboard. We have implemented a more advanced inventory planning and allocation tool in Europe and are rolling out to other regions for more accurate inventory management. During fiscal 2023, in order to accommodate company global operation and business continuity initiatives, we also upgraded our network infrastructure globally to have a seamless global office, and improved our disaster recovery process. We are also continuing to enhance our product life cycle management and supply chain tracking system and to enhance and align our IT standards globally to accommodate future growth and provide operational efficiencies.

We consider our trademarks to have significant value in the marketing of our products and act aggressively to register and protect our trademarks worldwide.
Like many well-known brands, our trademarks are subject to infringement. We have staff devoted to the monitoring and aggressive protection of our trademarks worldwide.
Seasonality
Our business is impacted by the general seasonal trends characteristic of the apparel and retail industries. The retail operations in the Americas and Europe are generally stronger during the second half of the fiscal year, and the wholesale operations in the Americas generally experience stronger performance from July through November. The European wholesale businesses operate with two primary selling seasons: the Spring/Summer season, which ships from November to April and the Fall/Winter season, which ships from May to October. We may take advantage of early-season demand and potential reorders in our European wholesale business by offering a pre-collection assortment which ships at the beginning of each season. Customers retain the ability to request early shipment of backlog orders or delay shipment of orders depending on their needs. 
Human Capital
Since our founding, we have been a company that welcomes all, both within our own operations and in our supply chain. As of January 28, 2023, with an inclusive culture and a commitment to empowering our people, we provide opportunities for approximately 12,500 associates, both full and part-time, consisting of approximately 4,500 in the U.S. and 8,000 internationally. From our innovative product designers and developers working behind the scenes, to our dynamic retail store associates—and everyone in between—we are committed to making sure their diverse voices are valued, ideas are elevated, and excellence is rewarded.
Celebrating Diversity and Inclusion
Our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion comes to life each day as we work together to maintain a fair and inclusive workplace. Our aim is for all GUESS? associates to feel comfortable and safe bringing their whole selves to work and contributing fully to our shared success. Building on the example set by the Marciano brothers and their belief that a diverse organization was a strong and creative one, we have embedded diversity and inclusion principles and practices throughout the Company. For over 40 years, this has created a rich, vibrant culture that respects, and benefits from, different personal attributes, backgrounds, ideas, and perspectives. Today, diversity is a key facet of our company-wide culture, informing our values, recruiting, talent development, and associate advancement, among other operations.
Our expectations of everyone at GUESS? to support a diverse and welcoming workplace are spelled out in the GUESS?, Inc. Code of Ethics. We expect all at GUESS? to promptly report and investigate concerns about possible discrimination, as appropriate, and to facilitate this, we maintain an open-door policy that fosters honest and open communication. GUESS? associates are encouraged to discuss work-related concerns or issues with their manager, department head, Human Resources, or Executive Management without fear of repercussion. In addition, our global whistle-blower hotline allows associates to report concerns about unethical behavior or other potential conflicts.
Cultivating Diversity, Equity, and Belonging through Focused Council
In 2018, we launched our Diversity & Inclusion Council (the “Council”), which is integrated throughout our business. The Council aims to foster a workplace in which employees enjoy a sense of community, belonging, and opportunity for dialogue. The Council also serves as a resource for internal associates, offers guidance on communication and community engagement, and assists with communication with Executive Management and the GUESS?, Inc. Board of Directors.
With the help of the Council, our diversity and inclusion efforts focus on inclusive leadership, employee training, and a work environment that promotes growth and opportunity for all. Initiatives include training for associates and managers, community support, greater diversity in advertising and marketing, celebrations of multicultural and inclusive holidays, and training and compliance programs in our supply chain, among others.
Learning and Development
We are committed to the growth and development of our employees and offer a wide range of training programs for all levels. In addition to receiving ongoing on-the-job training and coaching, our employees can build skills and prepare for the future through our HR training portal. In fiscal 2023, we continued to add new courses and trainings, many of which focus on remote working skills, as well as diversity and inclusion education. We also support learning beyond our walls through our tuition assistance program. These collective learning and development programs help foster career mobility for our employees, while simultaneously allowing us to fill open positions with existing employees who know our company best.
Employee Safety and Well-Being
We are committed to the safety, health, and overall well-being of each of our employees and their families, providing a wide array of physical, emotional and social support. Our GUESS Wellness 360 online portal offers our employees physical and mental wellness support using challenges, contests, and prizes.
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of all of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate around the world. In this regard, we have implemented new health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices, with several locations offering free COVID-19 testing and vaccinations. 
Compensation and Benefits
We are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce. We are also committed to maintaining pay equity throughout our organization, conducting annual assessments. We offer a wide array of both employer-paid and employee-paid benefits to support our employees' overall financial, physical, and mental well-being, including, but not limited to, healthcare, retirement savings, paid time off, temporary leave, and flexible work arrangements. We also provide our employees a merchandise discount on most of our products. 
Sustainability and Climate Change
In fiscal 2022, we released our latest sustainability report entitled VISION GUESS, our fourth sustainability report covering fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021, written in accordance with standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) and Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”). The publication of VISION GUESS is a milestone achievement for us, marking the successful completion of a reasonable assurance engagement examining the metrics and disclosures in this sustainability report.
The sustainability report shares our significant progress on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics since our first sustainability plan launched in 2016. The sustainability report also provides information about our current and future activities which includes, among others, reducing greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions with Science Based Targets, transitioning to more sustainable and recycled materials, and continuing our commitment to circular fashion. 
The VISION GUESS Sustainability report is available at http://sustainability.guess.com. We plan to release our next sustainability report in summer 2023, covering fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, which will also be available on our website at the foregoing link. This site provides information on our policies, social impact and environmental programs, as well as our sustainability strategy, data and reporting. The information contained on, or that may be accessed through, our websites is not incorporated by reference into, and is not a part of, this Annual Report.
Strengthening Sustainability Oversight
We are committed to good governance and sustainability oversight at every level, ethics in every business facet, and transparency in sustainability reporting. During fiscal 2023, we further engaged with the Board of Directors on ESG priorities, risks, and opportunities. We continue to ensure all operations and businesses are conducted ethically, both with internal personnel and external business partners, and all of our directors, officers, and associates are held to our Code of Ethics. 
Additionally, in the VISION GUESS sustainability plan, we committed to connecting ESG priorities with business performance incentive and evaluation metrics. Our Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility Team ensures the environmental and social responsibility is embedded into decision-making processes. In addition, we have implemented a rigorous internal auditing program, covering our sustainability metrics and performance data to ensure complete, accurate, and balanced sustainability reporting. With our continuous effort, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 marked the first time we underwent a third-party reasonable assurance examination indicating our sustainability report was prepared in accordance with the GRI and the SASB.
Protecting Our Environment
We are committed to protecting our environment and addressing climate change issues through product responsibility, water stewardship, and GHG emissions reduction. We understand sustainably sourced materials are the key to ensuring product responsibility. Lifecycle analyses have shown that fiber and fabric production make up about half of our apparel’s environmental impact. To that end, we have been working with our vendors to incorporate more sustainable materials and practices. By setting sustainability goals to increase use of responsible materials and promote circular fashion, and by following the GUESS Eco material sourcing guide, we source over 19% sustainable materials across all brands in our global portfolio.
As part of our commitment to protect our environment, we aim to ensure that animal-derived material used in our products upholds our commitment to the ethical and humane treatment of animals. Through the GUESS Animal Welfare Policy, guided by international best practice in accordance with “The Five Freedoms for Animal Welfare” by the Farm Animal Welfare Council, our suppliers are prohibited from using any fur, mohair, angora, exotic leather or any other parts from vulnerable, endangered, or wild-caught species. The use of feathers and downs or other animal derived hair is subject to limitation and use with caution. 
Historically, denim production factories require the use of many chemicals, which could impact a factory’s wastewater discharge. In fiscal 2019, we established the GUESS Water Action Plan to address each phase of the denim lifecycle to prioritize water savings and improve water quality while providing water education and community engagement. Some of our suppliers have adopted innovative technologies, including Dry Indigo®, a foam for dyeing denim a deep blue without using water and e-flow for reducing water and chemicals in the finishing process. With our commitments in adopting water-saving denim technology and managing 
environmental impacts in our supply chain, over 20% of our denim meets our GUESS Eco guidelines and approximately 60% of our key laundries completed the Higg Facility Environmental Module (“Higg FEM”) survey.
Our strategy in managing GHG emissions includes meeting our carbon footprint goals and setting Science Based Targets. In fiscal 2021, we achieved our goal from our first sustainability plan of over 15% Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity reduction per square foot from direct operations. We are now pursuing our Science Based Targets for GHG emissions, which were approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative in fiscal 2021. We remain committed to a 50% reduction of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as an ambitious reduction of absolute Scope 3 emissions by 2030. In fiscal 2022, we purchased renewable energy, solar and wind in the Americas, Europe and Asia, equivalent to power approximately 20% of our stores globally. We are replicating the same in fiscal 2023 while working on a long term strategy to reduce our GHG emissions. We will also continue implementing a variety of energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies and working with our key vendors to implement energy efficiency and renewable energy plans.
