Item 1. Business
Company Overview



FOXO seeks to modernize the life insurance industry through the application of longevity and epigenetic science. With our insurance partners, we will endeavor to improve and optimize human health span and lifespan through unique and dynamic product offerings tailored to insurance underwriters and consumers.



The convergence of two cutting-edge technologies, DNA sequencing and automated machine learning, has created what we believe is an unprecedented opportunity to reinvent the life insurance industry through modern molecular biotechnology. DNA sequencing advances now allow for the cost-effective collection of genomic and epigenomic data, while automated machine learning can identify sophisticated patterns within this data, as well as phenotypic data. These patterns are known as “epigenetic signatures,” and will provide valuable insights to insurers that will inform their underwriting and product development.



By harnessing the power of epigenetic science, we believe we can revolutionize how life insurance companies sell and underwrite their products. Our insights into consumers’ health and lifestyle choices will help insurers tailor their offerings to meet their clients’ needs and provide insurers with data to plan for their clients’ future financial needs.



We have two core product offerings: the “Underwriting Report” and the “Longevity Report™.” The Underwriting Report allows us to leverage a single assay testing process to generate a panel of impairment scores that can be applied by life insurance underwriters to more accurately assess clients during the underwriting process and provide a more personalized risk assessment. The Longevity Report is a consumer-facing companion product that provides actionable insights to consumers based on their biological age and other epigenetic measures of health. It can also be sold separately. We believe the combination of these two reports provides a valuable win for our insurance carrier partners as well as their customers.



The life insurance industry is ripe for disruption by a new underwriting protocol. Historically, when a single carrier has adopted even a single new underwriting test, others tend to follow quickly. Some examples include prescription data, smoking tests, and specimen samples. If other insurance companies do not follow quickly, they may suffer from adverse selection, and get a disproportionate number of mispriced risks. FOXO intends to leverage the combination of the Underwriting Report and the Longevity Report to change the sales and underwriting process to the betterment of consumers and carriers alike.



FOXO Labs – Underwriting Report



FOXO Labs is commercializing a first of its kind proprietary epigenetic biomarker technology to be used for mortality underwriting risk classification in the global life insurance industry (the “Underwriting Report”). The Underwriting Report provides underwriters with an alternative source of biological mortality risk factors derived from an applicant’s saliva sample. The information provided in the FOXO Underwriting Report will allow underwriters to assess mortality risk without the need for more invasive and time-consuming underwriting processes such as a paramedical exam or the procurement of medical records.



The Underwriting Report will allow insurance companies to leverage cutting-edge biotechnology that streamlines the insurance sales and underwriting process compared to the costlier and lengthier process of medical underwriting. We can administer our test using saliva allowing for a quick point-of-sale sample collection. Our non-invasive test can help insurers conduct a multi-panel risk assessment of a proposed insured and make a policy offer without the need for a paramedical exam or medical records. We believe this will (1) make policy sales more efficient and less invasive, and (2) expand the market for accelerated underwriting to higher face amount policies. By collecting a sample at the point of sale (or by mail), we will also streamline and simplify the application and underwriting process. Our multi-panel test can screen for multiple impairments using a single, non-invasive biospecimen that can be used to assess individual health risks. Additionally, as we collect more data and create more refined models we can improve our previous measures without the requirement of a new biospecimen. Thus, a saliva-based sample can be self-administered or collected by the agent without the need for a trained paramedical examiner, and the data can be updated in perpetuity as technology advances.

The Underwriting Report consists of two sections. The first one is the Biological Age Assessment, which provides an individual’s aggregate biological mortality risk. This can be used by an underwriter to quickly triage good mortality risks, which can be issued a policy immediately, from bad mortality risks, which require further underwriting to properly assess.



The core of the Biological Age Assessment is the “Biological DeltaAge,” which is the difference between biological age and chronological age. A Biological DeltaAge above zero indicates an increased mortality risk, and below zero indicates a decreased mortality risk.  



The Underwriting Report’s second section outlines specific risk factors that are intended to provide underwriters with more detailed information about an individual’s health with respect to specific impairments. Life and disability insurance underwriters can use this information to eliminate additional underwriting requirements so the insurer can focus on areas of elevated risk.



The risk factors include traditional underwriting considerations such as tobacco use, cardiovascular risk, diabetes risk, kidney disease risk, and liver disease risk as well as new information related to mortality risks such as fitness and nutrition. This information represents a significant overlap with a traditional paramedical exam; however, it is obtained through a non-invasive saliva sample instead of a blood draw and urine collection. The saliva sample can be collected by mail or by the agent at the point of sale, which eliminates the need for scheduling an appointment for a paramedical exam. These exams require fasting and a blood draw, which are additional barriers to the sale. They also need to be scheduled days or weeks in advance, delaying the underwriting process.



The Underwriting Report can be provided electronically via an application programming interface (“API”) so an insurer can integrate results into automated underwriting processes and an underwriting workbench. This allows the report to be securely transmitted and used in the way that works best for an insurer’s underwriting teams.



FOXO Life – Longevity Report



The Longevity Report provides consumers with novel information about their epigenetic makeup, along with specific insights that can help them change their behavior to live longer. The centerpiece of the Longevity Report is “FOXO Age,” which is a holistic measure of how fast an individual is aging. It is displayed on the report in comparison to the consumer’s chronological age.



The Longevity Report also includes four epigenetic health scores: (i) Metabolic, (ii) Cardiovascular, (iii) Inflammation, and (iv) Indulgence scores, which show how their environment, lifestyle, and behavior affect their health at an epigenetic level. These four epigenetic health scores enable the consumer to make important decisions about how to improve their lifestyle. Users can take tests more than once, and within each score we compare each consumer to the FOXO universe of results. This allows the consumer to review their scores in comparison to others who have received the Longevity Report. With each score, we provide personalized nutritional, lifestyle, and exercise recommendations to help consumers make lifestyle adjustments to extend their longevity. The Longevity Report is accessible through s an online dashboard that allows users to view their report as well as sample processing status, from being sent to the lab to final digital report delivery. In the future, we plan to provide consumers with a more comprehensive dashboard that identifies how they are progressing over time with their lifestyle adjustments in response to the recommendations provided with their Longevity Report scores.



FOXO is also operationalizing a sales and distribution platform focused on recruiting independent life insurance agents to sell life insurance with our Longevity Report (“FOXO Life”). FOXO Life currently markets and sells life insurance products underwritten and issued by third-party carriers through distribution relationships. This distribution model (the “MGA Model”) allows FOXO to appoint sales agents and producers to sell insurance products for specific carriers and earn commissions on subsequent policy sales. Depending on the terms of the agreement between FOXO and the carrier, the Longevity Report may be included at the time of the policy purchase at no charge or may be available at an additional cost to the consumer. We believe the Longevity Report will make longevity science a core aspect to the relationship between life insurance and consumers.



We began selling insurance products through distribution relationships with third-party carriers in the first quarter of 2023. Through our MGA Model, we earn commission revenues, marketing allowances, and service fee revenues from selling life insurance products supported by our science, technology, and brand marketing. Initially, we do not expect to use epigenetic underwriting technology in the life insurance products we sell through the MGA Model. However, we expect the research and development studies underway will support the introduction and commercialization of our saliva-based underwriting technology through our Underwriting Report in the future.

Competitive Strengths



Our Chief Science Officer, Dr. Brian Chen, is a leading expert in the field of epigenetic science. Dr. Chen manages our research and development and has played an instrumental role in demonstrating that machine learning paired with epigenetic data can provide valuable insights into human health. Our product and technical teams, led by Taylor Fay (COO) and Tyler Danielson (Interim CEO) are experienced in bringing consumer facing experiences to market in the insurance industry. Lastly, our underwriting and actuarial team is positioned to leverage our science to change the way insurance is underwritten. It is very rare to put together this combination of experts at this level all working towards a common goal. Core members of our team have been working together for over five years.



We leverage the native cloud software from Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), working with artificial intelligence (“AI”) companies like DataRobot to develop our models and deploy them securely in the best-in-class systems. Our systems and processes will be difficult for competitors to replicate as most of our systems are automated, from shipping kits to processing data from our labs and producing results for use in our reports. Our systems, through the usage of AI, is also built to continuously and autonomously develop, which makes it even more difficult to be replicated. This autonomous development includes having the AI test hundreds of models to build each predictor. We have leaders with extensive experience applying AI technologies to biological data. 



Key Value Drivers



We are modernizing the life insurance industry through a new digital technology stack designed to help us execute on our business and support our ambitious growth plans. To support our business, we have developed a technology stack that provides us with scalable operational infrastructure that offers a high degree of flexibility and adaptability in its operational software architecture. To that end, we have built a digital life insurance product services platform that will operationalize our MGA sales operations. The goal of our technology operations is to be able to service life insurance carriers worldwide, at scale. In addition, we are building operational technology that supports researchers and epigenetic analyses.



We expect that the operational software platform technology that we have developed with advanced architecture will enable us to meet our business requirements efficiently and effectively. Our operational software goal is to build a basic, modern, core operating infrastructure that enables us to service our sales, marketing, and operations across our entire platform. The platform’s operating system is substantially complete with the majority of the attentive costs associated with the build already incurred. It is built to support our saliva-based underwriting technology and consumer engagement platform, complete with saliva kit distribution and specimen tracking systems, Longevity Report production, consumer dashboard interface, and mobile application access. We expect that our operating platform will support our ability to efficiently grow at scale as we market and sell life insurance products and technology services.



We believe our product and service offerings described below allow for significant scaling at a time when we observe (i) burgeoning consumer interest in health and longevity; (ii) increased interest in life insurance due the COVID-19 pandemic; and (iii) a significant opportunity to disrupt a large, old, and slow life insurance industry with innovative applications of fast-moving modern technology. We believe our products and services can help reverse a general decline in household ownership of life insurance in the United States by providing a simplified pathway to purchase life insurance with longevity-focused products that re-establish their relevance with consumers and restore life insurance as a tool for greater social good.



Together, we believe our operating systems comprise a technology innovation stack that makes FOXO capable of scaling to support the demand it expects to receive from the products and services it intends to sell worldwide. Whether running 1,000 saliva-tests or 10,000,000, we believe the design of our operating platform and underlying systems will allow them to be highly scalable — and as a result we expect to be able to address accelerating demand in large and growing markets. In addition, as demand and volume of our saliva-based underwriting technology services scale, we expect to be able to realize significant cost savings across our platforms on the raw material inputs involved in providing our services. Our technology stack is supported by what we believe are best-in-class no-code software and cloud computing platforms.



We have also built a number of technologies that support researchers and epigenetic science and analysis. Extending our technology to researchers in longevity science is a key initiative of our business. We are supporting longevity science in a number of ways including the development of our MethylSuite, which is a high throughput bioinformatics software package that supports calculating, reporting and interpreting epigenetic data derived from microarray technology; and the Infinium Mouse Methylation Array, a new microarray designed to advance epigenetic research in model organisms.



Privacy and Security



FOXO Technologies is entrusted with highly personal data and is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its customers and organization. Protection and access to company data is the keystone of the cybersecurity strategy and is considered the utmost of business requirements.

FOXO uses the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) as its guidepost for data protection practices and continues to monitor emerging U.S. laws.



FOXO’s security program is built on the following key success factors: tightly controlled access management based on least-privilege authorization, layered defenses, continuous monitoring, vulnerability testing, rapid response, internal and supply chain risk management, strong executive support, and regular development of a security culture. Integration of our compliance command center tool enables continuous monitoring of policy and practices covering service organization control 2 (“SOC 2”) compliance.



Protecting data privacy and security is an organizational-wide responsibility. We protect customer data with a variety of processes and monitoring tools, such as:




● | Access control is tightly managed with single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, and sensitive data access limited by least-privilege authorization appropriate for job duties and reviewed quarterly.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Internal Risk Assessments are performed quarterly to identify areas of risk to mitigate or eliminate to improve security.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supply chain risk is being evaluated in an ongoing manner with our comprehensive Third-Party Risk Management program. We use a variety of tools to monitor key Software as a Service (“SaaS”) provider’s security positions as well as regular Risk Assessment questionnaires and evaluations.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Security is an ongoing focus with continuous improvement to strengthen our security posture, strengthen data protection, eliminate gaps, and expand our security-as-a-culture. We are completing our control compliance development in preparation for our initial SOC 2 Type II audit. Having a SOC 2 Report will improve our ability to sell to large organizations and attest to our use of best practices for protecting sensitive data. SOC 2 compliant policies, procedures, and controls will make it easier to achieve other security certifications, further increasing customer confidence in FOXO security.



Intellectual Property



Our approach to intellectual property is guided by the following strategic guidelines: create proprietary intellectual property that adds value, credibility, and competitive advantage; file patents, if possible; and protect our intellectual property as trade-secrets where meaningful patent protection cannot be achieved.
Proprietary Intellectual Property



We currently maintain and will continue to create significant trade-secret intellectual property regarding epigenetic biomarker technology. We work with patent attorneys with particular expertise in the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and biotechnology to file patent applications for our inventions where it furthers the protection of our intellectual property. The Pilot Study, as defined below, serves as the basis of our current proprietary intellectual property assets (trade-secrets and patent claims). Our patent applications are based on the use of machine learning for epigenetic biomarker identification, the application of epigenetics for underwriting risk classification, and synthetic DNA methylation prediction. The following patent applications were filed in the United States only with a non-publication request to prolong confidentiality and allow for an option to abandon one or more in favor of trade secret protection: 

● | Patent Application USAN 16/579,777: “A Machine Learning Model Trained to Classify Risk Using DNA Epigenetic Data” (filed September 23, 2019).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Application USAN 16/579,818: “A Machine Learning Model Trained to Determine Biochemical State and/or Medical Condition Using DNA Epigenetic Data” (filed September 23, 2019).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Application USAN 16/591,296: “Synthetic Probe” (filed October 2, 2019).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A further patent application will be published in due course: Patent Application USAN 17/482,405: “Machine Learned Quality Control for Epigenetic Data” (filed September 22, 2021). 



Licensed Intellectual Property



We have licensed “epigenetic clock” patent applications from UCLA for use in the life insurance industry. These licenses require us to achieve certain milestones and pay royalties for the commercial use of the technologies. We intend to continue to pursue licensed technology where we believe such technology adds value to our products or services. Our licensed technology includes:

● | Patent Application USAN 16/323,490 entitled “DNA Methylation Based Predictor of Mortality” (aka “DNAm Age”, “EEAA”, “Horvath Clock”) (filed February 5, 2019).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Application USAN 17/282,318 entitled “DNA Methylation Biomarker of Aging for Human Ex Vivo and In Vivo Studies” (aka “GrimAge”) (filed April 1, 2021).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Application USAN 16/963,065 entitled “Phenotypic Age and DNA Methylation Based Biomarkers for Life Expectancy and Morbidity” (aka “PhenoAge”) (filed July 17, 2020).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Opportunity



In 2019, we completed a pilot study that sought to measure a wide range of health and wellness factors used in traditional life insurance underwriting with DNA methylation data derived from blood and saliva (the “Pilot Study”). The Pilot Study began after we concluded market research to inform the product-market fit of combining longevity science with life insurance. Starting in 2018, we initiated market research to begin working with creative marketing assets to engage agents and consumers. Our market research included renting a retail storefront in the downtown Minneapolis skyway where we constructed and operated a consumer “learning laboratory.” We used this learning laboratory to recruit participants for our Pilot Study, host events, post social media content, a podcast, and hold learning seminars. This market research allowed us to develop our consumer value proposition, which includes a full range of benefits to support healthy longevity. The learning laboratory taught us that our value proposition appealed most to consumers who were tech-savvy, forward-thinking, open-minded, and in the market for life insurance. In addition, we found that consumers were much more interested in life insurance when we included their longevity as part of the product purchasing experience. Key learnings from our marketing research included:

● | 75% of visitors reported they would buy life insurance that included molecular health and wellness insights;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 47% reported they would purchase our life insurance offering even if it were more expensive;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 44% of visitors reported that they had purchased life insurance;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | 38% of visitors reported that they purchased life insurance when they first got married;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | younger consumers, aged 40 and younger, were the most engaged demographic participating in events, social media, site traffic, and consumer surveys; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | older consumers, aged 45 and older, had the most questions about their data and privacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In 2019, we engaged an insurance industry-leading consultancy to conduct additional market research beyond our Pilot Study to further confirm our product-market fit hypothesis with agents and consumers. In 2020, the overwhelming conclusion from the market research study was that the proposition of bundling molecular health and wellness with life insurance and a saliva-based underwriting protocol was “incredibly strong.”



The market research itself consisted of surveying 500 consumers and 125 agents with a 20-minute online survey designed to gather feedback on our value propositions. The objectives of the consumer survey were to measure and rank interest in, and general propensity to pay for (or otherwise perceive distinct or differentiated value in), a life insurance product offering that provides direct consumer benefits around individualized health and wellness information and aging. Key results from the research include:




● | agents surveyed highlighted the pain point of medical underwriting — and believed that the carrier who supports and embraces saliva-based underwriting technology stands to “win all the business;”;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 68% of consumers surveyed indicated they were either excited, motivated, or interested in their individualized health and wellness information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there was a high level of perceived value in receiving health and wellness information, particularly with agents;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






5








● | the impact of bundling the health and wellness value proposition had the immediate effect of moving almost 10% of consumers from non-purchasers of life insurance to prospective purchasers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 58% of consumers who indicated they had an interest in purchasing life insurance in the next two years preferred the FOXO Life concept over life insurance that did not include health and wellness information.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Overall, we believe our market research further confirms our product-market-fit hypothesis that longevity science bundled with life insurance will have an immediate and strong appeal to consumers and agents alike. In addition, our market research indicates that a saliva-based underwriting protocol that replaces the need for blood and urine specimen collection will be a highly desired offering. The results from our market research have informed our go-to-market and business development strategy.



Competition



We will encounter significant competition in the life insurance and molecular health and wellness testing business. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have significantly greater access to capital markets. Moreover, some of these competitors have significant cash reserves and can better fund shortfalls in collections that might have a more pronounced impact on companies such as FOXO. They also likely have a greater market share. In addition, we compete against other companies seeking to commercialize epigenetic biomarker underwriting technology, both within the insurance industry, as well as in other applications in other markets. In the event that the life insurance companies make a significant effort to compete against our business, we would experience significant challenges to our business model.



Competition can take many forms, including the pricing of the financing, transaction structuring, timeliness, and responsiveness in processing a seller’s application and customer service. Some of the competitors may outperform us in these areas. Some competitors target the same type of life insurance clients as we do and generally have operated in the markets for a longer period of time than us. Increased competition may result in increased costs of issuing policies through our MGAs, or it may affect the availability and quality of policies that are available for issuance through our MGAs. These factors could adversely affect our profitability by reducing our return on investment or increasing our risk. 



Research & Development



Consumer interest in health and wellness is at an all-time high. This excitement is partly spurred by recent advances in fields such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and longevity science. We want tools that arm our users with valuable insights about their own health and wellness. We have developed and innovated on a number of biomarkers to help us achieve this for our consumers.
Predictive Biomarkers



Many clinical biomarkers represent indicators of chronic disease conditions. Oftentimes, by the time the chronic disease sets in, the opportunity for prevention has long passed. Providing early indicators of health trajectories at a molecular scale may provide novel personalized insights into health before the onset of chronic disease. By, first, bringing awareness to a potential health issue before it arises, we believe small lifestyle interventions early on can prevent or slow the development of chronic conditions. Molecular biomarkers through the use of epigenetics may serve as a means to identify more subtle changes in health at a molecular level.



In order to identify subtle changes in epigenetic patterning at the early stages of the development of chronic diseases, one must leverage long-standing longitudinal datasets that have obtained biospecimens from a large number of individuals, then followed those individuals for decades to observe who developed chronic diseases. Then one may examine the epigenetic patterns of those who never developed chronic diseases and compare their epigenetic patterns to those who developed specific chronic diseases. Such a study cannot be easily conducted in modern biobanks because of the lack of longitudinal health data on individuals, especially over decades of time – most biobanks are fairly new.



We have completed the acquisition of epigenetic data through Harvard University’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital Physicians’ Health Study ("PHS”) in a longitudinal cohort of over 10,000 individuals. Based on our knowledge of published reports and industry knowledge, we believe this represents one of the largest epigenetic datasets in the world, particularly one with longitudinal health data spanning decades.  We plan to initiate research collaborations with external scientists at major research institutions to accelerate the discovery of predictive epigenetic biomarkers. Due to bandwidth limitations, we believe the advantage of this approach is that it accelerates the time to discover and bring new products to market by making the data more widely available to a larger number of world-class researchers. Furthermore, limited-to-no additional capital will be needed in the next quarter for this effort as we have completed the milestone payments related to this research study. 



Biomarkers with Proven Responses



The key to biotech products that work in real-world scenarios is rigorous science in both the development and validation of each technology. Because consumers are demanding tools that provide real-time feedback on the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions, ultimately, large randomized trials are needed to validate the technology.



In collaboration with a large academic research institution, we completed generating epigenetic data in randomized controlled trials that tested the effects of vitamin D3, omega-3 fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid (“EPA”) + docosahexaenoic acid (“DHA”)), multivitamin, vitamin E, and vitamin C. The rich longitudinal health data with the epigenetic data that we generated are ripe for the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) to identify subtle molecular indicators of salutary changes. The value of a more “sensitive” indicator of health changes is that you may not have to wait weeks or months before knowing if a certain intervention is effective for you. Such epigenetic biomarkers may allow rapid “n-of-1” (i.e., personalized health) testing of a number of interventions providing more personalized health regimens to people.





6







Strategically, we also plan to accelerate discovery by leveraging research collaborations with world-class scientists at major research institutions. And, since the data has already been generated, no further capital is needed for the initial phase of analysis.



Government Regulation



The life insurance and direct-to-consumer testing business is highly regulated at both the federal and state levels. We are subject to federal and state regulation and supervision in the life insurance business. As described below, there are significant regulations in many states that require us to obtain specific licenses or approvals to be able to sell life insurance in those states. We continually research and monitor the regulatory environment and regulatory changes that may apply to our business and intend to apply for the appropriate licenses in the required states, if such licenses are necessary, both federally and at the state level. We plan to provide our products and services under a distributed testing mode with separated “dry” and “wet” labs, with FOXO Labs analyzing epigenetic biomarkers based on data from outsourced testing performed by its partner “wet” lab. Risks related to regulation are detailed in the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Life Insurance Operations.”
Insurance Regulation — Insurance Products 



The operations of FOXO Life activities, including working with licensed insurance agents, are subject to a complex, state-by-state regulatory framework that includes company and producer licensing requirements, life insurance product regulation, financial regulation, and/or market conduct regulation. Many of these regulations are based upon the NAIC Model Rules, a set of laws, regulations, and guidelines promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners as proposed statements of insurance law to be adopted by the 50 states. The inclusion of our planned Longevity Report with the sale of life insurance is consistent with other life insurance consumer health and engagement models that are well established in the marketplace. FOXO Life does not expect significant regulatory hurdles for bundling or marketing molecular health and wellness with life insurance.
Insurance Regulation — Epigenetic Biomarkers



Underwriting life insurance is subject to state insurance regulation. We believe the use of epigenetic biomarkers in life insurance underwriting is permissible due to the fact that we are seeking to identify similar underwriting impairments already used by other insurance carriers in medical underwriting today. Moreover, the use of epigenetic testing or information in life insurance underwriting is not prohibited at either the federal or state level. Florida and Louisiana are the only states that have explicitly sought to prohibit the use of genetic information, which is distinguishable from epigenetic information, for use in life insurance underwriting.



Any adverse change in current laws or regulations, or their interpretation, federally or in one or more states in which we operate or plan to operate (or an aggregation of states in which we conduct a significant amount of business) could result in our curtailment or termination of operations in such states, or cause us to not start or modify our operations in a manner that adversely affects our ultimate profitability. Any such action could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, primarily through a material decrease in revenues, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.



Human Testing Services — Consumer Engagement and Underwriting



Conducting human testing is subject to state and federal regulation. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, is the federal law (administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or “CMS”) that, in partnership with the states, regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on human specimens. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”) gives the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the authority to regulate manufacturers of medical devices. We do not believe that our “dry lab” data analysis services require certification under CLIA, or that FDA jurisdiction or enforcement would be exercised over insurance underwriting or our use of data analysis for general health and wellness and non-diagnostic or medical treatment purposes (see section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Epigenetic Testing Services”).





7







Any adverse change in present laws or regulations, or their interpretation, federally or in one or more states in which we operate or plan to operate (or an aggregation of states in which we conduct a significant amount of business) could result in our curtailment or termination of operations in such jurisdictions, or cause us to not start or modify its operations in a way that adversely affects our ultimate profitability. Further, the failure of our wet-laboratory partners to hold a CLIA certification appropriate to the type of testing they provide could result in adverse regulatory action (see section titled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Epigenetic Testing Services”). Any such action could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, primarily through a material decrease in revenues, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.



Suppliers and Lab Processing



Our supplies and lab processing primarily includes vendors that provide our saliva kits, arrays, and process samples at laboratories. We utilize third-parties for these supplies and services. While we consider many of these third-parties single suppliers, we have qualified second sources for our saliva kits and lab processing. Our arrays are specialized, and we would not be able to quickly change suppliers should the need arise.



Supply interruptions, tariffs on components used on our saliva kits, arrays and others, or price increases may slow production, delay shipments to our customers or increase production costs in the future, any of which could adversely affect our financial results. Although we have not experienced any significant delays or interruptions, we expect that delays, interruptions or non-optimal scheduling of production related to interruptions in components we use to provide our services would result in an increase to our costs. We can give no assurance that global supply-chain constraints, geopolitical conflicts or limited ability for third-parties to be able to provide the materials and components we need will not adversely affect our ability to procure materials and components necessary to develop our products.



Employees 



As of March 20, 2023, we have five executive officers and approximately 24 other employees and consultants supporting our business. We have sought to bring together a diverse and multidisciplinary group of professionals who share in our passion for modernizing the life insurance industry with longevity science.
