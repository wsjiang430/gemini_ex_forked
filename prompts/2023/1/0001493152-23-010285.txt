Item 1. Business
Overview of Business
 
We are a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics targeting human aging and degenerative diseases. Our mission is to apply our comprehensive experience in fundamental biological processes of human aging to a broad range of age-associated medical conditions. We believe that demand for therapeutics addressing such conditions is on the rise, commensurate with the demographic shift of aging in the United States and many other industrialized countries.
 
Our proprietary technology, based on telomerase-mediated cellular immortality and regenerative biology, allows us to utilize telomerase-expressing regenerative pluripotent stem cell (“PSCs”) for the manufacture of cell-based therapies to regenerate tissues afflicted with age-related chronic degenerative disease. We own or have licenses to a number of patents and patent applications used in the generation of these product candidates, including intellectual property related to PSC-derived clonal embryonic progenitor cell lines (PureStem® technology) and HyStem® delivery matrices. Our technology platform also includes UniverCyte™ which uses the HLA-G gene to potentially confer low immune observability to cells, so as to suppress rejection of transplanted cells and tissues. AgeX plans to use or license the use of this patented technology to produce genetically-modified master cell banks of pluripotent stem cells that can then be differentiated into any young cell type of the human body that now express the immune tolerogenic molecule.
 
Our product candidates in the discovery stage include two cell-based therapies derived from telomerase-positive PSCs and two product candidates derived from our proprietary induced tissue regeneration (iTRTM) technology. We have also sponsored a research program to derive neural stem cells from PSCs to treat degenerative diseases such as Huntington’s Disease. We will need to conduct or sponsor research and development work, or license our technology to other biotechnology or pharma companies interested in furthering research and development, as part of our plan to develop these cell- and drug-based therapies, each targeting large unmet needs in age-related medicine.
 
Development of Our Business
 
AgeX was incorporated during 2017 as a subsidiary of Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lineage”), formerly known as BioTime, Inc. On August 17, 2017, we entered into an Asset Contribution and Separation Agreement (the “Asset Contribution Agreement”) with Lineage pursuant to which Lineage contributed certain assets and cash to us in exchange for 28,800,000 shares of our common stock.
 
The assets contributed to us by Lineage included laboratory equipment, patents, patent applications, and certain human pluripotent cell lines and human embryonic progenitor cell lines and shares of LifeMap Sciences, Inc. common stock representing a controlling interest in that company. Concurrently with the contribution of assets to us by Lineage under the Asset Contribution Agreement, we entered into a License Agreement with Lineage pursuant to which Lineage has licensed to us, with rights to sublicense, certain intellectual property, including patents and patent applications and know-how for use in the development, manufacture and commercialization of products or services for the prevention, treatment, amelioration, diagnosis or monitoring of all human and non-human animal diseases and conditions except for the field of medical products, devices and services for the reserved Lineage fields of orthopedic, ophthalmic, and medical aesthetic uses (the “Lineage Exclusive Field”). In addition, Lineage retains an option right, on terms to be negotiated, to license iTR patents in research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of treatments based on iTR in the Lineage Exclusive Field. The licensed patents and know-how relate generally to (a) PureStem® human embryonic progenitor cell lines, and (b) methods of manufacturing and quality control analysis of cell based therapies derived from pluripotent stem cells. We also received an option to license certain Lineage retained rights outside of orthopedic indications unless a license grant would compete with a Lineage program or products in the Lineage Exclusive Field.
 
Lineage and certain Lineage subsidiaries also entered into agreements pursuant to which they have licensed or sublicensed to us, on a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty bearing basis, certain additional patents and patent rights and know-how relating to HyStem® hydrogel technology, human embryonic progenitor cell technology, and human pluripotent stem cell lines and technology for use outside the Lineage Exclusive Fields, or in the case of certain sublicense rights, fields previously licensed to third parties.
 
The human embryonic progenitor cell lines, human pluripotent stem cell lines, and patents contributed or licensed or sublicensed to us by Lineage and its subsidiaries include our initial product candidates AGEX-BAT1 brown adipocytes and AGEX-VASC1 young vascular cells, and our foundation technologies PureStem®, HyStem® and induced tissue regeneration or iTRTM technology.

Concurrently with the acquisition of assets from Lineage, we sold 4,950,000 shares of common stock for $10.0 million in cash primarily to investors other than Lineage. At the close of the financing, Lineage owned 85.4% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. On June 7, 2018, we sold 2.0 million shares of common stock for $2.50 per share to Juvenescence for aggregate cash proceeds to us of $5.0 million.
 
On August 30, 2018, Lineage sold 14.4 million of its shares of AgeX common stock to Juvenescence. Upon completion of the transaction, Lineage’s ownership in AgeX was reduced from 80.4% to 40.2% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and Juvenescence’s ownership in AgeX was increased from 5.6% to 45.8% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, beginning on August 30, 2018, we were no longer considered a subsidiary of Lineage for financial reporting purposes, because on that date, Lineage experienced a “loss of control” of a subsidiary, as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).
 
On November 28, 2018 (the “Distribution Date”) Lineage distributed to its shareholders, on a pro rata basis, 12,697,028 shares of the AgeX common stock it then held (the “Distribution”). Immediately after the Distribution, Lineage retained 1,718,972 shares of AgeX common stock, representing approximately 4.8% of the common stock then issued and outstanding. Following the Distribution, our common stock began publicly trading on the NYSE American under the symbol “AGE.”
 
During August 2018, we expanded our technology platforms by acquiring from Escape Therapeutics, Inc. patents and patent applications related to HLA-G-modified cells and methods of generating allogeneic cells with reduced risk of being rejected by patients regardless of the HLA class I haplotype. These patents are the foundation for our UniverCyteTM technology platform.
 
During March 2021, AgeX disposed of its interest in LifeMap Sciences pursuant to the terms of the LifeMap Merger Agreement.
 
In connection with our sponsored Huntington’s Disease research program at the University of California at Irvine (“UCI”), we and certain researchers who contributed to the Huntington’s Disease research work formed a new subsidiary, of which we are presently the majority shareholder, to pursue clinical studies of the use of derived neural stem cell to treat that disease. The new subsidiary is still in the organizational stage and commencement of clinical study work will depend on its ability to obtain financing through grants or third-party investment.
 
During March 2023, we borrowed $10,000,000 from Juvenescence under the terms of a Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the “$10 Million Secured Note”) and used the loan proceeds to make a $10,000,000 loan to Serina, in order to provide financing to Serina in contemplation of corporate restructuring plans that include a potential merger between AgeX and Serina in which AgeX would be the surviving company. AgeX’s restructuring plans also include a potential spinoff of AgeX’s subsidiary Reverse Bio through a distribution of some or all of the shares of capital stock of Reverse Bio held by AgeX to AgeX stockholders following a financing of Reverse Bio through the sale of shares of Reverse Bio common stock to private investors (the “Reverse Bio Financing”). If the Reverse Bio spinoff is completed, Reverse Bio would become a separate publicly traded company.
 
Serina has developed a proprietary drug delivery polymer technology based upon the polymer poly (2-oxazoline), or POZ™, and is developing a pipeline of proprietary and partnered programs applying this platform to Parkinson’s disease, cannabinoids, cancer, and pain. Serina has recently applied POZ technology to developing a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) for use across multiple indications such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, and gene therapy and cancer immunotherapy. No definitive agreement regarding a merger between AgeX and Serina has been negotiated or executed nor has the merger been approved by the respective boards of directors of AgeX and Serina. Further, a merger cannot be consummated unless approved by the stockholders of AgeX and Serina. Accordingly, there is no assurance that AgeX and Serina will reach agreement on the terms of a merger or that, if such an agreement is reached, the stockholders of AgeX and Serina will approve the merger.
 
Definitive agreements regarding the Reverse Bio Financing and a Reverse Bio spinoff have not yet been executed, nor has AgeX’s board of directors approved the Reverse Bio spinoff. Accordingly, there is a risk that the Reverse Bio Financing and the Reverse Bio spinoff may never be consummated.

Emerging Growth Company
 
We are an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable, in general, to public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These provisions include:

● | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | no non-binding stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”); (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt securities during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. However, we have elected to comply with newly adopted or revised accounting standards when they become applicable to public companies because our financial statements were previously consolidated with those of our former parent company Lineage which is not an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act and is therefore not permitted to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that become applicable to public companies. This election under the JOBS Act to not delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.
 
Overview of Our Opportunity in Age-Related Diseases
 
To date, conventional pharmaceutical approaches to the chronic degenerative conditions associated with aging have provided limited benefit. Often the approaches offer merely relief from the symptoms of ageing and age-related disease, rather than targeting underlying disease processes. We believe this is about to change through harnessing the power of new cellular and molecular technologies. We aim to lead this coming revolution with our pioneering technologies to restore tissue and organ function. Our cell therapy approach is focused on generating and delivering new cells to patients. Our iTR approach is focused on reversing the age of cells already in the body, where our research team in February 2020 published that they had converted the cells of a 114-year-old to young pluripotent stem cells in the lab [J. Lee et al., Induced pluripotency and spontaneous reversal of cellular aging in supercentenarian donor cells, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communication, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.02.092].
 
Aging is one of the most significant demographic trends of our time. As shown in Figure 1, the U.S. Census Bureau projects a sharp rise in the number of Americans over 80 years of age, with an acceleration occurring between the years 2020 and 2030.

This demographic shift associated with 76 million aging baby boomers poses a significant challenge to our healthcare system and our economy as a whole. The unsolved problem relates to the fact that chronic conditions account for about 80% of total health care expenditures in the United States, with the elderly having a higher prevalence of chronic degenerative disease than the young. Approximately 80% of older adults have one chronic disease, and 68% have two or more.
 
Our technology platforms reflect over 25 years of research and development in cell immortality and regenerative medicine. It is designed to address some of the largest unmet needs of an aging population by translating state-of-the-art laboratory science relating to aging into meaningful therapeutic biologicals and drugs.
 
Overview of Our Product Candidates
 
Our product pipeline includes two cell-based and two iTR-based product candidates in development.
 
Our lead cell-based therapeutic candidates in development are AGEX-BAT1 and AGEX-VASC1:
 

● | AGEX-BAT1 is our lead cell therapy product candidate in the discovery stage of development utilizing PSC-derived brown adipocytes for the treatment of certain age-related metabolic disorders such as Type II (adult-onset) diabetes and obesity. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AGEX-VASC1 is a cell-based therapy in the discovery stage of development comprised of young regenerative vascular-forming cells. AGEX-VASC1 may restore vascular support in aged ischemic tissues such as in peripheral vascular disease and ischemic heart disease. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our lead small molecule drug-based therapeutic candidate for iTRTM in discovery is AGEX-iTR1547 and our lead biologic candidate for iTR is AGEX-iTR1550:
 

● | AGEX-iTR1547 is a drug-based formulation and AGEX-iTR1550 (also known as Renelon™) is a gene delivery technology, both of which are in the discovery stage of development. Initial indications for use may include scarless wound repair. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our research related to the reprogramming of aging has also led to novel insights into cancer. We have filed patent applications on inventions that relate to these discoveries. These technologies may provide novel targets for cancer therapy and diagnosis. One such cancer therapeutic in the early stages of development is designated “EPROTM” (embryonic promoter-regulated oncolysis). EPRO is an oncolytic gene therapy strategy that may provide a novel means of selectively destroying an array of different types of cancer cells. Successful development of EPRO will be dependent, in part, on the availability of financing and licensing or joint development opportunities.
 
Our currently marketed research products include cGMP ES Cells (human embryonic stem or “hES”) cells produced under current good manufacturing practices (or “cGMP”) and PSC-derived cells for research:
 

● | cGMP PSC lines and PSC-derived cells for research: Through our ESI BIO division, we market cGMP PSC lines as well as PSC-derived cells. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview of Our Technology Platforms
 
The technology underlying our product development programs is based on telomerase-mediated cellular immortality and regenerative biology. By “telomerase-mediated cellular immortality” we refer to the fact that cells that express sufficient levels of a protein called telomerase are capable of replicating without limit. By “regenerative biology,” we refer to novel methods to regenerate tissues afflicted with age-related chronic degenerative disease such as peripheral vascular disease and ischemic heart disease as well as age-related metabolic disorders such as those associated with Type II diabetes and obesity, as well as others. We utilize telomerase-expressing regenerative Pluripotent Stem Cells, or PSCs, for the manufacture of cell-based therapies. We own or have licensed numerous patents and patent applications covering methods and compositions relating to this technology platform.
 
Our core technology platforms provide us with a strong foundation for successfully addressing many of the diseases of ageing by focusing on broad therapeutic applicability and commercially scalable technologies:
 
1. PureStem®: AgeX’s allogeneic cell derivation and manufacturing platform, based on human embryonic progenitors, which are cells in state of development between embryonic stem cells and adult cells. We believe PureStem has the potential to solve several major challenges faced by the cell therapy industry by generating cellular therapeutics which would:
 

● | be commercialized as “off-the-shelf” products 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | be pure and industrially scalable 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have lower cost of goods per unit 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | be amenable to traditional pharma supply chain logistics 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have the potential for acceptable reimbursement prices, unlike the very expensive autologous products, and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have higher clinical adoption from expected cost savings and more simplified processes. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, we believe PureStem cells may have advantages over mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which may only survive transiently in the body and exert any short-term benefit by releasing paracrine factors, which may limit their potential of MSCx.
 
MSCs neither engraft nor become specialized cells. On the other hand, cells derived from PureStem progenitors will be young, not prone to the disadvantages associated with older cells, and are expected to become permanently engrafted in the body to deliver a true regenerative outcome. To date, AgeX has isolated more than 200 cell types from PureStem.
 
2. UniverCyte™: AgeX’s pioneering technology to genetically modify allogeneic donor cells to potentially become hypoimmunogenic/universal, so they can potentially be transplanted into all patients in an off-the- shelf manner, without the normal need for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and receipt or immunosuppression. UniverCyte utilizes a potent molecule called HLA-G. HLA is a group of related proteins that helps the immune system distinguish the body’s own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria. HLA-G’s only known physiological role in nature is to prevent destruction of a semi-allogeneic fetus by the maternal immune system. UniverCyte could potentially avoid immune rejection of transplanted cells, solving a major challenge facing the allogeneic cell therapy industry. In addition to utilizing UniverCyte™ for its own future cell therapy products, AgeX may make UniverCyte™ available to other cell therapy companies through licensing arrangements.
 
3. HyStem®: Delivery technology to stably engraft cells or slowly release small molecules in the body for greater safety and efficacy. The key advantages of HyStem® over competitors may include: (1) higher cell retention, survival, proliferation and engraftment; (2) biodegradability which can be fine-tuned; (3) non-immunogenicity; (4) immunosuppressive in nature; (5) ease of usage; and (6) scalability.
 
4. Induced Tissue Regeneration (iTRTM): The aim of iTR is to return aged cells back to a youthful state, thereby inducing a capacity for scarless regeneration characteristic of early developing tissues, without reverting cells to pluripotency. This technology is sometimes referred to as “partial reprogramming” or “epigenetic reprogramming of aging.” This novel approach may trigger complete regeneration of cells, and potentially even complex tissues, damaged as a result of age-related degenerative processes or trauma. The premise behind iTR is that aging, and in turn degenerative diseases of old age, are a result of the loss of two characteristics of cells; namely, replicative immortality and regenerative capacity. These two characteristics are present in embryonic cells but are lost at the embryonic to fetal transition (EFT). With this loss, humans can no longer generate new cells or repair damaged cells scarlessly and in sufficient numbers to maintain health. We discovered that cells begin expressing the gene COX7A1 at the EFT when regeneration is commonly lost. Therefore, the gene may be a key inhibitor of cellular regeneration. For example, we have discovered that restoring a regenerative pattern of COX7A1 gene expression may facilitate hair regeneration in mouse models. In addition, we have invented multiple platforms for delivering iTR using small molecules as well as biologic strategies such as those using gene therapy to transiently express reprogramming factors. We have filed patent applications on the use of iTR in a wide array of degenerative conditions including cancer.
 
5. ESI Cell Lines: AgeX has six clinical-grade human embryonic stem cell lines, they are distinguished as the first clinical-grade human pluripotent stem cell lines created under current Good Manufacturing Practice as described in Cell Stem Cell (2007;1:490-4). They are listed on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stem Cell Registry in the USA and are among the best characterized and documented stem cell lines in the world. ESI-053 is among only a few pluripotent stem cell lines from which a derived cell therapy product candidate has been granted FDA IND clearance for human studies. The FDA cleared an IND application from ImStem Biotechnology, one of our sublicensees, for a MSC product derived from ESI-053 for multiple sclerosis. This was believed to be the first MSC product derived from a pluripotent stem line to be accepted for a human trial by the FDA. The ESI cell lines are available as research or clinical grade product, and have been offered since 2006.
 
Business Strategy
 
Each of our four proprietary platform technologies, PureStem® for cell derivation and manufacturing, UniverCyte™ for generation of hypoimmunogenic cells, iTRTM for reversing the age of cells already in the body and HyStem® for cell or small molecule-based iTRTM delivery, presents AgeX with a multiplicity of attractive opportunities which we may pursue. Given these platform technologies may be highly desirable to multiple academic and biopharma companies due to their broad applicability and potentially important clinical and commercial benefits, AgeX plans to pursue different business models for these platforms:

● | Co-Development and Licensing: Our PureStem® and UniverCyte™ technologies as well as our ESI cell lines may have applications in the development of a broad range of cell therapy products. We will seek opportunities to license these AgeX technologies to other cell therapy or biopharma companies to bring in early revenue streams, especially for therapies that AgeX does not presently intend to develop. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cellular Therapy: AgeX presently does not have the laboratory and research staff required to conduct in-house research and development for its product candidates, including AGEX-BAT1 and AGEX-VASC1. Instead, AgeX may conduct research and development of those product candidates through a variety of alternative strategies, including but not limited to sponsoring research and development work at research laboratories at universities or other educational institutions, entering into co-development and marketing arrangements with researchers or other companies in the cell therapy or biopharma industry, and engaging contract service providers to conduct research and development and manufacturing for AgeX for particular product candidates. Our sponsored Huntington’s Disease research program at UCI has led to the organization of a new AgeX subsidiary, of which we are presently the majority shareholder, to pursue clinical studies of the use of derived neural stem cell to treat that disease. The new subsidiary is still in the organizational stage and commencement of clinical study work will depend on its ability to obtain financing through grants or third-party investment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reverse Bioengineering, Inc.: Partial cellular reprogramming using our iTRTM technology may one day allow us to revert aged or diseased cells inside the body back to a more youthful, healthy and functional state. We incorporated Reverse Bioengineering, Inc. (“Reverse Bio”) as an AgeX subsidiary to develop our revolutionary iTRTM platform. Reverse Bio will allow for a dedicated focus on iTRTM in terms of equity financing and advancing our iTRTM technology to proof-of-concept in an animal model. We have assigned to Reverse Bio our patent portfolio for iTR development, but the future operations of Reverse Bio will depend in large measure on its ability to raise its own capital. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of these models may provide particular benefits to AgeX in terms of financing and efficiency of operations. However, each alternative has potential disadvantages as well. If AgeX out-licenses its technology it will avoid the costs and risks of research and development, clinical trials, regulatory approval, manufacturing, and commercialization of product candidates, but the revenues AgeX would receive from commercialization of products developed under those arrangements would likely be limited to royalties on product sales and potentially licensing fees and milestone payments representing a relatively small portion of total product revenues. Similarly, co-development and marketing or similar arrangements would permit AgeX to share costs and risks but would also require AgeX to share revenues from the product candidates that may be successfully developed and commercialized. See “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Report for information about certain risks associated with reliance on arrangements with third parties for research, product development, clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercializing product candidates.
 
We plan to finance our iTRTM and AGEX-BAT1 research and development through Reverse Bio. To the extent that such financing is obtained through the sale of capital stock or other equity securities to investors or other biopharma companies by Reverse Bio, or the sale of Reverse Bio shares held by AgeX, our equity interest in Reverse Bio and our iTRTM and AGEX-BAT1 business would be diluted.
 
Background of Human Aging
 
Cell Immortality
 
There is a growing consensus in the scientific community that human aging is due in large part to the aging of individual cells in the various tissues of the body (somatic cells). In contrast, the reproductive lineage of cells (germ-line) perpetuate the human species from generation-to-generation without limit and continue to generate new people over the millennia.
 
In 1961, Dr. Leonard Hayflick first reported that normal human cells in the body (unlike the germ-line) can proliferate for only a finite number of times (typically fewer than 100 times). This phenomenon, known as the “Hayflick Limit”, “cell mortality”, or “cellular aging”, is a normal property of somatic cells. In the 1990s, our CEO, Dr. Michael D. West, founded a biotechnology company called Geron Corporation, where his team isolated for the first time the human gene called “Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase” or “telomerase.” In 1998, Geron scientists in collaboration with scientists at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, published the result that telomerase could stop the aging of human cells, or could “immortalize” them.
 

Figure 2. The Germ-line/soma dichotomy wherein germ-line cells express telomerase, maintain telomere length, and exhibit replicative immortality, while body (somatic) cells lack telomerase, showing progressive telomere shortening until they reach the Hayflick limit.
 
In 1994, Dr. West’s group demonstrated through an assay for measuring telomerase activity that nearly 90% of cancer cell types cultured in the laboratory or tumors surgically removed from patients abnormally express telomerase. This broke the then dogma that there was no common mechanism at work in cancer. Scientists have concluded that cell mortality, while being detrimental in old age, benefits us early in life by helping to repress cancer cell growth. Figure 2 illustrates this dichotomy wherein immortal cells such as the germ-line cells that perpetuate the species are immortal through telomerase activity while body (somatic) cells lack telomerase expression, and as a result show progressive telomere shortening and a finite lifespan (are mortal).

The Weismann Barrier
 
Early in the evolution of life, primitive unicellular and even multicellular organisms may have lacked programmed aging as a result of the potential of their cells having the potential for both replicative immortality and regeneration. However, in more complex animals such as mammals, somatic cells lose not only replicative immortality, but after most organ systems are formed during embryonic development, they also lose full regenerative potential. This repression of both -telomerase-mediated cell immortality and regeneration potential is called the “Weismann Barrier” (see Figure 3).
 

Figure 3. The Weismann Barrier coincides with the loss of both replicative immortality and regeneration. Levels of expression of the gene COX7A1 provide a useful marker of the loss of regenerative potential.

PSCs represent the earliest stages of human development and are the first normal human cells cultured in the laboratory that display both telomerase-mediated replicative immortality and regenerative potential. Therefore, our scientists utilized these cells as well as the primitive regenerative cells derived from them, called “PureStem®” cell lines, in research where they were compared to diverse adult cells on the mortal side of the Weismann barrier to uncover the mechanisms regulating the loss of regenerative potential. Artificial intelligence algorithms were used to parse millions of gene expression data points and the results were published in late 2017. Figure 3 shows the Weismann Barrier and the associated rise of a gene expression marker of the non-regenerative state designated COX7A1. This proprietary marker, along with other insights obtained from the research, provides us with a window into this biology and a means of screening for agents capable of restoring a regenerative state to old nonregenerative cells. It is anticipated that such agents may not only reset the pattern of gene expression in adult cells back to that their regenerative counterparts but may also induce tissue regeneration when applied in vivo in the context of age-related degenerative disease. Since the previously mentioned 2017 publication described the re-emergence of the regenerative phenotype in the majority of cancer cell lines, the discoveries may open the door to potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic implications as well.
 
Pluripotent Stem Cells (PSCs)
 

Figure 4. Pluripotent Stem Cells (PSCs) possess both telomerase-mediated replicative immortality and regenerative potential, capable of producing all human cell types.
 
In an effort to utilize telomerase-mediated immortality and regenerative biology in the development of novel therapeutics, in the mid-1990s, Dr. West, organized a collaboration with Drs. James Thomson, John Gearhart, and Roger Pedersen that led to the first isolation of PSCs. In contrast to other types of cells, PSCs are unique by at least two important criteria. The first criterion relates to the ability of pluripotent cells to proliferate, or make more copies of themselves, indefinitely, that is to say, they are “immortal.” The second relates to the ability of PSCs to differentiate into any of the hundreds of specialized cell types in the body. This replicative immortality of PSCs facilitates the industrial scalability of product. We believe that many of these cell types have potential for regenerating function in tissues damaged by degenerative diseases when transplanted. A small sampling of these cell types is shown in Figure 4. Unlike PSCs, adult stem cells typically have severely-reduced scale-up potential (are mortal unlike immortal PSCs), and have passed the Weismann Barrier, and are therefore limited in their ability to regenerate normal tissue when transplanted in vivo. Therefore, we believe that PSC-based cellular therapeutics have significant competitive advantages over cell-based therapeutics being developed by many adult stem cell companies.

Our Technology Platforms
 
PureStem® Technology
 
Regulatory approval of cell- and tissue-based products require high standards of quality control. In the case of stem cell-derived products, there is a high standard for ensuring the known identity, purity, and reproducibility of the cells to be administered. PSCs provide certain advantages over adult stem cell products when used in the manufacture of cell-based therapeutics for the treatment of age-related disease. These advantages include:

● | The replicative immortality of the PSCs which facilitates the indefinite scale-up of PSC master cell banks for the manufacture of uniform product, as well as an immortal substrate for targeted genetic modifications. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PureStem® technology is based on the observation that embryonic anlagen of many tissues in the human body are naturally comprised of highly proliferative cells with relatively long telomere length. Therefore, it is possible to generate clonal lineages of these cells in vitro. Cells derived from adult tissues commonly permanently cease to divide after a certain number of doublings, a condition known as senescence. In addition, adult and even fetal tissues largely contain differentiated cells often with limited or no capacity of replication in vitro. As a result, the clonal expansion of human embryonic progenitor cell types allows not only a novel and more facile point of scalability but also generates populations of cells that are multipotent instead of pluripotent, and therefore markedly easier to define identity, purity, and potency.
 
We have studied the fate of over 200 diverse PureStem cell lines in thousands of differentiation conditions. This was accomplished by thawing individual cryopreserved PureStem cell lines, culturing them in the laboratory, and then exposing the cells to factors that differentiate cells such as protein growth and differentiation factors, hormones, and small molecules implicated in causing cells to change from one type of cell into another (differentiation). Using individual cells from the over 200 diverse PureStem cell lines previously isolated and cryopreserved, we treated the diverse cells with thousands of differentiation conditions, prepared RNA, and determined the gene expression pattern of the cells using gene expression microarrays. These experiments have shown that the PureStem cell lines display site-specific markers that identify not only the type of cells, but also where in the body the cells would normally reside. Therefore, in the example of cartilage cells, it was possible to produce diverse types of cartilage in this manner. We have licensed from our former parent company Lineage Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lineage”) PureStem applications outside of orthopedics, medical aesthetics, and certain ophthalmological applications.
 
We have chosen two PureStem applications for our initial product development based on unmet medical need along with other factors. The first product candidates are AGEX-BAT1, brown adipose tissue or BAT cells for the treatment of metabolic disorders such as obesity or Type II diabetes, and AGEX-VASC1, vascular endothelial progenitors for the treatment of age-related ischemic disease such as that leading to peripheral vascular disease and ischemic heart disease. These cells will be formulated in a delivery matrix designated HyStem® to promote viability of the graft as well as to localize the cells to the intended site in the body.

HyStem® Delivery Technology
 
HyStem® is a patented biomaterial that mimics the extracellular matrix that is the structural network of macromolecules surrounding cells in the body. The extracellular matrix is essential for normal cellular function and survival of transplanted cells. Many tissue engineering and regenerative cell-based therapies are expected to benefit from the delivery of therapeutic cells in a matrix for precise localized delivery and survival. HyStem is a unique hydrogel that has been shown to support cellular attachment in vivo. Current research at medical institutions has shown that HyStem is compatible with a wide variety of cells and tissue types including those of the brain, bone, skin, cartilage, vascular system and heart. The technology underlying HyStem hydrogels was developed at the University of Utah and has been exclusively licensed to Lineage for human therapeutic applications and sublicensed to AgeX for certain fields. The HyStem technology is based on a unique thiol cross-linking chemistry to prepare hyaluronan-based matrices as hydrogels. Since the first published report in 2002, there have been numerous academic scientific publications supporting the biocompatibility of thiol cross-linked hyaluronan-based matrices and their applications as medical devices and in cell culture, tissue engineering, and animal models of cell-based therapies.
 

Figure 5. AgeX plans to utilize the HyStem® technology for the delivery of cell-based therapeutics.


Due to the unique cross-linking chemistry, HyStem matrices have the ability to be safely combined with living cells and subsequently injected or applied locally as a hydrogel which allows the gel to conform to the three-dimensional contour of a tissue. Building upon this platform, we initially plan to use HyStem for cell-based therapy.
 
The building blocks for HyStem hydrogels may vary with the application but typically include combinations of hyaluronan, gelatin, or heparin, each of which has been thiol-modified. Hydrogels are formed by cross-linking mixtures of these thiolated macromolecules with polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA). The rate of gelation and the hydrogel stiffness can be controlled by varying the amount of cross-linker. An important attribute of HyStem hydrogels is their large water content, over 98%. As a result, these hydrogels have a high permeability for oxygen, nutrients, and other water-soluble metabolites.

UniverCyte™
 
Our UniverCyte™ technology uses a proprietary, novel, modified form of HLA-G and is intended to permit donor cells to be transplanted into patients without donor-patient tissue matching and without administering immunosuppressant medication. Immunosuppressive drugs can reduce patient resistance to infectious diseases and cancers as well as cause organ and other toxicities. Reducing or eliminating the need for immunosuppressants after cell transplantation by use of hypoimmunogenic cells may make therapies universally available. We plan to use or license the use of this patented technology to produce genetically-modified master cell banks of pluripotent stem cells that can then be differentiated into any young cell type of the human body that now express the immune tolerogenic molecule.
 
Products and Product Candidates
 
Our Therapeutic Product Candidates
 
AGEX-BAT1 - Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) Progenitors
 
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is abundant early in life but lost precipitously with age. This tissue is believed to generate heat through expression of a gene called UCP1. In addition, the high levels of glucose and lipid uptake by the tissue is believed to balance metabolism in young people. In contrast, central obesity and Type II diabetes has been correlated with low levels of BAT.
 

Figure 6. Human tissue-derived BAT cells (left) stained red for the presence of UCP1 show a minority of cells being true BAT cells. PureStem-derived AGEX-BAT1 cells are uniformly UCP1 positive.


The demonstration in published literature in the public domain that the transplantation of BAT from young mice to obese diabetic mice resulted in weight loss and increased insulin sensitivity has led to a search for a source of industrially-scalable clinical grade BAT cells as well as an appropriate matrix for lipotransfer. There currently is no FDA-approved matrix for cell transplantation. However, Lineage has obtained a CE Mark for the marketing of HyStem (Renevia) for cell-assisted lipotransfer procedures in Europe. Therefore, we believe HyStem can be used for the delivery of BAT cells produced using PureStem® technology. As shown in Figure 6, the AGEX-BAT1 progenitors strongly express the BAT marker UCP1 when induced to differentiate and show a relatively high degree of purity compared to human tissue-derived BAT.
 
We entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement with Ohio State University using AGEX-BAT1 in mice to determine whether transplantation of AgeX-BAT1 cells may lead to improvements in diet-induced obesity, metabolic health including glucose metabolism, and cardiac function. For purposes of this proof of concept work, two different cell transplant matrices were tested, HyStem and a 3-D silk scaffold. We consider this work to be an early stage study and expect to conduct or sponsor additional research on the potential therapeutic benefits of AGEX-BAT1.

AGEX-VASC1 - Vascular Progenitors
 
PureStem® technology can also yield highly purified embryonic vascular components. As shown below, select clonal lines express markers such as VE-Cadherin (CDH5) and PECAM1, as well as VWF and other markers of venous, arterial, and lymphatic endothelium. Flow cytometry shows purity indistinguishable from 100%.
 
In addition to vascular endothelial cells, we have characterized vascular smooth muscle cell progenitors. This makes it possible for us to construct two of the key cellular components of arterial vessels, such as those compromised in coronary artery disease.
 

Figure 7. PureStem-derived vascular endothelial cell lines are capable of regenerating young vasculature (bottom left) and appear to have essentially 100% purity by FACs analysis.
 
HyStem hydrogels have been successfully used in cell transplantation research in animal models and in a CE marked product developed by Lineage for autologous adipose tissue preparations to restore and/or augment facial volume as a treatment of facial lipoatrophy after subcutaneous fat volume loss. AgeX’s near term goal is to optimize process development for planned animal preclinical testing of AgeX-VASC1 formulated in HyStem for delivery into ischemic heart tissue to regenerate collateral circulation.

AGEX-iTR1547 — Induced Tissue Regeneration (iTRTM)
 
Leveraging our assets in pluripotency and bioinformatics, we have performed research manipulating cellular immortality and regenerative biology in human cells. In 2010, our scientists while at Lineage demonstrated the reversal of the developmental aging of human cells using transcriptional reprogramming technology. In 2017, we published certain markers of the Weismann barrier, and the high prevalence of a reversion back before the Weismann barrier in diverse cancer cell types cultured in vitro.
 
We extended this research to determine whether reprogramming can be modified to only reverse the aging of cells back before the Weismann Barrier, not back to pluripotency. We have utilized for example the gene COX7A1 as a marker of cells that have lost regenerative potential (crossed the Weismann Barrier). As shown in Figure 8, our proprietary formulation AGEX-iTR1547 has demonstrated initial capability of reducing the expression of the marker gene COX7A1 back to before the Weismann Barrier without reverting the cells to pluripotency. When implemented in vivo, this partial reprogramming, or iTR, would be expected to induce tissue regeneration, and when combined with telomerase, could modulate both cellular immortality and regenerative biology for therapeutic effect. In addition to the small molecule product candidate designated iTR1547, we have invented biological interventions based, for example, on gene therapy. Our inventions relating to iTR biologics disclose both DNA and RNA-based strategies. Our gene delivery iTR product candidate is designated iTR1550. We are performing research to optimize AGEX-iTR1547 and in parallel a gene delivery formulation designated AGEX-iTR1550 in order to initiate preclinical studies of one or both of the agents on the scarless regeneration of the skin.
 

Figure 8. PSCs such as ES Cells and PureStem EP Cells display a regenerative capacity like cells that have not cross the Weismann Barrier. During pre- and post-natal development, skin cells become increasingly incapable of scarless regeneration as reflected in increasing COX7A1 expression. iPS cell reprograming reverts cells back to pluripotency, while AgeX-iTR1547 reverts cells back only to a point prior to the Weismann Barrier (regenerative state).

Status and Development Plan
 
The product candidates we have chosen are in the discovery stage of development. Prior to filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for the initiation of clinical trials of our initial product candidates, AGEX-BAT1, AGEX-VASC1, and AGEX-ITR1547/AGEX-iTR1550 a number of important research and development goals will need to be achieved, including discovery-level research for the qualification of reagents used in the manufacture of the product, completion of the standard operating procedures to be used (SOPs), complete the methods and documentation for characterization of the product; and producing and testing the genetic modifications in the master cell banks of the pluripotent stem cells under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) in order to produce product that will not illicit immune rejection following transplantation. In addition, we will be required to expand the numbers of the pluripotent stem cell master cell banks for future use; produce working cell banks from which the product will be manufactured for clinical trials; produce the relevant product under cGMP conditions; and expand the number of relevant cells and cryopreserve them under cGMP conditions. In addition, we will be required to design the pre-clinical studies including the study endpoints, perform biosafety testing and release the first clinical batch based on preliminary characterization results, and complete full product characterization. Biosafety testing will necessarily include pilot testing in animals such as (NOD/SCID) mice, dosing spiking studies at early and later endpoints, tumorgenicity and biodistribution studies to determine whether the cells form undesired tumors or migrate to inappropriate sites respectively in the animal. Lastly, we will need to define the clinical trial and regulatory strategy and hold various meetings with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as successfully submit an investigational new drug application or IND to the FDA and receive clearance to begin trials. Thereafter, we will need to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the product in human clinical trials in Phase I and II trials, and continued safety and efficacy for achieving the desired endpoint in Phase III trials, potentially then leading to product registration. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business Operations” for discussion of risks relating to product development and clinical trials. These include, but are not limited to, failure to successfully complete the aforementioned studies due to the failure of the product, processes, or skills of our employees, unforeseen delays in the development process, failure to raise requisite financing, or failure to receive permission from the FDA to advance product development. To the extent we license development of one or more product candidates to third parties or enter into collaboration arrangements for product development, our licensees or collaborators would need to undertake and achieve the foregoing goals.
 
Because our product candidates are still in the discovery stage, our choice of product candidates and development plans are subject to change based on a variety of factors. We may determine to abandon the development of one or more of our product candidates, or we may prioritize the development of one or more product candidates, or we may select or acquire and prioritize the development of new product candidates. Our choice and prioritization of product candidates for development will be influenced by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:
 

● | Results of our laboratory research and any animal and clinical trials that we or any licensees or collaborators may conduct; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to enter into licensing or collaborative arrangements with other biotechnology or biopharma companies or universities with their own laboratory facilities and research staffs to conduct research and development of one or more product candidates; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our analysis of third-party competitive and alternative technology that may lead us to conclude that our product candidates or technologies may be non-competitive or obsolete; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our analysis of market demand and market prices for the products we plan to develop could lead us to conclude that market conditions are not favorable for receiving an adequate return on our investment in product development and commercialization; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The amount of capital that we will have for our development programs and our projected costs for those programs; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The issuance of patents to third parties that might block our use of the same or similar technology to develop a product candidate; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The views of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies on the pre-clinical product characterization studies required to file an IND in order to initiate human clinical testing of a therapeutic product candidate or to attain marketing approval for that product candidate, or to obtain an investigational device exemption for clinical trials, or clearance for a 510(k) application to market a medical device.

Other Products and Product Candidates
 
Neural Stem Cells
 
During January 2020, we began a research collaboration under a Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of California at Irvine (“UCI”) using our PureStem® technology to derive neural stem cells, with the goal of developing cellular therapies to treat neurological disorders and diseases. The primary goal of the research will be to develop a robust method of deriving neural stem cells from PSCs in sufficient quantity and with sufficient purity and identity for use in cell based therapy. The initial focus will be on Huntington’s disease, while other potential targets may include Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and stroke. UCI has already accumulated safety and efficacy animal data that may support an IND submission to the FDA for the commencement of clinical trials to treat Huntington’s disease. This collaboration has led to the organization of a new AgeX subsidiary, NeuroAirmid Therapeutics, Inc. (“NeuroAirmid”), jointly owned with UCI and certain researchers to pursue clinical development and commercialization of cell therapies derived using licensed inventions arising from the research program, as well as certain patent pending technology for neural stem cell derivation, and certain technical data to support IND submissions. The new subsidiary is still in the organizational stage and commencement of clinical study work will depend on its ability to obtain financing through grants or third-party investment.
 
ESI BIO Research Products
 
We, through our ESI BIO research product division, market a number of products related to pluripotent stem cells including research-grade as well as cGMP-grade human PSC lines. We plan to contract with third parties where the third parties to allow them to utilize cGMP PSC lines in defined fields of application in exchange for certain compensation including the payment of royalties to us if they are successful in developing and commercializing a product.
 
Subsidiaries
 
AgeX has three subsidiaries, Reverse Bio, ReCyte Therapeutics, Inc. (“ReCyte”) and NeuroAirmid. These subsidiaries are early stage pre-clinical research and development companies.
 
AgeX will develop its revolutionary iTRTM platform and AGEX-BAT1 through Reverse Bio. Reverse Bio will allow for a dedicated focus on iTRTM in terms of equity financing and advancing the iTRTM technology to proof-of-concept in an animal model. AgeX’s patent portfolio for iTR and AGEX-BAT1 development have been assigned to Reverse Bio, but the future operations of Reverse Bio will depend in large measure on its ability to raise its own capital. ReCyte is involved in stem cell-derived endothelial and cardiovascular related progenitor cells for the treatment of vascular disorders and ischemic conditions. AgeX owns 100%, 94.8%, and 50% of the outstanding capital stock of Reverse Bio, ReCyte, and NeuroAirmid, respectively. We expect that our ownership interests in Reverse Bio and NeuroAirmid will be diluted if those subsidiaries are successful in obtaining financing from investors or product development collaborators. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Manufacturing
 
We presently do not have any manufacturing facilities and we will need to rely on third party contract manufacturers for the production of our cell lines and product candidates and to comply with quality manufacturing processes and controls.

--

Facilities
 
We presently occupy 101 square feet of leased office space in a building in an office and research park at 1101 Marina Village Parkway, Suite 201, Alameda, California. We do not have our own research laboratory facilities.
Commercialization Plan
 
With the exception of our research product sales which generate a trivial amount of revenues, we currently have no commercialized or marketed products such as FDA-approved drugs in our portfolio. As a result, we have not yet assembled an infrastructure for sales and marketing. At the point in time, if ever, that our product candidates approach clearance or approval, we plan to develop a commercial plan that may initially include strategic marketing partnerships.
Intellectual Property
 
Patents and Trade Secrets
 
We rely primarily on patents and contractual obligations with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, appropriate patent protection for important and strategic components of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and certain foreign countries. There are no assurances that any of our intellectual property rights will guarantee protection or market exclusivity for our products and product candidates. We also use license agreements both to access technologies developed by other companies and universities and to convey certain intellectual property rights to others. Our financial success will be dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain commercially valuable patent claims, to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others if we are unable to obtain enabling licenses.

General Risks Related to Obtaining and Enforcing Patent Protection
 
There is a risk that any patent applications that we file and any patents that we hold or later obtain could be challenged by third parties and be declared invalid or infringing on third-party claims. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed any amounts that we may accrue on our consolidated financial statements as a reserve for contingent liabilities. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services.

The enforcement of patent rights often requires litigation against third-party infringers, and such litigation can be costly to pursue. Even if we succeed in having new patents issued or in defending any challenge to issued patents, there is no assurance that our patents will be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection against our competitors.
 
In addition to relying on patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological advancement to maintain our competitive position. We have entered into intellectual property, invention, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, and it is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with our consultants. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and know-how, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets and know-how or obtain access to our trade secrets, know-how, or proprietary technology.

Sublicense of Certain Progenitor Patents
 
Lineage has granted to us a sublicense of certain patents licensed to Lineage that pertain to the derivation of human embryonic progenitor cell lines. The sublicense will permit us to use the sublicensed patents for the treatment, palliation, diagnosis, or prevention of any disease, disorder or health condition outside of the Lineage Exclusive Field. The sublicense expires the later of July 10, 2028 or the latest expiration date of a sublicensed patent, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the sublicense.
 
We will pay Lineage a royalty on “net sales,” as defined in the sublicense agreement, until the royalty payments to Lineage’s licensor by Lineage total $1.2 million and thereafter will pay to Lineage a low single digit royalty on its own net sales and a low double digit royalty on sublicensing consideration.
 
If we grant a sublicense to use the patents, we will pay Lineage a portion of any consideration received for a sublicense, including but not limited to, upfront payments and milestones, and non-cash exchanges or considerations, but not payments for developing a product, service or process. If we become obligated to pay royalties to one or more affiliates of Lineage for the use of patent rights related to this sublicense and as a result, the royalties payable to Lineage with respect to royalties under the sublicense plus the royalties payable to the affiliates would exceed a designated amount of net sales, the royalties due to Lineage may be reduced but not less than the designated amount. In addition, we will pay to Lineage a royalty on “net sales,” as defined in the sublicense agreement, by the sublicensee. If we become obligated to pay royalties to one or more affiliates of Lineage for the use of patent rights related to this sublicense and as a result, the royalties payable to Lineage with respect to sales by a sublicensee plus the royalties payable to the affiliates would exceed a designated amount of net sales, the royalty due on net sales by the sublicensee may be reduced but not less than the designated amount.
 
The sublicense agreement includes reciprocal cross-licenses between Lineage and us with respect to any new patents that may be issued based on the use of the sublicensed patents. Any such license to Lineage will be exclusive in the Lineage Exclusive Field and nonexclusive in all other licensed fields. Any such license from Lineage to us will be for use outside the Lineage Exclusive Field and for medical products or services involving tendon. Each license will be for a term of 10 years.
 
The foregoing description of the sublicense agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the sublicense agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to our Registration Statement on Form 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
ESI License
 
Lineage’s subsidiary ES Cell International Pte (“ESI”) has granted to us non-exclusive rights to certain ESI patents and human pluripotent stem cell lines, or ESI Cell Lines, for use outside of the ESI Exclusive Field of orthopedic, ophthalmic, medical aesthetic, and spinal cord injury uses, and outside certain other fields for which ESI has previously granted licenses. We will pay ESI a 2% royalty on “net sales,” as defined in the license agreement. If we become obligated to pay royalties to one or more third party or to Lineage for the use of patent rights related to this license and as a result the royalties payable to ESI with respect to this license agreement plus the royalties payable to such third party or Lineage would exceed a designated amount of net sales, the royalty due on net sales by the sublicensee may be reduced. The patent license expires upon the latest expiration date of a licensed patent, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the license. All other rights under the license are terminable by either party under the conditions specified in the license.
 
If we grant rights to any third party to use ESI Cell Lines derived under cGMP, we will pay ESI a share of all consideration that we receive as consideration for the grant of those rights, including all cash and non-cash consideration but not royalties. We are not permitted to grant sublicenses to the licensed ESI patents but may sublicense the use of ESI Cell Lines.
 
AgeX also will pay ESI 5% of any fees that AgeX may receive for providing third parties with a “drug master file” for submission to the FDA or similar regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions that may be used to provide confidential detailed information about facilities, processes or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging and storing of one or more human drugs, including but not limited to biologics, cell lines and cell products.
 
The foregoing description of the ESI License Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the ESI License Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to our Registration Statement on Form 10 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition
 
The biotechnology industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid change (even disruptive advances) that challenge the ability of any one company to maintain leadership. Therefore, we face competition on multiple fronts, including from other biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and government research entities. We believe the competitive advantages of our technology platform and resulting product candidates arise from the large market opportunities addressed by our product candidates, their anticipated safety profile, the expected cost of manufacture of off-the-shelf products, our intellectual property, as well the fundamental and widespread role of cell aging and regeneration in human age-related degenerative disease.
 
There are numerous biotechnology companies developing therapeutics for human aging, with each company often focusing on a specific molecular pathway within cells. For example, ResTORbio, Inc. is developing modulators of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (“mTOR”) pathway to treat immunological and cardiovascular disorders. Calico Life Sciences LLC is a Google-founded research and development company aimed at identifying molecular pathways that control animal lifespan and translating these insights into novel therapeutics designed to increase human healthspan. Calico has not disclosed its lead product development plans. Unity Biotechnology, Inc. focuses on cellular senescence, in particular, the use of agents that can target senescent cells for selective ablation (senolysis). Unity’s stated targeted age-related diseases include osteoarthritis as well as other ophthalmological and pulmonary diseases. In addition, Altos Labs, Inc. (“Altos”) has reportedly received funding commitments in excess of $3 billion for research and development of products relating to age-reprogramming. The initial technology focus disclosed by Altos may compete with the iTR program within AgeX and its subsidiary Reverse Bio.
 
Our therapeutic product candidates in development are likely to face competition from a large number of companies and technological strategies including therapeutics intended to address our lead indications, including:
 

● | Type II diabetes: current standard of care treatments (though not necessarily focused on the root cause of the disease) include dieting and exercise programs to reduce weight, or pharmacological interventions with a wide array of medications, including: Metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza, or others); (DiaBeta, Glynase), glipizide (Glucotrol) and glimepiride (Amaryl); Meglitinides (repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglinide (Starlix)); Thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos)); DPP-4 (sitagliptin (Januvia), saxagliptin (Onglyza) and linagliptin (Tradjenta)); GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide (Byetta) and liraglutide (Victoza)); SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin (Invokana) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga)); and insulin therapy (Insulin glulisine (Apidra), Insulin lispro (Humalog), Insulin asgpart (Novolog), Insulin glargine (Lantus), Insulin detemir (Levemir), Insulin isophane (Humulin N, Novolin N)).

Many of our competitors have greater financial, collaborative, technical, regulatory, and human resources as well as products more advanced in development than our product pipeline, including products already marketed for our target indications. As a result, these competitors may have great success in obtaining regulatory approvals, reimbursement, or market acceptance. Our competitors, may have greater success in attracting qualified personnel, recruiting clinical trial sites, or in establishing strategic partnerships with larger pharmaceutical companies to fund large late-stage clinical trials or product marketing. In addition, our future business could be limited should our competitors commercialize products demonstrated to be more effective, safer, or less expensive than our comparable products.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
 
Government authorities at the federal, state, and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality, approval, safety, efficacy, distribution, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, marketing, import/export, and promotion of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Authorities also heavily regulate many of these activities for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (“HCT/Ps”).

FDA and Foreign Regulation of Therapeutic Products
 
The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities will regulate our proposed products as drugs, biologicals, or medical devices, depending upon such factors as: the use to which the product will be put, the chemical composition of the product, and the interaction of the product with the human body. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologicals under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), the Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), and implementing regulations. In addition, establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products are subject to additional registration and listing requirements, including current good tissue practice regulations. To the extent AgeX develops cellular and tissue-based products or therapies, its products will be subject to review by the FDA staff in its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) Office of Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies. In some instances, AgeX’s clinical study protocol for a cell therapy product must be reviewed by the National Institute of Health through its Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.
 
Any human drug and biological products that we may develop for testing, marketing, or use in the United States will be subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate, an investigational new drug (“IND”) submission must be made to the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at a hospital or medical center to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. Each clinical study is conducted under the auspices of an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”). The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.
 
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three “phases.” Phase I clinical trials are conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers or volunteers with the target disease or condition to assess safety. Phase II clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial. Phase III trials are large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials and are conducted with patients afflicted with the target disease or condition in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the intended patient population. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development initially required to create the product.
 
No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the U.S. until an appropriate New Drug Application (“NDA”) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) has been approved by the FDA. Submission of the application is no guarantee that the FDA will find it complete and accept it for filing. If an application is accepted for filing, following the FDA’s review, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to FDA approval. To date, the FDA has not granted marketing approval to any pluripotent stem-based therapeutic products and it is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject our product candidates to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologicals derived from other technologies.
 
The FDA offers several programs to expedite development of products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. A product may be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. In 2017, FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”) designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. An RMAT is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions that is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence such as electronic health records; through the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or through post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.
 
Some of our future products may be eligible for RMAT designation. There is no assurance that the FDA will grant breakthrough therapy, accelerated approval or RMAT status to any of our product candidates.

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug candidate, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we can commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
Combination Products
 
If we develop any products that are used with medical devices, they may be considered combination products, which are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts such as a biologic and a device. For example, we may use HyStem® hydrogels to administer one or more pluripotent stem cell-based therapy products. When regulated independently, biologics and devices each have their own regulatory requirements. However, regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device can be more complex, because in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply.
510(k) Medical Devices & Notification
 
Product marketing in the U.S. for most Class II and limited Class I devices typically follows a 510(k) pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as the predicate device. A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of PMA applications, or a product classification created by FDA when it granted de novo authorization. The manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and it either has the same technological characteristics, or it is shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device.
 
There are three types of 510(k)s: traditional; special, for devices that are modified and the modification needs a new 510(k) but the modification does not affect the intended use or alter the fundamental scientific technology of the device; and abbreviated, for devices that conform to a recognized standard. The special and abbreviated 510(k)s are intended to streamline review. The FDA intends to process special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt and abbreviated 510(k)s within 90 days of receipt. Though statutorily required to clear a traditional 510(k) within 90 days of receipt, the clearance pathway for traditional 510(k)s can take substantially longer.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
 
Post-Approval Matters
 
Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. Data resulting from these clinical trials may result in expansions or restrictions to the labeled indications for which a product has already been approved.
 
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing
 
The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, human tissue and cell products, and medical devices, requiring that they be produced in compliance with cGMP. The FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories, and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA, a material change is made to manufacturing equipment or to the location or manufacturing process, additional regulatory review may be required. The FDA also conducts regular, periodic visits to re-inspect the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes of manufacturers following an initial approval. If, as a result of those inspections, the FDA determines that that equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the manufacturer, including suspension of manufacturing operations. Issues pertaining to manufacturing equipment, facilities or processes may also delay the approval of new products undergoing FDA review.
 
Federal Funding of Research
 
The National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) has adopted guidelines on the use of hES cells in federally funded research, consistent with President Obama’s Executive Order which rescinded President Bush’s Executive Orders that permitted federal funding of research on hES cells using only the limited number of hES cell lines. The central focus of the guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research are derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, are no longer needed for this purpose, and are voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. Those hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.

27
--

California State Regulations
 
The state of California has adopted legislation and regulations that require institutions that conduct stem cell research to notify, and in certain cases obtain approval from, a Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (“SCRO Committee”) before conducting the research. Under certain California regulations, all hES cell lines that will be used in our research must be acceptably derived. California regulations further require certain records to be maintained with respect to stem cell research and the materials used. AgeX programs that involve the use of stem cells will be reviewed by a SCRO Committee to confirm compliance with federal and state guidelines. The hES cell lines that we use are all on the NIH registry of lines that have been reviewed and meet standards for federal funding grants.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 
Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by health care providers. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes, and formats used in health care transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.
 
The requirements under these regulations may periodically change and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially more costly than under current requirements. New laws governing privacy may also be adopted in the future. We can provide no assurance that we will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.
 
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate, in order to commit a violation. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying products (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim.
 
Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. There have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs.
 
In particular, the ACA has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on the healthcare industry. The ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective.
 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future, including efforts to implement changes to the law that may impact reimbursement for drugs and biologics.
 

28
--

 

Further, there has been heightened government scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed pharmaceutical products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Such proposals have included, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B and to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid. The Department of Health and Human Services has already started the process of soliciting feedback on some of these measures and, at the same, is immediately implementing others under its existing authority. Although some of these and other proposals will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the President are likely to continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
 
Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (the “DSCSA”) imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. While some requirements of the DSCSA began in November 2014, many key requirements, development of standards, and the system for product tracing will continue to be phased in until 2023. Among the requirements of the DSCSA, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers’ products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or that are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
 
Reimbursement
 
Medicare, Medicaid, and Third-Party Reimbursement Programs
 
Sales of the therapeutic products and medical devices that we and our subsidiaries may develop will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of those products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations.
 
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. In the United States, the federal and many state governments have adopted or proposed initiatives relating to Medicaid and other health programs that may limit reimbursement or increase rebates that providers are required to pay to the state. In addition to government regulation, managed care organizations in the United States, which include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations, hospital and physician alliances and pharmacy benefit managers, continue to put pressure on the price and usage of healthcare products. Managed care organizations and third-party payers seek to contain healthcare expenditures, and their purchasing strength has been increasing due to their consolidation into fewer, larger organizations and a growing number of enrolled patients. Adoption of price controls, cost-containment measures, and more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. If third-party payors do not consider the products we develop to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
 
Efforts by government agencies and state legislatures in the United States could affect us and our industry. The ACA increased many of the mandatory discounts and rebates and imposed a new Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers fee payable by manufacturers. The new U.S. presidential administration has identified repealing and replacing the ACA as a priority. The timing and method of the full or partial repeal or amendment of the ACA or the adoption of new healthcare legislation remains uncertain, but impending changes will likely impact the number of patient lives covered, the quality of the insurance, Medicaid eligibility and the level of patient protections provided.
 

29
--

 

Other legislative and regulatory actions that would have a significant impact include: changes to how the Medicare program covers and reimburses current and future drugs, changes in the Federal payment rate or new rebate requirements for covered drugs and policies for payment in Medicare or Medicaid; and changes to coverage and payment for biosimilars, including the current Medicare biosimilar coverage and payment policies intended to encourage biosimilar adoption, or other policies that provide easier substitution or reimbursement advantages.
 
We face similar issues outside of the United States. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for aa medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of placing a medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 5 persons on a full-time basis and 4 persons on a part-time basis. Two full-time and one part-time employees hold Ph.D.’s in one or more fields of science.
