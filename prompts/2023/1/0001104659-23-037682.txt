Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an early stage blank check company recently incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this annual report as our initial business combination.
Our sponsor, DHP SPAC-II Sponsor LLC, is an entity affiliated with David T. Hamamoto. Mr. Hamamoto currently serves as a director of Lordstown and previously served as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of DiamondPeak, which was a blank check company at the time of its 2019 initial public offering. On October 23, 2020, DiamondPeak completed its initial business combination with Lordstown Motors Corp. (“Lordstown”), a manufacturer of light duty electric trucks. As of March 28, 2022, other members of our sponsor include a fund managed by Antara Capital, which holds approximately 50% of the limited liability company interests of our sponsor and our other officers and directors. Antara Capital, founded by Himanshu Gulati in 2018, invests across a wide variety of financial instruments, including loans, bonds, convertible bonds, stressed/distressed credit and special situation equity investments.
Our management team is led by David Hamamoto, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and Michael Bayles, our Co-Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hamamoto is the founder of Diamond Head Partners, LLC, which he established in 2017 and currently serves as a director of Lordstown. Mr. Hamamoto has significant experience across the private and public markets as the former head of the NorthStar companies, which he founded as a private company in 1997, took public in 2004 with an approximately $300 million equity market capitalization, and sold to Colony Capital in 2017 at a $6 billion equity market capitalization. Prior to NorthStar, Mr. Hamamoto spent 14 years at Goldman Sachs, where he founded the Real Estate Principal Investments Area, raised the first Whitehall real estate private equity fund, and raised four additional Whitehall funds and one emerging market fund. We believe Mr. Hamamoto’s private real estate investing background and public market track record will benefit us in identifying and executing a business combination, such as the GSH Business Combination. Mr. Bayles, one of our directors and our Co-Chief Executive Officer, currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and a director of EVO Transportation & Energy Services, Inc. Mr. Bayles previously served as a director and chief restructuring officer from October 2020 to March 2021 and restructuring advisor from May 2020 to October 2020. Mr. Bayles served as a vice president of investments of Slam Corp., a special purpose acquisition company, from March 2021 through September 2022. Mr. Bayles previously served as an analyst at Antara Capital LP from May 2018 until May 2020, and as a credit analyst at GLG Partners from May 2016 to December 2017. Prior to GLG Partners, Mr. Bayles was a vice president at Avenue Capital Group from September 2008 to April 2016. Mr. Bayles started his career as an investment banking analyst at J.P. Morgan and then a restructuring analyst at Lazard. Mr. Bayles has a bachelor’s degree in economics from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Our board of directors also includes Jonathan A. Langer, who currently serves as Managing Member of Fireside Investments, LLC, a private investment firm that Mr. Langer founded in 2012, Judith A. Hannaway, a financial industry consultant and former Managing Director of Scudder Investments responsible for Special Product Development including closed-end funds, offshore funds and REIT funds, and Charles Schoenherr, who currently serves as Managing Director of Waypoint Residential, LLC, which invests in multifamily properties in the Sunbelt.
Proposed GSH Business Combination
On September 10, 2022, we entered into the GSH Business Combination Agreement with Hestia Merger Sub, Inc., a South Carolina corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary, and GSH, a South Carolina corporation. Pursuant to the terms of the GSH Business Combination Agreement, a business combination between the Company will be effected through the merger of Hestia Merger Sub, Inc. with and into GSH, with GSH surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of DHHC. Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the GSH Business Combination Agreement, the Company expects to be renamed United Homes Group, Inc. Capitalized terms not defined but otherwise used in the following description have the meanings ascribed to them in the GSH Business Combination Agreement.
Consideration
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the GSH Business Combination Agreement, at the Effective Time:

i. | Each GSH Class A share and each GSH Class B share issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the effective time of the GSH Business Combination (excluding shares owned by GSH as treasury stock or dissenting shares) will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively, equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in the GSH Business Combination Agreement).
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | Each GSH option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled in exchange for an option to purchase a number of shares of our Class A common stock as set forth on the consideration schedule (as defined in the GSH Business Combination Agreement) at an exercise price as set forth on such consideration schedule.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | Each GSH warrant outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the effective time of the GSH Business Combination shall automatically be converted into a warrant to acquire a number of shares of our Class A common stock in an amount and at an exercise price and subject to such terms and conditions, in each case, as set forth on the consideration schedule. Subject to certain exceptions, such terms and conditions will be the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the GSH warrant immediately prior to the effective time of the GSH Business Combination.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pursuant to the terms of the GSH Business Combination Agreement, we are required to cause the Class A common stock to be issued in connection with the GSH Business Combination to be listed on Nasdaq prior to the closing of the GSH Business Combination.
Earn Out Consideration
The holders of GSH shares, GSH options and GSH warrants, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time of the GSH Business Combination, will also have the contingent right to receive up to an aggregate of 20,000,000 Earn Out Shares. Each such holder will be entitled to receive Earn Out Shares in accordance with their Earn Out Pro Rata Share in three tranches upon the occurrence of the following milestones during the period commencing on the 90th day following the closing date and ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date: (i) a one-time issuance of 7,500,000 Earn Out Shares on the first date on which the volume weighted average price of our common stock over any 20 trading days within the preceding 30 consecutive trading day period (as adjusted, the “VWAP price”) is greater than or equal to $12.50; (ii) a one-time issuance of 7,500,000 Earn Out Shares on the first date on which the VWAP price is greater than or equal to $15.00; and (iii) a one-time issuance of 5,000,000 Earn Out Shares on the first date on which the VWAP price is greater than or equal to $17.50 (the “Earn-Out Milestones”).
Our sponsor has agreed not to transfer approximately 2.1 million Sponsor Earnout Shares until such shares are released by us upon the achievement of the Earn Out Milestones pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement. Our sponsor has also agreed that in the event that Closing DHHC Cash is less than $100,000,000, up to 1.0 million sponsor shares will be Sponsor Earnout Shares, subject to release upon the achievement of the Earn Out Milestones. See “Sponsor Support Agreement” below for more information regarding the Sponsor Earnout Shares and Earn Out Milestones.

The GSH Business Combination Agreement required GSH to immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with any person conducted prior to the execution and delivery of the GSH Business Combination Agreement with respect to, or which is reasonably likely to give rise to or result in, an Acquisition Proposal of GSH.
Conditions to Closing
Conditions to Each Party’s Obligations
The obligations of DHHC, Hestia Merger Sub, Inc. and GSH to consummate the GSH Business Combination are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the absence of any governmental order or law restraining, prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the GSH Business Combination, (ii) the approval of our stockholders of the Transaction Proposals, (iii) the approval of GSH’s stockholders of the GSH Business Combination Agreement and the GSH Business Combination, (iv) the effectiveness of the GSH Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and (v) DHHC having at least $5,000,001 of net tangible assets as of immediately after the Effective Time.
 Our obligation to consummate the GSH Business Combination is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the representations and warranties of GSH being true and correct to the standards applicable to such representations and warranties, (ii) each of the covenants of GSH having been performed or complied with in all material respects, (iii) the Lender Consents or Alternative Financing being obtained, (iv) each of the written consents as required under certain scheduled contracts being obtained, (v) the Pennington De-Consolidation being completed in compliance with the terms of the GSH 

7



Business Combination Agreement, and certain agreements relating thereto being executed, (vi) the Pre-Closing Recapitalization being completed in compliance with the terms of the GSH Business Combination Agreement, (vii) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect and (viii) the delivery of customary closing certificates and transaction documents.
The obligation of GSH to consummate the GSH Business Combination is also subject to the satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (i) the representations and warranties of us and Hestia Merger Sub, Inc. being true and correct to the standards applicable to such representations and warranties, (ii) each of our covenants having been performed or complied with in all material respects, (iii) Closing DHHC Cash being equal to or exceeding $125,000,000 (the “Minimum Cash Condition”), (iv) the approval by Nasdaq of the listing of our Class A common stock to be issued in connection with the GSH Business Combination, (v) the adoption of the DHHC A&R Certificate of Incorporation and DHHC A&R Bylaws, (vi) the Lender Consents or Alternative Financing being obtained, (vii) the DHHC Incentive Equity Plan being approved by the Company board and stockholders, (viii) the absence of a DHHC Material Adverse Effect, (ix) the composition of our board post-GSH Business Combination and (x) the delivery of customary closing certificates and transaction documents.
If any of the conditions to a party’s obligation to consummate the GSH Business Combination is not satisfied or waived in writing by such party, then such party will not be required to consummate the GSH Business Combination. There can be no assurance that the Minimum Cash Condition will be satisfied on the closing date. In the event that the public shareholders exercise their redemption rights with respect to a number of our common stock such that the Minimum Cash Condition would not be met based on cash held in the trust account, we would need to seek to arrange for additional third-party financing to be able to satisfy the Minimum Cash Condition. We plan to pursue third-party financing to satisfy the Minimum Cash Condition; however, there can be no assurance that any third-party financing will be entered into in connection with the GSH Business Combination and there can be no assurance that the Minimum Cash Condition will be satisfied. If the Minimum Cash Condition is not satisfied, amended or waived by GSH pursuant to the terms of the GSH Business Combination Agreement, then the GSH Business Combination would not be consummated.
Waivers
If permitted under applicable law, either DHHC or GSH may waive in writing any conditions for the benefit of itself contained in the GSH Business Combination Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to the GSH Business Combination Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, we cannot consummate the proposed transaction if we have less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”)), remaining after the Closing or fail to meet any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement contained in the GSH Business Combination Agreement after the Closing.
Termination
The GSH Business Combination Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances prior to the closing, including, but not limited to:

i. | by mutual written consent of us and GSH;
---+-----------------------------------------


ii. | by us, if GSH breaches its representations, warranties and covenants in the GSH Business Combination Agreement such that the closing conditions would not be satisfied (subject to a cure period);
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | by GSH, if we breach our representations, warranties and covenants in the GSH Business Combination Agreement such that the closing conditions would not be satisfied (subject to a cure period);
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iv. | subject to certain limited exceptions, by either us or GSH if the GSH Business Combination is not consummated by April 28, 2023;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


v. | by either us or GSH, if the requisite approval by our stockholders of the Required Transaction Proposals is not obtained after the conclusion of a meeting of our stockholders held for the purpose of voting on such proposals, and at which such stockholders duly voted on such Required Transaction Proposals;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


vi. | by either us or GSH, if a governmental order permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the GSH Business Combination is issued and becomes final and non-appealable; and
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8




vii. | by us, if GSH does not deliver the Company Stockholder Written Consent within 2 Business Days following the date of the GSH Business Combination Agreement.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the GSH Business Combination Agreement is validly terminated, none of the parties to the GSH Business Combination Agreement will have any liability or any further obligation under the GSH Business Combination Agreement other than customary confidentiality obligations, except in the case of Willful Breach or Fraud. 
Related Agreements
Sponsor Support Agreement
In connection with the execution of the GSH Business Combination Agreement, our sponsor entered into the Sponsor Support Agreement with us and GSH, pursuant to which our sponsor agreed to, among other things, (i) vote at any meeting of our stockholders all of its Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Sponsor Shares”) and any securities acquired after the execution of the Sponsor Support Agreement, in favor of each GSH Business Combination proposal, (ii) be bound by certain other covenants and agreements related to the GSH Business Combination and (iii) be bound by certain transfer and redemption restrictions with respect to such Sponsor Shares, in each case, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sponsor Support Agreement.
The sponsor has also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, not to transfer approximately 2.1 million Sponsor Earnout Shares (as defined in the Sponsor Support Agreement) until such shares are released under the Sponsor Support Agreement. Pursuant to the Sponsor Support Agreement, 37.5%, 37.5% and 25% of such Sponsor Earnout Shares will be released by us, respectively, upon the achievement of the Earn-Out Milestones, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Sponsor Support Agreement. Any such Sponsor Earnout Shares not vested prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing will be deemed to be forfeited.
The sponsor has also agreed that in the event that Closing DHHC Cash is less than $100,000,000, up to 1.0 million Sponsor Shares will convert to Sponsor Earnout Shares, subject to the same release conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph. In addition, members of the sponsor have made a commitment to purchase and not redeem an aggregate of 2.5 million public shares.
The sponsor has also agreed, pursuant to the terms of the Sponsor Support Agreement, to forfeit approximately 1.8 million sponsor shares and approximately 50% of its warrants that were acquired in a privately placement consummated simultaneously with the closing of our initial public offering. 
Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
The GSH Business Combination Agreement contemplates that, upon completion of the GSH Business Combination, the Company (which expects to be named United Homes Group, Inc. at that time), the sponsor, certain securityholders of the Company and certain former stockholders of GSH will enter into an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “A&R Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the A&R Registration Rights Agreement, among other things, UHG agrees to file a shelf registration statement with respect to the registrable securities under the A&R Registration Rights Agreement within 45 days of the Closing. Up to two times in any 12-month period, certain legacy company securityholders and legacy GSH stockholders may request to sell all or any portion of their registrable securities in an underwritten offering that is registered pursuant to the shelf registration statement, so long as the total offering price is reasonably expected to exceed $10,000,000. The combined company will also provide customary “demand” and “piggyback” registration rights. The A&R Registration Rights Agreement will provide that UHG will pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify the securityholders against certain liabilities.
Further, each securityholder party to the A&R Registration Rights Agreements agrees not to transfer any of their registerable securities subject to lock-up transfer restrictions (as described in the A&R Registration Rights Agreement) until the end of the applicable Lock-Up Period subject to certain customary exceptions described therein.
Financing Commitment Letter
In connection with the execution of the GSH Business Combination Agreement, we entered into a Financing Commitment Letter with the sponsor, David T. Hamamoto, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and an affiliate of our sponsor, and Antara Capital, an affiliate of our Sponsor, pursuant to which David T. Hamamoto and Antara Capital (collectively, the “Investors”) committed to, or to cause their respective affiliates to, purchase and not redeem at least in the aggregate 2.5 million shares of our Class A common stock. 

9



Specifically, David T. Hamamoto and Antara Capital have agreed, among other things, severally, and not jointly, subject to certain terms and conditions, (i) to purchase (in open market transactions or otherwise), or to cause one or more of its controlled affiliates to purchase, and beneficially own no less than 1,250,000 shares of our Class A common stock, no later than the date that is 5 business days prior to the special meeting to vote on the GSH Business Combination Agreement and (ii) following such purchases, not to sell, contract to sell, redeem or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, the acquired shares or the economic ownership of the acquired shares at any time prior to the consummation of the GSH Business Combination. The Investors have purchased and have not redeemed the shares required under the financing commitment letter. The acquired shares will not be subject to any restrictions on transfer or disposition.
Subscription Agreements
On March 23, 2023, in connection with the Company’s efforts to raise funds to meet the Minimum Cash Condition, the Company entered into certain private placement transactions (collectively, the “Share Lock-Up Agreements”) with certain investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class A common stock on the open market prior to March 16, 2023 (each a “Lock-Up Investor”), pursuant to which, and subject to and conditioned upon the satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in the Share Lock-Up Agreements, the Company agreed to issue to each Lock-Up Investor 0.25 UHG Class A Common Shares for a purchase price of $0.01, for each share of the Company’s Class A common stock held by such Lock-Up Investor at the Closing.
Also, on March 23, 2023, the Company and certain investors (“PIPE Investors”) entered into subscription agreements (collectively, the “PIPE Subscription Agreements”) providing for the purchase by the PIPE Investors at the effective time of the GSH Business Combination of (i) an aggregate of 471,500 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at a price per share of $10.00, and (ii) for each share of the Company’s Class A common stock purchased by each PIPE Investor, the Company agreed to issue to the applicable PIPE Investor 0.25 UHG Class A Shares for a purchase price of $0.01 per share for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $4.7 million.
PIPE Financing
As previously announced on March 22, 2023, the Company entered into a Convertible Note Purchase Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) among itself, GSH and a certain group of investors party thereto (the “PIPE Investors”). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Investors have agreed to purchase $80,000,000 in original principal amount of convertible promissory notes (the “Notes”) and 744,588 shares of Class A common stock in a private placement PIPE investment (the “PIPE Investment”) in connection with the GSH Business Combination. The aggregate gross amount of the PIPE Investment is approximately $75,000,000. The proceeds of the PIPE Investment are expected to be used by the Company to offset redemptions of the Company’s Class A common stock (see “Extension and Redemptions” below for details on redemptions of the Company’s Class A common stock), and may be used by DHHC to satisfy the Minimum Cash Condition. The closing of the Note Purchase Agreement is contingent upon the substantially concurrent consummation of the GSH Business Combination and subject to other customary closing conditions and terms set forth therein.
Extension and Redemptions
On January 25, 2023, we convened a special meeting of stockholders, where the stockholders approved an amendment, which we refer to as the “extension amendment,” to our certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which the company must consummate a business combination from January 28, 2023 to July 28, 2023. In connection with the vote to approve the extension amendment, the holders of 30,058,968 public shares (after giving effect to withdrawals of redemptions) exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately $304 million (approximately $10.12 per share) was removed from the trust account to pay such redeeming holders and following such redemptions, approximately $45 million remained in the Company’s trust account.
Approval of Initial Business Combination with GSH
On February 14, 2023, the GSH Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC. We established a record date of January 26, 2023 for the special meeting of stockholders to consider and approve, among other things, the GSH Business Combination. On March 23, 2023, we convened a special meeting of stockholders, where the stockholders approved the GSH Business Combination. In connection with the approval of the GSH Business Combination, stockholders holding 109,426 shares of Class A common stock (after giving effect to withdrawals of redemptions) exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the 

10



Company’s trust account. As a result, approximately $1.1 million (approximately $10.13 per share) will be removed from the trust account to pay such redeeming holders and approximately $43.9 million will remain in the Company's trust account.
Status as a Public Company
We are an “emerging growth company”, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following January 28, 2026, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we have focused our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we have closely scrutinized the management of GSH, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. At the consummation of the GSH Business Combination, David Hamamoto and Michael Bayles, two of our current directors, will serve on the board of directors of UHG, and Keith Feldman, one of our current directors, will serve as Chief Financial Officer of UHG. Following a business combination, to the extent that we deem it necessary, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management team of the target business. There is no assurance that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, such as GSH, we have encountered, and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in 

11



pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Human Capital Management
We currently have three officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs and intend to continue doing so until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our units, Class A common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this annual report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
