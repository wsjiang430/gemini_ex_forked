ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
DICK’S Sporting Goods, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, referred to as “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” unless specified otherwise) is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer offering an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. As of January 28, 2023, we operated 728 DICK’S Sporting Goods locations across the United States, serving and inspiring our customers, whom we refer to as athletes, to achieve their personal best through interactions with our dedicated employees, whom we refer to as our teammates, in-store experiences and unique specialty shop-in-shops. In addition to DICK’S Sporting Goods stores, we own and operate Golf Galaxy, Public Lands and Going Going Gone! specialty concept stores and offer our products both online and through our mobile apps. We also own and operate DICK’S House of Sport and Golf Galaxy Performance Center, as well as GameChanger, a youth sports mobile app for scheduling, communications, live scorekeeping and video streaming. 
We are celebrating our 75th anniversary as a Company in 2023 and are proud of our growth and accomplishments since our inception. We were founded and incorporated in 1948 in New York under the name Dick’s Clothing and Sporting Goods, Inc. when Richard “Dick” Stack, the father of Edward W. Stack, our Executive Chairman, opened his original bait and tackle store in Binghamton, New York. Edward W. Stack joined his father's business full-time in 1977 and in 1984 became President and Chief Executive Officer of the then two-store chain. In November 1997, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation, and in April 1999 we changed our name to DICK’S Sporting Goods, Inc. 
Our executive office is located at 345 Court Street, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania 15108 and our phone number is (724) 273-3400. Our website is located at dicks.com. The information on our website does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We include on the investor relations portion of our website (dicks.com/investors), free of charge, copies of our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified, any reference to “year” is to the Company’s fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday closest to the end of January each year.
Business Strategy 
Since 1948, our Company has believed in the power of sports to change lives, and we are committed to bringing this belief to life through our athlete experience, brand engagement, differentiated product, and most importantly, our teammates. With this belief as our foundation, our common purpose is to create confidence and excitement by inspiring, supporting, and personally equipping all athletes to achieve their dreams. Driven by this common purpose and our commitment to all athletes, our mission is to: 
•Create an environment where passionate and skilled teammates thrive;
•Create and build leading brands that serve and inspire athletes;
•Make a lasting impact on communities through sport; and
•Deliver shareholder value through growth and relentless improvement.
We believe that through this mission and the following key elements of our business strategy, we can be the best sports company in the world.
Reimagining the Athlete Experience 
We put our athletes at the center of everything we do, and we are committed to creating a unique and differentiated shopping experience for them. We seek to proactively manage our in-stock merchandise positions in our diverse category portfolio and elevate our merchandise presentation to provide a clear point of view for in-demand items, such as our premium full-service footwear departments, which are offered in nearly two-thirds of our DICK’S Sporting Goods stores as of the end of fiscal 2022. We provide a wide range of in-store support services and incorporate experiential elements and technology into our stores to better engage and serve our athletes, including our HitTrax® baseball simulators in nearly 200 stores and our investment in Trackman technology, which is used to enhance the fitting and lesson experience for our athletes in all of our Golf Galaxy stores. We also offer soccer shops in nearly 200 stores, which feature enhanced in-store elements including an elevated cleat shop, an expanded selection of licensed jerseys and soccer trial cages in select locations, which are all supported by especially trained in-store soccer experts to help better serve our athletes. 
We develop and test new store prototypes and concepts to grow our business, while incorporating key learnings into the rest of our chain. Since fiscal 2021, we have opened three DICK’S House of Sport stores, which are built around experience, service, community and product. In fiscal 2023, we plan to open nine additional DICK’S House of Sport stores, which will provide experiential destinations for our athletes, drive strong engagement with our key brand partners, and continue to set us apart as a clear market leader of the sporting goods industry. In fiscal 2021, we also launched our redesigned Golf Galaxy Performance Centers, which are equipped with Trackman and Biomech golf technologies and include an elevated staffing and service model to ensure our teammates become trusted advisors to golf enthusiasts of all levels. In addition to innovating within our core business, we launched Public Lands, an omni-channel specialty concept for our outdoor athletes, in fiscal 2021.
We continue to improve our service and selling culture, with an emphasis on engaging and inspiring our athletes. We provide our teammates with robust training to increase knowledge about our products, which builds confidence for our athletes through the power of our opinion and expertise. We equip our teammates with current technology to improve their productivity and enhance the athlete experience, including providing real-time product information, detailed product descriptions, inventory availability and alternative product recommendations as well as other metrics and communications while on the sales floor. 
Our marketing program is focused on inspiring athletes to participate in sports and building loyalty to DICK’S Sporting Goods through brand-building campaigns, including the expansion of our ScoreCard Rewards loyalty program. In fiscal 2019, we launched ScoreCard Gold, which provides our top-tier athletes with more ways to earn ScoreCard points and member-only benefits, including early access to sales and product launches. Our loyalty program has over 25 million active members who account for over 70% of total sales, which includes 7 million active Gold athletes who account for 40% of total sales. As of the end of fiscal 2022, we had over 150 million athletes in our database, including over 20 million new athletes in the past three years who skewed younger and more female. 
We leverage the robust data in our database to enhance the athlete experience by engaging our athletes through digital marketing and providing them with personalized offers and communications. We also use data science to improve the speed at which we deliver products to our athletes through optimized order routing and to enhance our in-stock and merchandise availability positions. Our GameChanger mobile app has also provided an opportunity for us to innovate within youth sports technology and connect with athletes and their communities by offering video streaming, highlights and scorekeeping for youth sports programs.
Optimizing Our Assortment to Meet the Needs of All Athletes
We carry a full range of products within each category, including premium items for the sports enthusiast. We believe our compelling industry-leading product assortment in each sporting goods category offers our athletes a wide range of good, better and best price points and enables us to address the needs of our athletes, from beginner to sports enthusiast, which distinguishes us from other large format sporting goods stores. We focus on those growth categories in which we believe an opportunity to gain market share exists. We support these growth categories, which have recently included the apparel, footwear, golf, and team sports categories, with greater quantities of enthusiast product and improved presentation and in-stock positions. 
We deliver a differentiated multi-brand experience to our athletes through our offering of national and vertical brands.
 National brands
We carry a wide variety of well-known brands, including but not limited to adidas, Asics, Brooks, Callaway Golf, Carhartt, Columbia, Easton, Hoka, Nike, On, Patagonia, Peloton, TaylorMade, The North Face, Titleist, Under Armour and Yeti. Our ability to showcase an entire brand portfolio is valued by our strategic partners, and our relationships with key brands provide access to wider, deeper and exclusive product offerings that provide authenticity and credibility to our athletes and that further differentiate us from our competitors. During fiscal 2021, we also partnered with Nike to provide a connected marketplace in our DICK’S mobile app which gives our athletes access to exclusive product, experiences and content.
Vertical brands
Our vertical brands include brands that we own across hardlines and softlines and are available exclusively in our stores and online such as Alpine Design, CALIA, DSG, ETHOS, Fitness Gear, MAXFLI, Nishiki, Quest, Top-Flite, VRST, and Walter Hagen, as well as brands that we license from third parties including adidas (baseball and football) and Prince (tennis). These brands offer high-quality, on-trend products to our athletes with compelling technical and performance attributes while providing differentiation in our merchandise assortment at higher gross margins as compared to sales of similar products from national brands. Our vertical brands are our second largest brand category, representing $1.7 billion, or approximately 14%, of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022. We consider our vertical brand strategy to be a key area of opportunity to increase productivity in our stores and online, and we have invested in a research, development and procurement staff to support its growth.
Our Improving Omni-channel Platform and Fulfillment Capabilities
We believe that when our athletes connect with the DICK’S Sporting Goods brand, they expect a seamless shopping experience, regardless of the manner in which they choose to shop with us. Like our athletes, we view retail as an omni-channel experience that seamlessly integrates our stores and online channels.
Our stores remain at the core of our omni-channel platform. We believe our store base gives us a competitive advantage over our online-only competitors, as our physical presence allows us to better serve our athletes by creating strong engagement through interactive in-store elements, offering the convenience of accepting in-store returns or exchanges and expediting fulfillment of eCommerce orders, the ability to place online orders in our stores if we are out of stock in the retail store, buy-online, pick-up in store, curbside pickup and return, and same-day delivery capabilities with Instacart or DoorDash, all while offering direct, live access to well-trained and knowledgeable teammates. In fiscal 2022, approximately 70% of online sales were fulfilled directly by our stores, which serve as localized points of distribution, and they enabled 90% of our total sales through online fulfillment and in-person sales. 
We continually improve the functionality and performance of our eCommerce sites and mobile app, which has included a faster and more convenient checkout process with new payment options, greater visibility and accuracy of delivery dates, improved page responsiveness, enhanced integration of our ScoreCard loyalty program, new content development through our Pro Tips platform and localized website experiences. Additionally, we continue to leverage our omni-channel platform, fulfillment centers and our delivery partnership with FedEx, which have enabled us to provide our athletes with faster delivery times. In fiscal 2022, we invested in our digital experience by expanding our personalization capabilities and other features, and we plan to continue building enhancements on those features to assist our athletes in finding the right product, at the right time. We also plan to continue investing in in-store technology to further enhance fulfillment efficiency with intelligence to improve in-stocks and merchandise availability, and by improving our speed to athletes with optimized order routing.
Merchandising
The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of our sales attributable to the following categories for the fiscal years presented:
 | Fiscal Year
Category | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Hardlines (1) | 40 | % | | 44 | % | 46 | %
Apparel | 34 | % | | 34 | % | 33 | %
Footwear (2) | 24 | % | | 21 | % | 19 | %
Other (3) | 2 | % | | 1 | % | 2 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %


(1)Includes items such as sporting goods equipment, fitness equipment, golf equipment and hunting and fishing gear.
(2)Includes athletic shoes for running, walking, tennis, fitness and cross training, basketball and hiking. In addition, this category also includes specialty footwear, including casual footwear and a complete line of cleats for team sports.
(3)Includes our non-merchandise sales categories, including in-store services, shipping revenues, software subscription revenues and credit card processing revenues.
Additional information about our sales categories is included within Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 1–Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Selling Channels
We offer products to our athletes through our retail stores and online, and although we sell through both of these channels, we believe that sales in one channel are not independent of the other. Regardless of the sales channel, we seek to provide our athletes with a seamless omni-channel shopping experience.
Retail Stores 
Our DICK’S Sporting Goods, Golf Galaxy and other specialty concept stores, including Public Lands, are designed to create an exciting and interactive shopping environment for the sporting enthusiast that highlights our extensive product assortments and value-added services. Each of our DICK’S Sporting Goods stores unites several sports specialty stores under one roof and typically contains the following specialty shops: Team Sports, Athletic Apparel, Outdoor, Golf, Fitness and Footwear. We believe our “store-within-a-store” concept creates a unique shopping environment by combining the convenience, broad assortment and competitive prices of large format stores with the brand names, differentiated product selection and customer service of a specialty store. We monitor and evaluate store performance on an ongoing basis and reallocate space in our stores to categories and products that we believe can drive sales growth, including our removal of the hunt department from many of our stores, in which we reallocated product space to a localized assortment of categories. In addition, we operate Going Going Gone! and Warehouse Sale stores, through which we are able to improve our clearance optimization through the consolidation of clearance inventory for omni-channel selling opportunities to better serve our value athletes.
We seek to expand our presence through the opening of new stores and believe that growing our store network and eCommerce business simultaneously will enable us to profitably grow the business by delivering an omni-channel shopping experience for our athletes. Approximately three-quarters of our DICK’S Sporting Goods stores will be up for lease renewal at our option over the next five years, which provides us with the opportunity to relocate, close, or renegotiate lease terms for these stores. In recent years, we have opportunistically opened new stores in under-penetrated markets and leveraged the significant flexibility within our existing real estate portfolio to capitalize on real estate opportunities as leases came up for renewal. While we plan to continue to leverage this flexibility to capitalize on future real estate opportunities, we plan to grow our square footage footprint in the upcoming year. Over the long-term, our DICK’S House of Sport stores will be the primary driver of this growth.
eCommerce 
Through our websites, we seek to provide our athletes with in-depth product information and the ability to shop with us at any time. We continue to innovate our eCommerce sites and applications with customer experience enhancements, new releases of our mobile and tablet apps, and the development of omni-channel capabilities that further integrate our online presence with our brick and mortar stores to provide our athletes with an omni-channel shopping experience. Currently, we have return-to-store capabilities for online orders, the ability to place online orders in our stores if we are out of stock in the retail store, buy-online, pick-up in store, and curbside pickup and return capabilities. Our websites also give us the ability to ship online orders from our retail locations, which reduces delivery times for online orders and improves inventory productivity and availability. 
Purchasing, Distribution and Customer Fulfillment
During fiscal 2022, we purchased merchandise from approximately 1,500 vendors, with Nike, our largest vendor, representing approximately 23% of our merchandise purchases. No other vendor represented 10% or more of our fiscal 2022 merchandise purchases. We do not have long-term purchase contracts with any of our vendors; all of our purchases from vendors are made on a short-term purchase order basis. 
We currently operate five regional distribution centers which enable us to supply stores with merchandise. Vendors ship floor-ready merchandise to our distribution centers, where it is processed and allocated directly to our stores or stored temporarily. Our distribution centers are responsible for consolidating damaged or defective merchandise from our stores that is being returned to vendors. We have contracted with common carriers to deliver merchandise from all of our distribution centers to our stores, which generally facilitates prompt and efficient distribution to our stores to enhance in-stocks, minimize freight costs and improve inventory turnover. During fiscal 2022, our stores received over 90% of their merchandise through our distribution network; the remaining merchandise was shipped directly to our stores from our vendors.
We leverage our store and distribution center network, two eCommerce fulfillment centers (one owned and one operated by a third-party, which we exited in February 2023) and direct shipping capabilities from our vendors to ensure merchandise delivery speed to our athletes and to minimize shipping costs. During fiscal 2022, we also maintained offsite storage locations following the supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19.
Competition 
The competition among retailers that sell sporting goods is highly fragmented. We compete with many retail formats, including large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores, specialty stores, mass merchants and department stores, online retailers, and vendors selling directly to consumers through retail stores and online. We seek to attract athletes by offering a wide range of products that enable us to address the needs of all athletes, from beginner to enthusiast, and by utilizing distinctive merchandise presentation in stores to create a unique shopping environment. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors by showcasing our and key partners’ brands through brand shops and giving access to wider, deeper and exclusive product offerings that provide authenticity and credibility to our athletes. We believe our store base gives us a competitive advantage over our online-only competitors, as our physical presence allows us to better serve our athletes by creating strong engagement. We also offer superior service both in-store and via a seamless omni-channel experience which includes buy-online, pick-up in store and curbside pickup and return capabilities. 
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal influences, including the holiday selling season and the impact of unseasonable weather conditions. Although our highest sales and operating income results have historically occurred in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, our business has increasingly been less affected by seasonal fluctuations in recent years. However, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the fiscal year.
Proprietary Rights 
We have a number of service marks and trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including various versions of the following: “Alpine Design”, “CALIA”, “DICK’S”, “DICK’S Sporting Goods”, “DSG”, “ETHOS”, “Fitness Gear”, “GameChanger”, “Golf Galaxy”, “The GolfWorks”, “MAXFLI”, “Monarch”, “Nishiki”, “Primed”, “Public Lands”, “Quest”, “ScoreCard”, “ScoreRewards”, “Top-Flite”, “VRST” and “Walter Hagen”.

Our service marks, trademarks and other intellectual property are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed within Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. 
We have also entered into licensing agreements for brands that we do not own, which provide for exclusive and/or non-exclusive rights to use names such as “adidas” (baseball and football) and “Prince” (tennis) for specified product categories or certain products and, in some cases, specified sales channels. These licenses are long-term business relationships and contain customary termination provisions at the option of the licensor including, in some cases, termination upon our failure to purchase or sell a minimum volume of products and may include early termination fees. Our licenses are also subject to general risks and uncertainties common to licensing arrangements that are described within Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. 
Governmental Regulations
We must comply with various federal, state and local regulations, including regulations relating to consumer products and consumer protection, advertising and marketing, labor and employment, data protection and privacy, intellectual property, the environment and tax. In addition, in connection with the sale of firearms in our stores, we must comply with a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to the sale of firearms and ammunition. Ensuring our compliance with these various laws and regulations, and keeping abreast of changes to the legal and regulatory landscape present in our industry, may cause us to expend considerable resources. For additional information, see the risk factors herein in “Item IA. Risk Factors.”
Social Responsibility 
In addition to our mission of supporting our athletes to achieve their dreams, we are committed to supporting youth sports in local communities. We sponsor thousands of teams in various sports and support the philanthropic efforts of our private corporate foundation, The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation. In partnership with The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation, in 2014 we launched our Sports Matter initiative, a philanthropic effort singularly focused on supporting youth sports. Through Sports Matter, we remain committed to addressing the barriers of participation in youth sports, including accessibility of equipment, safe recreational space to play, league costs to maintain youth sports programs in local communities and family registration fees often required for youth sport participation. Since the establishment of the Sports Matter initiative, the Company and The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation have committed over $170 million to help save thousands of youth sports teams and give more than one million young athletes across all 50 states the chance to play.
We also support The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation in expanding economic opportunities in local communities through programs established for education and the outdoors. During 2021, the DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation entered into a long-term partnership with a public school district located outside of Pittsburgh, PA to help serve the needs of students, families and staff in the community and create access to holistic resources and programming to support their education and well-being. Additionally, in partnership with The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation, we established the Public Lands Fund in 2021, which provides grants to local and national non-profit organizations that protect and maintain public lands, break down the barriers of access to outdoor experiences, and improve inclusion and equity in the outdoors.
We are also dedicated to supporting our teammates professionally and personally, as they are the core of our organization. In 2021, we established the Teammate Relief Fund, a public charity that provides financial support to teammates and their immediate families facing unexpected financial difficulty beyond their control. The Teammate Relief Fund is available to all DICK’S teammates and is funded by DICK’S Sporting Goods and teammate donations.
Human Capital Management
As of January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 18,800 full-time and 34,000 part-time teammates. Total employment figures fluctuate throughout the year and typically peak during the fourth quarter in alignment with the holiday selling season. None of our teammates are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
As stated in our mission, we strive to create an environment where dedicated, optimistic, authentic and high-integrity teammates thrive. We believe our teammates’ dedication to creating a positive experience for our athletes is what drives our success as a company, and we are committed to creating a great place to work for our teammates through competitive wages and benefits, promoting teammate safety, health and well-being, providing learning and career development opportunities and promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.
Wages and Benefits
In addition to offering our teammates competitive salaries and wages, we offer comprehensive health and retirement benefits to eligible teammates, which typically include all full-time hourly and salaried teammates. Our benefits include, but are not limited to, medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance, flexible paid time off programs covering parental and family leave, hybrid work arrangements, and a company-matched retirement savings 401(k) plan that vests immediately and is open for all teammates.
We are committed to equal pay for equal work independent of gender and race when establishing and maintaining wages. We achieved and maintained 100% female-to-male unadjusted median pay ratio in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. 
Safety, Health and Well-Being
We are committed to ensuring the safety, health and well-being of our teammates. We have robust policies, procedures and training in place to ensure a safe environment across our organization, including a comprehensive crisis management plan that allows us to respond immediately to critical incidents involving people, company assets, our business or our reputation. We provide support to our teammates to enable them to maintain and improve their professional and personal lives, which includes an employee assistance plan, an onsite health and fitness center, and a childcare facility at our corporate headquarters, which we refer to as our Customer Support Center (“CSC”). We also provide opportunities for volunteerism and launched our Teammate Relief Fund to offer additional support to our teammates experiencing hardship.
Training and Development 
We empower our teammates to develop their careers and provide tools that are necessary for them to reach their personal and professional goals. We have created rotational development programs in various functional disciplines to develop leadership pipelines and offer various live and recorded training programs across the organization based on job role and function, including safety, compliance, leadership or other skills, as well as store manager onboarding programs. We also provide tuition reimbursement programs for all eligible teammates to pursue a job-related degree at an accredited college or university, and we offer a part-time MBA program online in partnership with a local university. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to creating a workplace environment and culture that supports, celebrates and honors each individual and to promoting inclusion for all teammates. Doing so strengthens our ability to serve all of our athletes, drives innovation and growth, and enables us to attract and retain the best talent. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council, formed in 2019, is comprised of a group of teammates from across our organization who represent diverse backgrounds, roles, experiences and communities, and was formed to help steer and support our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Teammates with shared interests have come together in various resource groups to discuss shared experiences, increase awareness, offer mentorship to others and communicate with senior management. We use the feedback provided by our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, various resource groups, and other surveys provided to our teammates to foster an inclusive workplace. 
We have committed to increasing diversity at all levels of our organization. Consistent with this commitment, our Board of Directors includes women and people of color and reflects a diversity of background and experience in varying substantive areas relevant to our operations and industry.
