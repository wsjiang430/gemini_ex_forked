Item 1. Business
Overview

Milestone Scientific was incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 1989. Milestone Scientific has developed a proprietary, revolutionary, computer-controlled anesthetic delivery device, our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology® System, to meet the needs of various subcutaneous drug delivery injections and fluid aspiration – enabling healthcare practitioners to achieve multiple unique benefits that cannot currently be accomplished with the 160-year-old manual syringe. The device, using The Wand®, a single use disposable handpiece, is marketed in dentistry under the trademark CompuDent®, and STA Single Tooth Anesthesia System® and is suitable for all dental procedures that require local anesthetic. The dental devices are sold in the United States, Canada and in 38 other countries. Milestone Scientific also has 510(k) marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the CompuFlo® Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System in the lumbar spine region. In addition, certain medical devices have obtained CE mark approval and can be marketed and sold in most European countries.
 
Milestone Scientific is a biomedical technology research and development company that patents, designs, develops and commercializes innovative diagnostic and therapeutic injection technologies and devices for medical, and dental Since our inception, we have engaged in pioneering proprietary, innovative, computer-controlled injection technologies, and solutions for the medical and dental markets. We believe our technologies are proven and well established. Our common stock was initially listed on the NYSE American on June 1, 2015 and trades under the symbol “MLSS”. The Company is focused on building its intellectual; property portfolio across numerous indications.
 
The recent receipt of chronology-Specific CPT Code for the Company's technology by the American Medical Association marks an important milestone, that could increase the potential number of anesthesia pain management clinics adopting the CompuFlo instrument. A CPT code expands the potential for reimbursement of epidural procedures in pain management utilizing the CompuFlo Epidural System., which should help accelerate the commercial roll-out of CompuFlo in the U.S.
 
DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology; Our Proprietary Core Technology Platform
 
Given our experience and established brand awareness within the dental industry beginning with our first commercial product, the first computer-controlled local anesthesia delivery (C-CLAD) system marketed as the Wand® and re-branded as the CompuDent® System, now the market leader in dental injection technology, we elected to focus our product development efforts on improving the patient experience and making the device more versatile and precise for the practitioner.
 
Our next significant intellectual property advancement was a improvement over our CompuDent® System – the development of our proprietary CompuFlo® Computer-Controlled Drug Delivery System with DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology, an advanced and FDA-approved technology for the painless and accurate delivery of drugs, anesthetics, and other medicaments into all tissue types, as well as for the aspiration of bodily fluids or previously injected substances. Its regulation and control of the flow rate continues to provide painless delivery benefits, while its innovative dynamic pressure sensing capability provides visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback, identifying tissue types to the healthcare provider. This pressure feedback extends the benefit of painlessness from anesthetics with known viscosities to a wide range of liquid drugs and other medicaments with varying viscosities and flow rates. Such pressure feedback, part of our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology, also allows the healthcare provider to know when certain types of tissues have been penetrated and permits the healthcare provider to inject medicaments precisely at the desired location. Thus, real-time continuous pressure feedback can prevent the injection to tissue outside the intended target area, an important characteristic in the injection of chemotherapeutics and other toxic substances.
 In addition to the ability to determine exit pressure in-situ (in the injection site tissue) at the tip of the needle, minimizing tissue damage (and eliminating the pain of the injection) because the flow rate and pressure of the injection are precisely controlled, CompuFlo® computer-controlled Drug Delivery Systems features a proprietary algorithm, which allow for the measurement of the exit pressure. These algorithms contain the critical components of specific drugs, parameters of needles, tubing and syringes and all other pertinent components for the safe and efficacious delivery of medications for all procedures. CompuFlo® technology also enables devices to provide a digital record of the time and volume of anesthetic or medicament injected.
 
Each Wand/STA System also includes a disposable injection handpiece that is extremely comfortable, light, and easy to use, providing for precise tactile control during the injection, an electro-mechanical (computer-controlled) fluid delivery instrument and the ability to record data from the injection event. The pencil grip used with the handpieces provides the practitioner with enhanced tactile sense and accurate control and allows bi-directional rotation, eliminating needle deflection, resulting in a greater accuracy and success. The handpiece is vibration-free because it does not have a motor or electrical component in it and, since the handpiece does not look like a typical syringe, we believe it also reduces patient anxiety and offers the possibility of curing dental phobia of which an estimated 40 million Americans suffer.

As confirmed by numerous noted medical and dental experts within academia and the clinical practice arenas, CompuFlo Systems using DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology have the potential to greatly increase the safety and efficacy of many drug delivery procedures that currently rely upon the over 160-year-old hypodermic syringe technology and the tactile senses and delivery expertise of the administrator.
 
Devices using DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology such as the CompuFlo System can be used to inject a wide variety of liquid medicaments as well as anesthetics. We believe our CompuFlo System avoids the negative side effects from the use of traditional hypodermic drug delivery injection devices, which are well documented in dental and medical literature and include risk of death, transient or permanent paralysis, pain, tissue damage and post-operative complications. Pain and tissue damage often result from uncontrolled flow rates and pressure created during the administration of drug solutions into human tissue. While several technologies can control the flow rate, we believe our patented DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology and CompuFlo Systems provide the control of pressure during the injection as well accurately and precisely delivery the drug.
 
CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System
 
The CompuFlo Epidural Computer Controlled Anesthesia System (or the CompuFlo Epidural System) is one such platform extension of our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology platform, providing anesthesiologists and other healthcare providers the ability, for the first time, to quantitatively determine and document the pressure at the needle tip in real-time for proper needle placement in epidural procedures used for labor/delivery and back pain management. Our proprietary DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology allows the CompuFlo Epidural System to provide objective visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback that allows anesthesiologists to identify and confirm placement in the epidural space.
 
Our CompuFlo Epidural System provides an objective tool that we believe consistently and accurately identifies the epidural space by detecting the difference in pressure between the ligamentum flavum and the intrafilamentary tissue. In studies, the CompuFlo Epidural System with DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology has been shown to be effective in correctly identifying the epidural space. Knowing the precise location of a needle tip during an epidural injection procedure provides a measure of safety not presently available to doctors using conventional syringes. In the absence of fluoroscopy, identifying the epidural space by relying on the subjective perception of loss of resistance to saline requires a very long education period and learning curve and could result in morbidity and lack of efficacy. During back pain management epidural procedures, where fluoroscopy is commonly used, the CompuFlo Epidural System allows the clinician to locate the epidural space, without using fluoroscopy, thereby protecting the patient and clinician from unnecessary exposure to radiation along with significantly reducing capital and operating costs.
 
Wand/STA Dental Product
 
Since its market introduction in early 2007, the Wand STA System and prior C-CLAD devices have been used to deliver over 80 million safe, effective, and comfortable injections. The instrument has also been favorably evaluated in numerous peer-reviewed, published clinical studies and associated articles. Moreover, there appears to be a growing consensus among users that the STA Instrument is proving to be a valuable and beneficial instrument that is positively impacting the practice of dentistry worldwide.
Medical Market Product
 
During 2016, Milestone Scientific filed for 510(k) marketing clearance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for both intra-articular and epidural injections with the CompuFlo Epidural System.  In June 2017, the FDA approved the CompuFlo Epidural System for epidural injections.
 
In addition, the recent receipt of chronology-Specific CPT Code for the Company's technology by American Medical Association marks an important milestone, that could increase the potential number of anesthesia pain management clinics adopting the CompuFlo instrument. A CPT code expands the potential for reimbursement of epidural procedures in pain management utilizing the CompuFlo Epidural System., thereby helping accelerate the commercial roll-out of CompuFlo in the U.S. 
 
Cosmetic Botulinum Product
 
Milestone Advanced Cosmetic Systems, Inc. (“Advanced Cosmetic Systems”), was originally owned 50% by us and 50% by Milestone China Company Limited (“Milestone China”), a company organized under the laws of Hong Kong and initially owned 40% by Milestone Scientific. Milestone China contributed $900,000 of cash to the joint venture, and we have provided a royalty-free license to utilize our technology to the joint venture to develop a botulinum toxin injection device.
 
In November 2017, we announced plans for the commercial launch of our proprietary cosmetic injection device using our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology platform and our CompuFlo Cosmetic System for delivery of botulinum toxin. Our proprietary cosmetic injection device features improved needle placement with a comfortable stylus grip, precise dosing, the same technology platform that has made dental and epidural injections painless, and a new, intuitive touch-screen interface. Although the Company received positive outcomes of multi-state human factor studies with targeted customers, the Company did not have the necessary capital to move forward with the commercial launch of our cosmetic device and apply for marketing clearance in Europe (CE clearance), and United States (FDA clearance).

Other Possible Products
 
The Company is reviewing using CompuFlo’s DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology for less painful injections for use in rhinoplasty, colorectal surgery, podiatry, and other disciplines. In the self-injectable market, there are many injectable drugs routinely self-administered in a home or office setting using spring loaded automatic injection devices by people who suffer from long-term chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases of the auto immune system. We believe CompuFlo’s DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology, using pressure sensing capabilities, can serve as a less painless subcutaneous injection method for these self-administered drugs. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop any such products, or that if developed, that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to market any such products, or even if we do obtain such FDA approval, that any such products will generate any revenue for us or be a commercial success.
Ukraine
 
Sanctions imposed by the United States and other western democracies, because of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, and any expansion thereof, is likely to have unpredictable and wide-ranging effects on the domestic and global economy and financial markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As direct impact from the conflict, we have experienced a decrease in international sales to Ukraine and halted all sales to Russia. We will continue to monitor the situation carefully and, if necessary, take action to protect our business, operations, and financial condition. 
COVID-19 Pandemic
 
The COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affected the Company’s financial results and business operations during 2021. During the year 2022, the demand increased, and recovery of the dental business was seen, however, it is unclear what the effect other possible variants might have on the business during 2023. Therefore, such increased demand may or may not continue and/or demand may or may not increase from historical levels depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the transmissibility and severity of variants, the effectiveness of the on-going vaccination process, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. Such events may result in business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages, delivery delays, and reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop any such products, or that if developed, that we will be able to obtain FDA approval to market any such products, or even if we do obtain such FDA approval, that any such products will generate any revenue for us or be a commercial success. 


   The Company’s employees have been and are being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The health of the Company’s workforce is of primary concern and the Company may need to enact further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to the coronavirus. Further, our management team is focused on mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. If these conditions worsen, the Company’s ability to manage its business may be impaired, and operational risks, cybersecurity risks and other risks facing the Company prior to the pandemic may be elevated. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the Company’s customers, suppliers, vendors, and other business partners, but the Company is not able to predict the ultimate consequences that will result therefrom. 


   We are experiencing supply delays and shortages due to the disruptions the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is having on the global supply chain, especially with respect to goods from China. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant disruption to the operations of certain suppliers in China and the related transportation of their goods to the United States that are parts of our global supply chain. We have been able to make alternative delivery arrangements for limited quantities of goods, at increased cost. While we have not yet experienced material shortages in supply because of these disruptions and our alternative delivery arrangements, if they were to be prolonged or expanded in scope, there could be resulting supply shortages which could impact our ability to have manufactured and delivered our products to the United States and, ultimately to our customers. Accordingly, such supply shortages and delivery limitations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  All of these factors may have far reaching impacts on the Company’s business, operations, and financial results and conditions, directly and indirectly, including without limitation impacts on the health of the Company’s management.

Milestone Scientific relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. Despite the precautions taken by Milestone Scientific to protect its IP rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer, copy, or obtain and use products and information that Milestone Scientific regards as proprietary, or may design products serving similar purposes that do not infringe on Milestone Scientific’s patents. Milestone Scientific’s failure to protect its proprietary information and the expenses of doing so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
If Milestone Scientific’s products infringe upon patent or proprietary rights of others, we may be required to modify processes or to obtain licenses. There can be no assurance that Milestone Scientific would be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
Manufacturing
 
Milestone Scientific has informal arrangements with an U.S. manufacturer of the Wand/STA System, and epidural devices. Pursuant to these informal arrangements, our third-party manufacturer manufactures the Wand/STA System under specific purchase orders without minimum purchase commitments, and at prices to be agreed upon in each such purchase order.
 
Our agreement with the principal manufacturer of dental handpieces includes pricing terms. Milestone Scientific has been supplied by the manufacturer of the Wand/STA System and its predecessor, the CompuDent System, since the commencement of production in 1998, and by the manufacturer of its dental handpieces since 2003. The manufacturer of our dental handpieces is in the People’s Republic of China and the manufacturer of the Wand/STA System is in the United States. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Changes to pricing of the Wand/STA System instruments by the manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and results of operations. Termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these third-party manufacturers could significantly and adversely affect our ability to produce and sell the products.
 
Though other alternate sources of supply for dental handpieces exist, Milestone Scientific would need to establish relationships with new suppliers, and with respect to the Wand/STA System recover its existing tools or have new tools produced and “burn in” and other manufacturing and quality control software re-produced. Establishing new manufacturing relationships could involve significant expense and delay. Any curtailment or interruptions of supply, whether as a result of the inability of a supplier to meet our product delivery needs or termination of the relationship, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and results of operations.
 
Distribution and Marketing
 
Dental Products
 
The Company has used a combination of exclusive and non-exclusive distributors to sell its dental products.  In the United States and Canada the Company’s largest distributor was Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry Schein”).  In December 2021, Henry Schein’s exclusive distribution arrangement with respect to the Wand STA System became a non-exclusive distribution arrangement for the United States and Canada, and on December 31, 2022 such non-exclusive distribution arrangement terminated.
 
In anticipation of such termination, in January 2021, the Company began a process of signing non-exclusive dental distribution arrangements with dental distributors in specific geographical locations in the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2022, there are twelve new non-exclusive dental distributors engaged in the United States and Canada. In addition, the Company developed its own United States direct distribution channel which was launched in January of 2023.
 
On the global front, we have granted exclusive marketing and distribution rights for the Wand STA System to select dental suppliers in various international regions in Asia, Africa, South America, and Europe. Additionally, the Company is in the process of evaluating current international distributors and adding new distributors globally as required based on the economics of the region.
 
Medical Product
 
The company, markets and sell it’s medical products in the international markets such as Italy, Switzerland, Greece, Canada and the Middle East through exclusive distributors. In the United States the Medical products are sold by a direct sales team of 3 full time employees and CTI a medical distributor covering 22 states.
Competition
 
As of this filing, there is no subcutaneous drug delivery platform or device on the market regulating the flow rate and pressure of an injection capable of delivering a painless injection at the desired location like Milestone Scientific’s proprietary, patented devices having our DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing technology.

Milestone Scientific’s devices compete based on their performance characteristics and the benefits provided to the patient, practitioner, and their business operations. Clinical studies have shown that our devices reduce fear, pain and anxiety for many patients, and Milestone Scientific believes that they can reduce practitioner stress levels, as well. Other computer-controlled local anesthesia delivery (C-CLAD) options are the Quicksleeper and SleeperOne, from Dental Hi Tec, Dentapen from Septodant, the Calajet from Aseptico, and the Comfort Control Syringe by Dentsply. In the medical segment, for needle verification and placement the EpiFaith Syringe made its market entry in 2023.
 
The Quicksleeper was invented in France by Dr. Alain Villette in 1991. It is marketed as the only local anesthetic delivery device in France that allows the ability to perform all intraoral local anesthetic injection techniques, including osteocentral anesthesia, quickly and without failure. The extra feature that gives the Quicksleeper this ability is a built-in motor in the syringe/handpiece that renders the syringe both an injector and a perforator of bone. That is, the handpiece of the Quicksleeper can perform an intraosseous injection via a motor driven perforation of the cortical plate of bone. A standard dental needle that attaches to the syringe spins as the motor rotates the handpiece thus acting as a perforator. However, the handpiece is relatively heavy, weighing 240 g. as compared to a standard syringe that weighs 80 g. Injection speed increases during the injection, but the operator cannot control when the injection speed increases.
 
The Calajet instrument, manufactured in Europe, has been very slow to grow market acceptance. It recently began marketing in the United States with similar slow acceptance. The instrument is a higher price than the Wand STA and does not provide dynamic pressure sensing technology. Although a competitor, we believe that without a substantial distribution network this instrument will have a difficult time to be successful in the United States.
 
The Dentapen from Septodent is the newest competitor in the market. This device is manufactured in Europe and began marketing in the United States in 2018. This device is priced similar to the Wand/STA device, but at this time, to our knowledge, it has been slow to attract viable distribution in the United States.
 
The EpiFaith Syringe claims to assist the physicians in entering the epidural space. The instrument is introduced at a lower price. Although a potential competitor, we believe that our technology is well documented and is the only pressure sensor guidance system for epidural analgesia assisting the physician over the entire trajectory of epidural needle placement and catheter verification.
 
Milestone Scientific’s proprietary, patented devices with its DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology platform also compete with disposable and reusable syringes that generally sell at lower prices and that use established and well-understood methodologies in both the dental and medical marketplaces.
 
Rapid technological change and research may affect our products. Current or new competitors could, at any time, introduce new or enhanced products with features that render our products less marketable or even obsolete. Therefore, Milestone Scientific must devote substantial efforts and financial resources to improve existing products, bring products to market quickly, and develop new products for related markets. In addition, the ability to compete successfully requires that Milestone Scientific maintain an effective distribution network with a strong marketing plan. Any new products must comply with applicable regulatory authorities before they may be marketed. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that it can compete successfully, that competitors will not develop technologies or products that render our products less marketable or obsolete, or, that Milestone Scientific will succeed in improving its existing products, effectively develop new products, or obtain required regulatory approval for those products.
 
Government Regulation
 
The manufacture and sale of medical devices and other medical products are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration  ("FDA") pursuant to the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”), and by other federal, state, and foreign authorities. Under the FD&C Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance before they can be marketed commercially in the United States. Some medical products must undergo rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing and an extensive FDA approval process before they can be marketed. 
 
These processes can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The time required for completing such testing and obtaining such approvals is uncertain, and FDA clearance may never be obtained. Delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in FDA policy during the period of product development and FDA regulatory review of each product submitted. Similar delays also may be encountered in other countries. Following the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments to the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in May 1976, the FDA classified medical devices in commercial distribution into one of three classes. This classification is based on the controls necessary to reasonably ensure the safety and effectiveness of the medical devices. Class I devices are those devices whose safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through general controls, such as adequate labeling, pre-market notification, and adherence to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), also referred to as “Good Manufacturing Practices” (“GMP”) regulations. Some Class I devices are further exempted from some of the general controls. Class II devices are those devices whose safety and effectiveness reasonably can be ensured using special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines. Class III devices are those which must receive pre-market approval by the FDA to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices.
 
    8 

  
Prior to Pre-market Notification clearance, the manufacturer or distributor may not place the device into commercial distribution until an order is issued by the FDA. By regulation, the FDA has no specific time limit by which it must respond to a 510(k) Pre-market Notification. Currently, the FDA typically responds to the submission of a 510(k) Pre-market Notification within 180 days. The FDA response may declare that the device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device and allow the proposed device to be marketed in the United States. However, the FDA may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent or may require further information, such as additional test data, before the FDA is able to decide regarding substantial equivalence. Such determination or request for additional information could delay market introduction of products. If a device that has obtained 510(k) Pre-market Notification clearance is changed or modified in design, components, method of manufacture, or intended use, such that the safety or effectiveness of the device could be significantly affected, separate 510(k) Pre-market notification clearance must be obtained before the modified device can be marketed in the United States. If a manufacturer or distributor cannot establish that a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the manufacturer or distributor will have to seek pre-market approval of the proposed device, a more difficult procedure requiring extensive data, including pre-clinical and human clinical trial data, as well as extensive literature to prove the safety and efficacy of the device.
 
The FDA cleared the Wand, our CompuDent System, and its disposable handpieces, for marketing in the United States for dental applications in July 1996; the CompuMed® System for marketing in the United States for medical applications in May 2001; the Safety Wand® for marketing in the United States for dental applications in September 2003; the Wand/STA System for dental applications in August 2006; and our CompuFlo Epidural System in June 2017.
 For us to commercialize other products in the United States, Milestone Scientific would have to submit and have cleared additional 510(k) applications to the FDA. In 2017, the FDA reduced the barrier to marketing clearance for certain dental devices. As a result, other manufacturers of injection devices could more easily enter the dental market. However, we believe that any new device will be very limited in sales volume without a significant distributor in the dental market.
 
Though certain dental and medical devices have received FDA marketing clearance, there can be no assurance that any of the other medical devices under development will obtain the required regulatory clearance in a timely manner, or at all. If regulatory clearance of a product is granted, such clearance may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, modifications may be made to the products to incorporate and enhance their functionality and performance based upon new data and design review. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not request additional information relating to product improvements; that any such improvements would not require further regulatory review, thereby delaying the testing, approval, and commercialization of product improvements; or that ultimately any such improvements will receive FDA clearance.
 
Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer, including fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
 
Milestone Scientific is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, whose regulations require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain QSR requirements as defined by the FD&C Act. QSR compliance requires testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Failure to comply with QSR requirements can result in the suspension or termination of production, product recall or fines and penalties. Products also must be manufactured in registered establishments. In addition, labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The export of devices is also subject to regulation in certain instances.
 
The Medical Device Reporting (“MDR”) regulation obligates us to provide information to the FDA on product malfunctions or injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of the product or in connection with certain product failures that could cause serious injury. If, because of FDA inspections, MDR reports or other information, the FDA believes that Milestone Scientific is not in compliance with the law, the FDA can institute proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and/or criminal penalties against us, our officers, or employees. Any action by the FDA could result in disruption of operations for an undetermined amount of time.
 
In May 2022, the Company initiated a Corrective Action Preventative Action (CAPA) investigation of the Epidural Disposable Kit, Part # 6100-01, lot HC 51, the scope of the voluntary market withdrawal needed to be expanded to include Part # 6100-03, lot HC 50. A new non-conformance was initiated, and Lot HC 50 was added to the scope of the CAPA initiated above. The investigation via the CAPA identified that there is an issue with the id adaptors used in both lot’s HC 51 and HC 50. However, the Health Hazard Evaluation shows that there is no risk to the patient or the user, thus management has determined there are no potential impacts to patients or users. Lot’s HC 51 and HC 50 are worth approximately $22,000 and $10,000 respectively. Management has determined that no other lots were affected.
 
In May 2022, the Company was notified that Wand STA handpieces, reference # STA—5050-2725, lot B210113 were packaged incorrectly. The Company initiated a Corrective Action Preventative Action (CAPA) investigation to determine the root cause and implement corrective actions. The Health Hazard Evaluation was completed and showed that there is no risk to the patient or the user due to this discrepancy, thus management has determined there are no potential impacts to patients or users. However, to provide the highest quality products to the market, Milestone Scientific decided to initiate a voluntary market withdrawal on May 13, 2022. Lot B210113 is worth approximately $25,000.
