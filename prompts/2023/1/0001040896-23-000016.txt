Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
We were originally incorporated in the state of New York in 1994 as Intelli-Check, Inc. In August 1999, we reincorporated in Delaware. On March 14, 2008, our corporation was renamed Intelli-Check - Mobilisa, Inc. after the consummation of the merger with Mobilisa, Inc. (“Mobilisa”) (references to “Intelli-Check” in this annual report refer to the Company prior to the merger with Mobilisa). At the closing of the merger, our headquarters were moved to Mobilisa’s offices in Port Townsend, Washington. On October 27, 2009, we made a further change in our name to Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc. On May 4, 2017, with the approval of our shareholders, we changed our name to Intellicheck, Inc. (“Intellicheck,” “we,” “our,” “us,” or “the Company”). On August 31, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of the common stock of Positive Access Corporation (“Positive Access”), a developer of driver license reading technology. The acquisition of Positive Access expanded the Company’s technology portfolio and related product offerings and allowed the Company to reach a larger number of customers through Positive Access’s extensive distribution network. On December 31, 2018, we formally merged the Mobilisa and Positive Access subsidiaries into one corporation under the name Intellicheck, Inc.
We are a prominent technology company that delivers on-demand digital identity validation solutions for KYC, fraud, and age verification needs. We validate both digital and physical identities for financial services, fintech companies, BNPL providers, e-commerce, and retail commerce businesses, law enforcement and government agencies across North America. Our software solutions can be used through a mobile device, a browser, or a retail point-of-sale scanner.
We plan to expand our business in the near term by pursuing a strategy designed to increase market share in our existing markets and expand into new product markets that are expected to benefit from fraud prevention and identity validation. For example, we have extended our technologies into online applications to provide identity validation and fraud prevention for the billions of transactions that occur online each day. We have also incorporated biometric, facial recognition and other enhancements to several of our current product offerings in order to stay on the leading edge of technology.
We plan to leverage our intellectual property in the markets we are targeting to strengthen our competitive position.
Our primary businesses include Identity Systems products, which include commercial applications of identity card reading authentication.
Our technologies address problems such as:
■Commercial Fraud and Risk Management – which may lead to economic losses to financial institutions and merchants from check cashing, debit and credit card transactions, account take overs, e-commerce as well as other types of fraud such as identity theft that principally use fraudulent identification documents as proof of identity;
■Instant Credit Card Approval – retail stores and financial institutions use our technology to scan a driver license at a kiosk or at the Point of Sale (POS) to confirm that an applicant is who they claim to be with additional certainty. Once confirmed that the driver license is valid, the transaction can proceed to the underwriting stage where qualified applicants can get instant approval for a loyalty-branded credit card. This technique protects consumer data and is significantly more likely to result in a completed transaction compared to in-store personnel asking customers to fill out a paper form and then entering the data;
■Age Restricted Product Access – Products validate driver licenses and other government forms of identification to confirm the age of customers purchasing age restricted products. Target industries include alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, gambling, bars and nightclubs. 
■Unauthorized Access – our systems and software are designed to increase security and deter terrorism at airports, shipping ports, rail and bus terminals, military installations, high profile buildings and infrastructure where security is a concern; 
■Fraudulent Retail Purchase Returns – Implementing our validation software solutions can prevent fraudulent retail returns in situations where customers are seeking store credit or cash compensation for items being returned without a receipt when the transaction requires a driver license for identification; and
■Inefficiencies Associated with Manual Data Entry – by reading encoded data contained in the bar code and magnetic stripe of an identification card with a quick swipe or scan of the card, where permitted by law, customers are capable of accurately and instantaneously inputting information into forms, applications and the like without the errors associated with manual data entry.
IDENTITY CARD READING AND VERIFICATION SECTOR
Background on Identification Documentation
Driver license
The driver license is the most widely used form of government issued photo identification in North America. The Real ID Act, which became federal law in May 2005, recognizes that the driver license is also a quasi-identification card. In addition to its primary function, the driver license is used to verify identity for social services, firearm sales, check cashing, credit card issuance and use and other applications. Our technology can read the digitally stored barcode information on all currently issued driver licenses even those that do not comply with the standards of the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (“AAMVA”), the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”) and the International Standards Organization (“ISO”). Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia and all 13 Canadian provinces/territories digitally store information on their driver license.
Non-driver identification card
Each U.S. and Canadian Jurisdiction also provides a non-driver identification card as an alternative form of identification for those unable to acquire a driver license. These identification cards are issued with most of the same data found on a driver license. Military documents and passports also provide a means of identification and contain encoded data as well. Since driver licenses are the most widely used form of legally acceptable government documentation, we refer to all these identification documents as “driver licenses.” Our software can perform its function on all these forms of identification.
Current Challenges Associated with Verifying Identification Documents
The high-tech revolution, coupled with the staggering amount of personal information available from data breaches, has created a major problem for those who rely on identification documents. In an age where high-tech scanners, computers and color printers are commonplace, and where personal information is so cheap to purchase off of the 'dark web', fake IDs of the highest quality with the identity theft victim’s actual information on the document are easily obtainable from many locations including college campuses and from multiple sites on the Internet. These fakes appear so real, even law enforcement agencies have encountered difficulty distinguishing them from legally issued documents. Additionally, high-tech equipment can easily alter properly issued forms of ID. Therefore, anyone can gain access to a false identity that gives them the ability, in a commercial transaction, to present fake and stolen credit cards or checks that are supported by false identification. Additionally, starting with only a fraudulent driver license, an individual may be able to create multiple credit accounts, commit fraud, buy age restricted products such as alcohol, tobacco and cannabis while underage, evade law enforcement and engage in other criminal activities, such as:

•committing identity theft | •gaining entrance to high profile buildings and sensitive infrastructures 
•improperly boarding airplanes | •engaging in medical fraud 
•committing credit card, debit card and check cashing fraud | •purchasing age restricted products such as alcohol, cannabis and tobacco while underage 
•illegally purchasing firearms | •obtaining welfare or other government benefits. 


•unlawfully committing pharmacy fraud including false narcotic prescriptions; and
•committing refund fraud 

Given the ease with which identification can be falsified, simply looking at a driver license may not be sufficient to verify age or identity and determine if it is fraudulent. Since merchants and financial institutions are facing significant economic losses due to these frauds, we believe that a document authentication system which can accurately read the digitally stored information is needed. We possess patented technology that provides an analysis of the data contained on the encoded formats of these identification documents by reading and analyzing the encoded format on the magnetic stripe or bar code on the driver license and comparing it against known standards.
OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
Our Products and Services are generally sold as Software as a Service (“SaaS”) where customers pay for our cloud-based service.
Identity Systems Products and Services
Our Identity Systems are marketed to the Commercial, Retail, Financial and Government identification sectors.
Commercial Identification
Intellicheck® Platform
The Intellicheck Platform is a complete identity solution that checks whether an ID is valid, matches the ID to the person presenting it, and provides a risk score to help determine the risk of doing business with that person. It is designed to be used in online and retail settings using devices that can include a mobile phone or tablet, a PC or retail scanner. The Intellicheck Platform is designed to address the needs of users across a variety of use cases including account access, account openings, receipt-less returns, receipt of delivery, age restricted purchases and more.
Validating the ID
Using its own proprietary technology, Intellicheck utilizes an iOS or Android phone, or a retail scanner to read and verify the encoded format contained on U.S. and Canadian driver licenses, state issued non-driver identification cards, military IDs and passports. Our technology has the ability to verify the encoded formats on all currently encoded documents, even those that do not comply with the standards of the AAMVA, ANSI and ISO.
Using integrated third-party technology, Intellicheck offers the ability, through certain platforms, to scan and verify over 10,000 documents around the world including drivers licenses, state identity documents and passports.
Our Intellicheck Platform can quickly determine if:
•the format of the document is valid;
•the document has been altered or is fake, by displaying the parsed, encoded data for comparison with the printed information;
•the document has expired; or
•the encoded data contains a date of birth equal to or greater than the legal age to purchase age restricted products, such as alcohol, vaping, cannabis and tobacco.
Matching the person to the ID
Intellicheck integrates third party software to provide the ability to match a selfie of a person to the picture on the driver license. These facial biometrics capabilities allow the Intellicheck platform to check for likeness to ensure that static photos are not being used as a stand-in for the user on both ends of the match, in addition to the ability to match the ID 
photo to the selfie and provide a match score. This capability is integrated into the Intellicheck platform to allow for fast deployment and is an option for platform subscribers.
Determining the risk score
The Intellicheck platform offers the ability to analyze data or signals to determine the risk of doing business with the person on the identity document. Intellicheck provides access to a wide variety of data signals including device fingerprinting, IP address, phone number, time zone, geographic location and more to analyze, using machine learning, the risk of doing business with that person.
How the Platform is Delivered
The Intellicheck Platform consists of the following elements:
•IDN-Portal
•IDN-Portal is an Intellicheck-branded identity validation application that can be typically set-up for a user in under an hour. It provides the ability to scan an ID using a mobile phone or tablet. IDN-Portal provides the flexibility to allow the Intellicheck customer or their customer to perform the scan and enables the Intellicheck customer to manage their application online using the PC.
•IDN-Portal+
•IDN-Portal+ starts with all the features of IDN-Portal in addition to the ability to perform a facial biometrics test to match the picture on the ID to a selfie of the user presenting the ID. Additionally, Portal+ offers global document validation, retail POS integration, additional data for analytics and analysis and online validation among other features. 
•IDN-Direct
•IDN-Direct provides the capabilities of the Intellicheck platform within the users own apps and integrated with their systems. IDN-Direct is accessible through the Intellicheck API to aid integration into customer applications and systems. IDN-Direct also provides an SDK to simplify integration into the user’s mobile applications. IDN-Direct provides access to additional data and also provides the ability to use the platform’s Risk Score capability to help with decision-making.
•Intellicheck Mobile
•Intellicheck Mobile is the pre-build iOS and Android application for use by purchasers of IDN-Portal and IDN-Portal+. The Intellicheck Mobile app provides that the ability to login and scan an ID. The app also, depending on the level of Intellicheck service purchased has access to additional data once the document has been analyzed.
Advantages of the Platform
•Fast results
•The Intellicheck platform provides results of an ID scan in under a second. Facial biometrics may add additional seconds to the process.
•Fast deployment
•With IDN-Portal or IDN-Portal+, customers can typically be up and running in under an hour.
•Accurate ID validation
•For North American documents, Intellicheck provides market-leading identity validation accuracy. Accuracy that can remove the need for manual review, and accuracy that leading businesses use to enable real time processes. For the rest of the world, Intellicheck provides best of breed document accuracy.
State Aware Software
Our patented State Aware Software solution provides or restricts information that is electronically scanned from an ID based on the electronic reading laws according to the state in which the ID is scanned. For example, scanning an ID in New Hampshire for law enforcement purposes is allowed, whereas electronically scanning an ID for a mailing list is not allowed. With all the various uses of scanning and verifying an ID, it is important for responsible users to be aware of the different state laws. State Aware Software incorporates each state’s requirements around electronic capture of ID barcode data directly into hosted Intellicheck Platform.
Data Collection Devices
Our software products are designed for use with multiple data collection devices, which are commercially available in various compact forms and may contain either one or both of 2-D bar code and magnetic stripe readers. These devices enable our software applications to be used on a variety of commercially available data processing devices, including credit card terminals, PDAs, tablets, laptops, desktops, mobile phones, and point-of-sale terminals. Many of these devices contain an electronic serial number (ESN) to prevent unauthorized use of our software.
Instant Credit Application Kiosk Software Applications
These are custom software applications that Intellicheck developed for a variety of major financial service companies and retail stores. The software installed on multiple kiosk devices provides the customers of the major financial service companies and retail stores with the ability to perform in-store instant credit approval on these devices. The hardware platforms, on which the software applications run, range from stationary devices to handhelds to tablet PCs. The process involves the swiping or scanning of the driver license to verify the encoded format and after verification, the information parsed from the encoded data is populated into the proper fields on the application displayed on the kiosk. The applicant then completes the application by entering the remaining required information that is not encoded on the driver license, such as social security number and telephone numbers. The software application then sends the data to the financial service company’s backend “decisioning” tool for credit approval. If approved, the applicant is granted instant credit which can then be used to make purchases.
Upgrade Capability
Our Intellicheck Platform products and related databases are constantly updated to stay current with identification formats and new forms of ID.
STRATEGY
Our objective is to be a leading identity verification company providing world class solutions in the identity sector. These solutions include our commercial identity systems focusing on workflow, productivity enhancement, fraud protection and risk management segments. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Commercial Systems
Productivity Enhancement. We market our technology as a key productivity enhancement tool. Our proprietary Intellicheck Platform software can add functionality to virtually any given software application to automatically populate fields within a given form, when a government-issued photo ID is presented. Our ability to correctly read and authenticate all U.S. jurisdictions, coupled with our proprietary technology, is a key differentiator from our competitors. The automation resulting from the intelligence added to the form dramatically increases throughput and data integrity, and it significantly enhances the customer’s experience.
Develop Additional Strategic Alliances with Providers of Security Solutions. We have entered strategic alliances to utilize our systems and software as the proposed or potential enrollment application for their technologies and to jointly 
market these security applications with multiple biometric companies. Some of these companies have included Lenel, AMAG Technology, Inc., in the defense industry; Zebra Technologies hardware manufacturers; and Idemia Identity & Security USA, facial biometrics companies Ipsidy and Applied Recognition. We are an associate member of AAMVA and a member of AAMVA’s Industry Advisory Board. We believe these relationships will broaden our marketing reach through their sales efforts and we intend to develop additional strategic alliances with additional providers of security solutions.
Strengthen Sales and Marketing Efforts. We intend to capitalize on the growth in demand for document verification and productivity enhancement by continuing to market and support our systems and software. Our sales and marketing departments are organized by region and specifically named accounts to provide focus and proximity to build solid long-term relationships. Our recent focus has been on SaaS license arrangements in the financial services, retail, and hospitality services industries.
Enter into Additional Licensing Agreements. We intend to continue to license our software for use with a customer’s system. We are currently licensing our SDK software product for Windows, iOS, Android and other operating system platforms and intend to similarly continue to license our PC software solutions. Our software is intended to be used with a compatible hardware device. We have entered into multiple licensing agreements to date.
Protect Intellectual Property. We intend to protect our intellectual property portfolio to preserve value and obtain favorable settlements where warranted.
Our Revenue Sources
We derive our revenue primarily from the following sources:
■Sales of our systems by both our own direct sales force and marketing partners;
■Per transaction or fixed price (SaaS) revenue from the licensed use of our technology;
■Extended warranties on equipment; and
■Other subscription and Support Services, such as jurisdictional updates to certain commercial customers and support services.
Our Target Industry Sectors
Commercial Identity Systems
The use of false identification cards, primarily driver licenses and non-driver identification cards, to engage in commercial fraud, to gain access to unauthorized areas and to gain entry to critical infrastructure is all too common and the problem is growing with each passing day. Given the ease with which identification can be falsified, we believe that simply looking at a driver license is not sufficient to verify identity and determine if such an identification card is fraudulent. Since merchants and financial institutions are facing significant economic losses due to these frauds, we believe that what they need is a document authentication system that can accurately read the digitally stored information. We target the industry sectors that we believe would benefit most from our systems and software.
We also market our products to opportunities where our Intellicheck Platform technology can be used to enhance productivity. We have made significant progress in the sectors for the retail issuance of instant credit. We believe there are financial benefits and compelling business models for customers in this sector to utilize our technology.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Commercial Identity Systems
Our objective is to become a leading developer and distributor of document and age verification software. To date, our marketing efforts have been through direct sales by our sales and marketing personnel, through resellers and license agreements. We are marketing our products through direct marketing approaches such as web marketing, a small number of select trade shows and well-known public interest and trade associations.
We generate revenues from the licensing of our software and to a much lesser extent the selling of bundled solutions that contain hardware and software. Depending on the specific needs of our clients, we tailor the right solution for them.
Our Intellicheck Platform software is available to customers via the cloud (SaaS) and is available for Microsoft Windows, Android and iOS platforms in addition to devices such as credit card terminals and other operating systems such as Linux. We are marketing our Intellicheck Platform technology to financial institutions, mass merchandisers, government, airlines, airports, high profile buildings or infrastructure, grocery, convenience and pharmacy chains, and casinos.
We have developed a comprehensive marketing plan to build customer awareness and develop brand recognition in our target industry sectors. We promote the advantages and ease of use of our products through:

■Endorsements by nationally known public interest groups and trade associations; | ■Web seminars, as well as our own website; and 
■Trade publications; | ■Various conventions and industry specific seminars.
■Trade shows; | 

We intend to continue to develop and market other related software applications.
MAJOR CUSTOMERS
Although the composition of our largest customers has changed from year to year, a significant portion of our revenues have been attributable to a limited number of major customers. In 2022, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 72% of total revenues. In 2021, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 79% of total revenues. While we believe that one or more major customers could account for a significant portion of our sales for at least the next two years, we anticipate that our customer base will continue to expand and that in the future we will be less dependent on major customers.
REGULATION
The sale and use of our Identity System products are subject to regulation, such as on data protection and storage, by government authorities. We work on an ongoing basis with our customers to facilitate their compliance with such regulations. Additionally, we believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable United States federal laws, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment.
COMPETITION
Commercial Identity Systems
We compete in an industry that is intensely competitive and rapidly changing. Unless a device can read, decode and analyze all the information that is legally permitted to be analyzed, which is digitally stored within the barcode on a driver license, the user may not obtain accurate and reliable confirmation that a driver license is valid and has not been altered or tampered with. We are aware of several companies that are currently offering products that electronically read and calculate age from a driver license. We have tested and compared some of these products to the Intellicheck Platform and believe that our product is superior in quality and functionality. We believe that units unable to read bar codes are at a 
significant disadvantage because all states and Canadian provinces currently utilize bar codes to encode their driver licenses, as well as all U.S. military IDs and uniformed services cards.
We have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition in the document verification sector. If any of our competitors were to become the industry standard or were to enter or expand relationships with significantly larger companies through mergers, acquisitions or otherwise, our business and operating results could be seriously harmed. In addition, potential competitors could bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products.
MANUFACTURING
We do not manufacture readers or input devices but use products from several manufacturers. Some of these devices are private labeled and programmed by the supplier to work with our Intellicheck Platform technology. Most of our hardware consists of commercial off-the-shelf (“COTS”) products. We rely on a small number of suppliers to provide our COTS products.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Our research and development efforts are mainly concentrated in the area of identity verification. Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Research and development expenses also include consulting fees, software and subscription services, and a portion of our third-party cloud infrastructure expenses incurred in maintaining our platform.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We currently hold eighteen (18) U.S. patents and one (1) Canadian patent. At present, we have three patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. These patents cover commercially important aspects of our capabilities relating to the authentication and verification of identification documents. We will continue to pursue patents for all our new technologies arising from our research and development efforts.
In January 1999, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted us a patent on our ID Check® software technology. In October 2002 and July 2005, we were granted additional patents that are a continuation of our patents relating to our document authentication and age verification technology. Upon our acquisition of the assets of IDentiScan, we received equitable ownership and sole ownership rights to its intellectual property, including other patents and patent applications relating to age verification technology.
During 2010, we were granted two additional patents. The first patent was for a software key control for mobile devices. It is used to get a registration key for the parser that is based on the unique internal ID of one mobile device. The Mobile Key Manager communicates with the mobile device, reading its ID, and then requests a registration key specific for that ID from Intellicheck's server. This server maintains a database of all customers using IDecode Mobile Parsers, including the number of licenses they have purchased, the latest software version for which they have paid support, and the registration keys and unique device IDs associated with those licenses. The server generates a new registration key unique to the device ID and returns it to the Mobile Key Manager to register that device. In this way, the customer can deploy the IDecode Mobile Parser to only one mobile device for each parser purchased.
The second patent was related to a document comparison system and reinforces the innovative nature of Intellicheck’s security solutions involving documents. The technology described in the patent relates to a system and method for comparing information contained in at least two documents. For example, information on at least two different documents can be compared to determine whether the information is the same on each document. For instance, a name contained on an individual’s driver’s license is automatically compared with a name contained on the individual’s airline boarding pass.
In 2012, we were granted a patent relating to a system and method for comparing information contained in at least two documents, but not limited to just a driver license and passport. This patent compares “like information” on different documents to determine whether the information is the same on each document. As an example, a passport is compared to a boarding pass to determine if “like information” matches, for instance name and birthdate.
In 2014, we were granted one patent that was also a continuation of an earlier-filed application. The patent is related to a document comparison system that compares information contained in two documents to determine whether certain information is substantially identical on each document. The system provides a positive or negative indication as to whether portions of the two documents are substantially identical.
In 2015, we acquired an intellectual property portfolio that includes four patents involving technologies for checking the validity of identification documents using a remote database. Certain patents in this portfolio address the use of biometric information and identification credentials as part of the process to control access to a secured area.
In 2016 we were granted one patent in Canada that was a continuation of an earlier filed application and is related to identity matching in response to threat levels.
In 2018, we were granted one patent that was also a continuation of an earlier filed application to a document comparison that compares information contained in multiple documents.
We were granted two patents in 2019 that were a continuation of earlier filed applications. The first patent is related to checking the validity of identification documents using a remote database. The second patent related to identification scanning in compliance with jurisdictional or other rules.
In 2020, we were granted two patents that were a continuation of earlier filed applications. The first patent is related to checking the validity of identification documents using a remote database. The second patent is related to document comparison that compares information contained in multiple documents.
In 2022, we were granted two patents that were a continuation of earlier filed applications. The first patent is related to using a mobile device to perform verification of a selfie to a photo on an identification document. The second patent is related to a system and method for document comparison that compares information contained in multiple documents.
We own multiple copyrights in the United States, which are effective in Canada and in other major industrial countries. The copyright protection covers software source codes and supporting graphics relating to the operation of the Intellicheck Platform and other software products. We also have several trademarks relating to our company, its product names, and logos.
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of March 28, 2023, we had 53 full-time employees. Four are engaged in executive management such as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Technology Officer, twenty-five in information technology including those participating in our research and development efforts, fourteen in sales and marketing, four in customer and support integration, and six in administration. All employees are employed “at will.” We believe our relations with our employees are generally positive and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any labor unions.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purposes of our equity compensation and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel, whether existing employees or new hires, through the granting of equity and cash-based compensation awards. We believe that this increases value to our stockholders and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and their families with access to convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security giving them peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented and have continued significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the community in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations, including working in a remote environment where appropriate or required.
