ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview



We are an outsourced marketing solutions provider, working closely with our customers to develop sophisticated marketing programs that leverage our promotional products and loyalty incentive expertise. We develop long-term relationships with our customers, enabling them to connect with both their customers and employees in order to build lasting brand loyalty. It is our mission to drive brand awareness and affect behavior through visual, creative, and technology solutions.



We purchase products and branding through various third-party manufacturers and decorators and resell the finished goods to customers. In addition to selling branded products, we offer our clients custom sourcing capabilities; a flexible and customizable e-commerce solution for promoting branded merchandise and other promotional products, managing promotional loyalty and incentives, print collateral, and event assets, order and inventory management, and designing and hosting online retail popup shops, fixed public retail online stores, and online business-to-business service offerings; creative and merchandising services; warehousing/fulfillment and distribution; print-on-demand; kitting; point of sale displays; and loyalty and incentive programs.



These valuable services, as well as the deep level of commitment we have to the business operations of our customers, have resulted in a strong and stable position within the industry.



We specialize in managing complex promotional marketing programs to help recognize the value of promotional products and branded merchandise as a tool to drive awareness, build brands and impact sales. This form of advertising is very powerful and impactful and particularly effective at building brand loyalty because it typically uses products that are considered useful and appreciated by recipients and are retained and used or seen repeatedly, repeating the imprinted message many times without adding cost to the advertiser. We have built the tools, processes, relationships and the blueprint to maximize the potential of these products and deliver the most value to our customers.



For over 27 years we have grown into a leader in the promotional products industry, ranking 36th in 2021 revenues in the United States on Print+Promo Marketing’s 2022 Top Distributors list, and 34th on ASI’s Top 40 Distributors 2022 list. Our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Shape, was also recently ranked 45th on ASI’s 2022 Power 50 list of influential people in our industry. Since our first year of operations in 1995, our annual revenues have gradually grown from approximately $240,000 to $59.0 million in 2022, a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22.6%, and between 2017 and 2022, our revenues grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 24.4%. During 2017 through 2022, we had consistent gross margins of approximately 30%, and processed more than 50,000 customer orders per year.



As of December 31, 2022, we had total assets of $56.6 million with total stockholder equity of $39.4 million.



We serve a highly diversified customer base across many industry verticals including pharmaceutical and healthcare, manufacturing, technology, finance, construction and consumer goods. Many of our customers are household names and include some of the largest corporations in the world.



Our sales increased 48.5% year-over-year in 2022 compared to 2021, which we believe was primarily due to higher spending from existing clients as well as business from new customers. Additionally, we benefited from the acquisition of the G.A.P. Promotions, LLC, or G.A.P. Promotions, assets in January 2022, the assets of Trend Promotional Marketing Corporation (d/b/a Trend Brand Solutions), or Trend Brand Solutions, in August 2022, and the assets of Premier Business Services, or Premier NYC, in December 2022. We expect going forward that pent-up demand from more widespread immunity to the COVID-19 virus, the return of many significant in-person tradeshows and other industry-related opportunities, and societal reopening in general may help compensate for lower sales in prior periods. However, these trends are expected to be partially offset by continued increases in expenses, especially higher raw material costs and a more challenging supply chain. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Producer Price Index for final demand moved up 4.6% for the 12 months ended in February, 2023, on an unadjusted basis. In addition, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant adverse effects on our industry and our company, and that it may continue to do so. For further discussion, see “—The COVID-19 Pandemic’s Effects on the Promotional Products Industry” and “—The COVID-19 Pandemic’s Effects on Our Business” below.



Our headquarters are located at Quincy, Massachusetts, with additional offices located in Warsaw, Indiana; Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina; and Tomball, Texas. We also have sales representatives in 17 additional locations across the United States and a network of service providers in the U.S. and abroad, including factories, decorators, printers, logistics firms, and warehouses.

Our Industry



Overview of Promotional Products Market



The promotional products industry is large yet highly-fragmented, with thousands of smaller participants and indications of a lack of market power in any one firm or group of firms. The industry has generally experienced growth as businesses continuously invest in sophisticated marketing campaigns involving multiple types of advertising. Promotional products are items used to promote a product, service or company program including advertising specialties, premiums, incentives, business gifts, awards, prizes, commemoratives and other imprinted or decorated items. They are usually given away by companies to consumers or employees. The largest promotional products trade organizations are the Advertising Specialty Institute (ASI) and Promotional Products Association International (PPAI).



U.S. Promotional Products is a Large and Growing Market



According to ASI, the U.S. market for promotional products reached $25.8 billion in 2022, matching the previous high achieved in 2019 and growing 11.2% from 2021. Moreover, the promotional products market is only one segment of a total addressable market of possibly up to $380 billion based on the size of the product packaging market ($185 billion as of 2021, according to Mordor Intelligence, a leading market intelligence and advisory firm); the loyalty incentive programs market ($90 billion annually according to the Incentive Marketing Association, the umbrella organization for suppliers in the incentive marketplace); the printing market ($83 billion projected for 2023, according to IBISWorld, an industry research provider); and the trade show and conference planning market ($22 billion projected for 2023, according to IBISWorld).



We believe that U.S. promotional products spending was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to ASI, promotional product distributor sales decreased nearly 20% from $25.8 billion in 2019 to $20.7 billion in 2020. However, the return of in-person events, businesses aggressively marketing themselves and 40-year-high inflation resulted in promotional products distributor sales increasing 12.1% in 2021 to $23.2 billion and 11.2% in 2022 to $25.8 billion, matching the last full year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.



The Promotional Products Industry Is Resilient To Other Forms of Advertising



The promotional products industry is relatively insulated from other forms of advertising such as television and digital advertising. Although promotional products compete for space within an advertising budget with other forms of advertising, particularly online advertising, they offer distinct benefits, particularly due to their physical nature, which may help distributors and suppliers continue to sell these products and related services despite these budgetary pressures. Data shows that promotional products are more effective in generating brand recognition and sales than other forms of advertising, including television and online advertisements. These factors help shield established industry firms like ours from the technological and competitive disruption experienced by other types of media advertisers.
The Promotional Products Industry is Highly Fragmented



The promotional products industry is also highly fragmented. As of 2018, the industry included over 40,000 firms according to PPAI. As of 2022, the firm with the greatest percentage of industry sales generated $1.1 billion in revenue but made up only approximately 4.4% of the $25.8 billion in revenues generated in 2022 by North American promotional products distributors, based on information reported by ASI and the firm itself. There are only two firms that have reported achieving revenues above $1 billion in 2022. As a group, the top 40 distributors had approximately 32.7% market share as of 2021, based on total sales of approximately $7.6 billion out of total North American promotional products distributors’ revenues for 2021 of $23.2 billion, based on ASI’s reports.



Unlike our company, which provides comprehensive solutions to complex promotional and branding challenges, we view most of our competitors as generally falling into one of the five categories below:




● | Online e-tailer. Heavily rely on marketing and online advertising to sell directly to businesses, offering little or no strategic support or program infrastructure.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






2








● | Franchise Model. Consists of many smaller firms or independent representatives without a consistent strategic vision. They do not offer consistent pricing and have fragmented service capabilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large and Inflexible. Focus on large enterprise customers, struggling to serve the needs of smaller spend opportunities (less than $3 million annually). They tend to lack in delivering a high level of service and are limited in their ability to react to changes in the market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Non-Core Offering. Offer promotional merchandise as an add-on to their core business or have grown through acquisition without any unification strategy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Small Mom-and-Pop. Have little or no infrastructure or executive oversight. Do not have the financial backing, technology, or infrastructure to support growth or ability to execute comprehensive marketing programs or large opportunities. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Promotional Products are a High-impact, Cost-effective Advertising Medium



Because promotional products are useful and appreciated by recipients, they are retained and used, repeating the imprinted message many times without added cost to the advertiser. ASI’s Global Ad Impressions Study, 2020 Edition, reported:

● | Promotional products are the most highly regarded form of advertising, more than newspapers, radio, magazine, television, Internet, or mobile ads. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Up to 85% of promotional products recipients remember the advertiser worldwide. Recall is highest for apparel items, as 85% recall the advertiser that gave them a shirt or hat. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 40% of consumers who own promotional products report that they have kept some for more than 10 years, suggesting that businesses using promotional products may generate long-term revenues and other valuable goodwill from them. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nearly one-quarter (23%) of consumers reported that they purchased a promotional product in the last year, showing one way that promotional products can be cost-effective advertising tools. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In 2018, PPAI reported that promotional products are the most impactful form of advertising across all generations. Whereas reportedly less than 55% of consumers read or watch an entire advertisement online, in an email, on television, in the mail, in a magazine, or on the radio, over 80% of consumers retain promotional products. Moreover, promotional products have been ranked the most effective form of advertising across all generations, outranking even television, online, print, and mobile forms. A 2019 PPAI report revealed additional statistics reflecting the significant impact of promotional products on consumers:




● | 96% of consumers like to know ahead of time when companies offer promotional products. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Eight out of ten consumers enjoy receiving promotional products. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seven in ten consumers would like to receive promotional products more often. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 79% of consumers, including over a third of Millennials and 20% of Generation Z consumers, pass on promotional products that they no longer want, increasing their potential reach and effectiveness. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Nearly all consumers say they would go out of their way to receive promotional products.



As of 2016, PPAI reported that, overall, buyers consider promotional products mostly or always effective in achieving marketing goals. They generally consider promotional products more effective than social media and nearly as effective as all other media. Data indicates that the majority of buyers do have a budget set aside for promotional products. However, for more than 72% the allocation is less than 20% of their marketing advertising budget. When asked what their plans were for promotional products spend over the next 12 months, only 3% projected a decrease in product purchases. This data suggests that the potential for promotional products’ market growth is significant.

The COVID-19 Pandemic’s Effects on the Promotional Products Industry



As in many other industries, we believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has weakened many promotional products distributors. According to ASI, promotional product distributor sales decreased nearly 20% from $25.8 billion in 2019 to $20.7 billion in 2020. However, the return of in-person events, businesses aggressively marketing themselves and 40-year-high inflation resulted in promotional products distributor sales increasing 12.1% in 2021 to $23.2 billion and 11.2% in 2022 to $25.8 billion, matching the last full year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, distributors have also experienced higher costs of supplies of product materials due to continued increases in expenses, especially higher freight charges and raw material costs, and a more challenging supply chain from issues such as trucking shortages and port congestion. Much of the increase in costs, supply chain disruption, and other continuing disruptions in operations is believed to be due to ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19. We expect some or all of these effects to continue in 2023.
The COVID-19 Pandemic’s Effects on Our Business



We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Stran’s operational and financial performance. As was typical for other firms in the promotional products industry, from March 2020 through the end of 2022, we believe that our revenues were adversely affected by decreased demand for promotional products and services such as ours due to a lack of in-person events, businesses not being fully reopened and staffed, and customers’ decreased marketing budgets. We also experienced higher costs of supplies of product materials due to continued increases in expenses, especially higher freight charges and raw material costs, and a more challenging supply chain from issues such as trucking shortages and port congestion. Much of the increase in costs, supply chain disruption, and other continuing disruptions in operations is believed to be due to ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19. We expect some or all of these effects to continue in 2023.



We have also noted that some of our customers have indicated that a greater number of their employees work from home than in past periods. We believe this increase may be partially a result of the relatively new risk to office work from the COVID-19 pandemic, and that this trend may continue. As a result, we have been, and expect to continue to, drop-ship more materials directly to people at their homes than in periods before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that this trend will continue to yield increased freight service fees and fulfillment revenue as well as associated costs.

 We have responded to the challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a clear company-wide strategy and sticking to our hardworking culture and core value of delivering creative merchandise solutions that effectively promote our customers’ brands. We continue to focus on our core group of customers while providing additional value-added services, including our e-commerce platform for order processing, warehousing and fulfillment functions, and propose alternative product offerings based on their unique needs. We also continue to solicit and market ourselves to long-term prospects that have shown interest in Stran. We have remained committed to providing our customers with more than just products. Below are some of the specific ways we have responded to the current pandemic:




● | Adhered to all state and federal social distancing requirements while prioritizing health and safety for our employees. We allow team members to work remotely when necessary, allowing us to continue providing uninterrupted sales and service to our customers throughout the year.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Emphasized and established cost savings initiatives, cost control processes, and cash conservation to preserve liquidity.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Explored national acquisition opportunities and executed the acquisitions of the promotional products assets and business of Indiana-based Wildman Imprints with historical revenue exceeding $10 million annually in September 2020, Massachusetts-based G.A.P. Promotions with 2021 revenue of approximately $7.2 million in January 2022, Texas-based Trend Brand Solutions with annualized 2022 revenue of approximately $3 million in August 2022, and New York-based Premier NYC with annualized 2022 revenue of approximately $2 million in December 2022. In addition, entered into a definitive agreement in January 2023 to purchase the promotional products business and assets of Massachusetts-based T R Miller Co., Inc. (“TRM Corp.”), with historical revenue of approximately $19 million.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Retained key customers through constant communication, making proactive product or program suggestions, driving program efficiencies, and delivering value-added solutions to help them market themselves more effectively.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Concentrated and succeeded in earning business from clients in specific verticals that have spent more during the pandemic including customers in the entertainment, beverage, retail, consumer packaged goods, and cannabis industries.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






4








● | Retained key employees by continuing to provide them with competitive compensation and the tools required to be successful in their jobs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Successfully applied for and received Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) loans and government assistance.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Refocused our marketing activities on more client-specific revenue generating activities that reduced spend while remaining effective.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that we have seen encouraging signs of recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been a significant increase in the amount of requests for proposal and other customer inquiries since the beginning of 2021, which leads us to believe that companies are preparing to spend at previous or increased levels. We expect going forward that pent-up demand from more widespread immunity to the COVID-19 virus and societal reopening will help compensate for lower sales in prior periods. However, significant lingering supply chain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to adversely affect our business in 2021 and 2022, and may continue to do so in 2023.



For a further discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, please see the discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and in particular the subsection entitled “Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic”, and Item 1A. “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Industry – Our business has been materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could be materially adversely impacted by future COVID-19 pandemic surges, new COVID-19 variants, or other pandemics.”



Competitive Strengths



We believe our key competitive strengths include:




● | Superior and Distinctive Technology. We have invested in sophisticated, efficient ordering and logistics technology that provides order processing, warehousing and fulfillment functions. We continue to invest in our technology infrastructure, including many customized solutions developed on Adobe Inc. (“Adobe”)’s open-source e-commerce platform, Magento Open Source. We have also invested in an internal commercial Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, Oracle/NetSuite’s NetSuite ERP, which is expected to enhance the process of gathering and organizing the business data of our company through an integrated software suite, and is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2023.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Leading Market Position. Our over 27 years’ history and size make us a leader in the U.S. promotional products industry. We believe that the key benefits of our scale include an ability to efficiently implement large and intensive programs; an ability to invest in sales tools and technologies to support our customers; and operating efficiencies from our scalable infrastructure. We believe our market position and scale enhances our ability to increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and enter into new markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensive Network. We have developed a deep network of collaborator factories, decorators, printers, and warehouses around the globe. This network helps us find the right solution to meet our customers’ needs, whether they are financial, timing, geographic, or brand goals. This model provides the flexibility to proactively manage our customers’ promotional needs efficiently. As a result, we believe that we have an excellent reputation with our customers for providing a high level of prompt customer service.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer-Centric Approach. Our customer-centric approach is what has fueled our growth since our inception and our early adoption of technology to solve challenges for our clients set us apart in our early growth. We strive to understand the goals and challenges that our customers face, building unique solutions and seeing each campaign through to completion as an extension of their team.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversified Customer Base. We sell our products to over 2,000 active customers and over 30 Fortune 500 companies, including long-standing programs with recurring revenue coming from well recognized brands and companies. Our largest customer accounted for 8.8% and 7.5% of overall revenue during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our top 10 customers in 2022 and 2021 contributed 42.5% and 44.8% of revenue, respectively. Our customers span many industries, including pharmaceutical and healthcare, manufacturing, technology, finance, construction and consumer goods.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Experienced Senior Management Team. Our senior management team, led by our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Shape, is comprised of seasoned industry professionals and veterans of our company. Our senior management has an average of over 20 years of experience in the promotional products industry.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Asset Acquisition Experience. In September 2020, we acquired all of the customers of the promotional products business Wildman Imprints in an asset purchase. In 2019, that business recorded over $10 million in revenue. In January 2022, we purchased the promotional products business and assets of G.A.P. Promotions, with 2021 revenue of approximately $7.2 million. In August and December, 2022, we also acquired the promotional products businesses and assets of Texas-based Trend Brand Solutions and New York-based Premier NYC, respectively. In January 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the promotional products business and assets of Massachusetts-based TRM Corp. We continue to explore and pursue additional acquisition opportunities that are appropriate. Please see “—Growth Strategies – Selectively Pursue Acquisitions” below for a discussion of our asset acquisition experience and strategy.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies



The key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:




● | Selectively Pursue Acquisitions. We believe that we are well-suited to capitalize on opportunities to acquire businesses with key customer relationships or have other value-added products or services that complement our current offerings. Our acquisition strategy consists of increasing our share in existing markets, adding a presence in new or complementary regions, utilizing our scale to realize cost savings, and acquiring businesses offering synergistic services such as printing, packaging, point of sale (POS) displays, loyalty and incentive program management, and decoration, or offering additional differentiators. In September 2020, we acquired all the customer account managers and customer accounts of the promotional products business Wildman Imprints in Warsaw, Indiana. As a result, we gained approximately over 1,400 customer accounts, including over 120 customer programs with higher repeat-business potential; 20 additional employees; inventory worth approximately $650,000 with a majority covered by contractual customer purchase guarantees; and additional revenues of over $10 million as of 2019. This acquisition allowed us to extend our geographical reach into the Midwest and further diversify our customer base. In January 2022, we acquired the promotional products business and assets of G.A.P. Promotions in Gloucester, Massachusetts. From this acquisition, we expanded our major beverage-specific customer accounts; hired 13 additional employees; gained inventory worth approximately $90,000 with claw-back guarantees; and gained a business with sales of approximately $7.2 million as of 2021. In August 2022, we acquired the promotional products business and assets of Trend Brand Solutions in Houston-area Tomball, Texas. From this acquisition, we diversified and expanded our customers’ geographic accounts; gained eight additional employees; acquired inventory worth approximately $124,000 with claw-back guarantees; obtained a warehouse with kitting and fulfillment capabilities; and gained a business with annualized sales of approximately $3 million as of 2022. In December 2022, we acquired the promotional products business and assets of Premier NYC in Larchmont, New York. From this acquisition, we acquired a business with annualized sales of approximately $2 million as of 2022 and a number of noteworthy customers including several large law firms and a national stock exchange.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that this experience will help us to pursue suitable acquisition opportunities in the future and integrate them successfully. Consistent with this strategy, we continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets, particularly with the following attributes:




o | Geographic balance, with a focus on acquiring a company in the branded merchandise space based in the western United States (including Texas, California, Colorado, Oregon, or Washington state) in the $5-10 million revenue range;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Smaller promotional companies in the $2-5 million revenue range who lack the programmatic capabilities but have a minimum of 30% gross margins and comparable or improved profitability; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Businesses with complimentary offerings to increase Stran’s portfolio of services and depth of expertise in these additional industries: Packaging; Loyalty & Incentive; Decorators (for screen printer, embroidery, direct-to-garment, rub-on transfers, etc.); and Event/Tradeshow Services.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovate and Invest in Technology. We continue to invest in upgrades to our platform for customers’ promotional e-commerce objectives, including customizable and scalable features, developed on Adobe’s open-source e-commerce platform, Magento Open Source. We have also invested in an internal commercial ERP system, NetSuite ERP, which is expected to enhance the process of gathering and organizing the business data of our company through an integrated software suite, and is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2023. We believe that it is necessary to continue focusing on the buildout of our technology offerings in order to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Additionally, our strong technology platform will support our acquisition strategy to integrate acquired businesses into our existing platforms. We intend to continue making significant investments in research and development and hiring top technical talent.

● | New Client Development. Our sales and marketing teams are tasked with continuously growing their books of business by nurturing existing business relationships while actively seeking new opportunities with new customers. We will continue to promote and ask for referrals from satisfied customers who often refer us to other potential clients. We continuously seek to build our sales forces through hiring of experienced individuals with established books of business as well as hiring less-experienced individuals that we hope to develop into productive sales representatives. As we continue to grow, we are hiring sales representatives in different geographies across the U.S. that further diversify our customer base and attract new customers. Currently we have employees or sales reps located in offices or remotely in Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. In addition to direct sales and marketing efforts, we have organized, and plan to expand, an inbound prospecting lead generation team that includes industry veterans, as well as digital marketing. This new dedicated lead generation team will be further supported by an integrated and aggressive digital marketing strategy and paid-search advertising efforts. We believe this sales and marketing initiative will enable us to expand into new markets and industry verticals. We will continue to build sales and marketing campaigns to promote Stran, including social media, search engine optimization (SEO), HubSpot Inbound Marketing, and other alternative platforms. We also plan to continue to identify and exhibit at appropriate tradeshows, conferences, and events where we have had success.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop and Penetrate Customer Base. We plan to further expand and leverage our sales force and broad product and service offering to upsell and cross-sell to both develop new clients and further penetrate our existing customer base. Many of our services work together and build on each other to offer greater control and consistency of our customers’ brands as well as improved efficiency and ease of use for their team. Our goal is to become an extension of our customers’ team and to support their organizations in using physically branded products in the most effective means possible. For example, we can offer a one-stop solution for all tradeshow and event asset management objectives. From pre-show mailings to special event uniforms, we can help design as well as produce and manage all tradeshow materials and processes from start to finish. With multiple warehouses strategically located throughout the United States, we offer logistics solutions and expertise to effectively fulfill customers’ events needs across the country. The internal inventory-management version of our e-commerce platform provides the ability to manage not only a customer’s assets for its booth or event setup, but also its literature, giveaways, uniforms, and more. We will ship out all assets with return labels for post-show logistics and establish standard operating procedures for every asset to be returned back into inventory.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Other strategies that we plan to implement to expand our customer base with expanded sales staff and technology resources include:




o | Convert Transactional Customers to Programs. The majority of our revenue is derived from program business, although only a small percentage of our customers are considered programmatic. For the years 2022 and 2021, program clients accounted for 82.2% and 75.7% of total revenue, respectively. Less than 350 of our more than 2,000 active customers are considered to be program clients. With a larger sales force and other resources, we believe we can convert more of our customer base from transactional customers into program clients with much greater revenue potential. We define transactional customers as customers that place an order with us and do not have an agreement with us covering ongoing branding requirements. We define program clients as clients that have a contractual obligation for specific ongoing branding needs. Program offerings include ongoing inventory, use of technology platform, warehousing, creative services, and additional client support. Program customers are typically geared towards longer-lasting relationships that help secure recurring revenue well into the future.

o | Strengthen Marketing and Social Media Outreach. We plan to expand sales and marketing tools and campaigns to promote the Company, including further expanding our inbound prospecting team, and enhancing our digital marketing efforts, including paid search advertising, social media platforms, such as Instagram, and other alternative marketing platforms.

o | Demand Generation. During 2022, we initiated a comprehensive demand generation strategy and plan to continue dedicating resources to this initiative. The strategy includes both traditional outbound sales such as cold calling, advertisements and direct email, and inbound prospecting of leads, based on organic generation of customer interest with targeted ads and information, focused on identifying and capitalizing on revenue-generating opportunities in previously unexplored or underexplored industry verticals. Our strategy encompasses the piloting of an inbound sales team, expansion into new markets through organic and pay-per-click marketing, and other initiatives. Our demand generation team will continue to leverage new campaigns alongside our product development and global sourcing capabilities to attract and convert multiple high-quality leads. Given our premier reputation and the fragmented nature of our industry, we believe we are ideally positioned to rapidly grow our market position as a leader in our industry, serving many of the leading Fortune 500 companies in the country.

o | Tradeshows and Events. We plan to increase our exhibitor presence at appropriate shows and events such as ProcureCon Marketing, Association of National Advertisers Brand Masters Conference, Association of National Advertisers Masters of B2B Conference, National Beer Wholesalers Association (NBWA), Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America: AccessLive, Bar Convent Brooklyn, New England Cannabis Convention (NECANN), Marijuana Business Conference and Cannabis Expo (MJBizCon).

o | Extend Relationships. We plan to identify and approach more print, fulfillment, and agency collaborators to sell into their customer base.

o | Referrals. We believe we will generate more customer referrals by offering an enhanced loyalty and customer incentive program.

Products and Services



Overview



Since our inception over 27 years ago, we have provided clients with marketing services that help drive sales, and make an impact using custom-branded merchandise, commercial print, loyalty and incentive programs, packaging and point of sale solutions while providing a technology solution to deliver these products and services efficiently via our warehouse and fulfillment system.



Our value to our customers is to be an extension of their own teams. We work to understand the different business and marketing goals of each customer and provide solutions that incorporate technology, human capital, and physical branded goods to solve their business challenges. This model of outsourced combined marketing and program-management services is unique in the promotional products industry, which is dominated by online e-tailers, franchisees, and mom-and-pop businesses. To achieve this value, we have built the internal resources, knowledge, and processes to support our clients with more than just commodity items.



We are both program managers and creative marketers, having developed multiple teams within our organization to specialize and focus our efforts on supporting customers with the specific support that they need:




● | Operations and e-commerce teams create custom-tailored technology solutions that enable our clients to view, manage and distribute branded merchandise to their appropriate audience in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Account teams work with client stakeholders to understand goals, objectives, marketing and human-resources initiatives, and the ongoing management of the account.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In-house creative agency and product merchandising teams support the account team to provide unique and custom product ideas along with additional design services such as billboards, annual reports, and digital ad assets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Merchandising team as well as members of our account teams attend trade shows domestically and internationally across a variety of markets, allowing us to provide a diverse assortment of product offerings to our clients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technology and program teams offer technology solutions to help efficiently manage the order process, view products and inventory available, distribute products in the most cost-effective manner, and provide reports and metrics on the activity of the account.

We work closely with industrial designers of several of our key collaborators to understand the research and trends that are influencing product development in the six- to 18-month window ensuring that our team is up-to-date on trends in the industry.



Promotional Product Programs



We run complex corporate promotional marketing programs for clients across many different industry verticals. Most of our clients take advantage of all the services we provide; however, at the core of every program are the promotional products themselves. Our team works diligently to stay on point with the current trends so our clients’ branded products are relevant. We distribute a wide variety of promotional products to our customers, with the most popular promotional products including wearables, writing utensils, drinkware, technology and events-related products.
Loyalty and Incentives Programs



We build custom solutions for customers looking to drive either customer or employee behavior. We help our customers build a customer loyalty program or an employee incentive program that meets each customer’s specific needs. Our solutions can include gamification tools, social media integration, and a points-based plan that rewards clients’ users with a combination of physical products, digital rewards, gift cards, and experiential rewards nurturing loyalty to their brand. For example, we worked closely with a global producer of vaccines and medicines for animals, to design and implement a two-tier incentive program in which, on one tier, veterinarians were incentivized to purchase from our customer through providing them with promotional branded products, and, on a second tier, a loyalty points program featuring prepaid debit card rewards for end-user pet owners who buy their products.



In developing our loyalty and incentive offering, Stran has taken a similar approach as we have in other areas of our business. Instead of developing our own internal solutions organically, we have sought out relationships with businesses with a variety of offerings that meet the very different needs of each of our customers. By using a collection of third party providers, we are able to offer a more robust technology solution that meets the constantly evolving and changing needs of our incentive users.



Packaging and Point of Sale



Presentation makes all the difference. Clever and custom packaging point of sale, or POS, displays are essentials for elevating brand awareness and critical for driving sales. From packaging of corporate merchandise and promotional products to developing custom POS displays, clients come to us when they want to stand out and show the quality that their brands offer. We produce custom packaging and POS projects domestically as well as overseas for larger-run custom programs for many of our clients.



Commercial and Digital Printing



Printed informational materials used for marketing, or marketing collateral, such as business cards and brochures, are an essential component to effectively conveying information and marketing messages, and arguably all businesses use some form of marketing collateral. When a customer needs print collateral, our digital print-on-demand options route their orders through our technology platform and to our network of commercial printers to ensure that our customers can print each piece of collateral in the most effective and efficient manner. By offering print management with our promotional branded merchandise solutions, we help our customers create impactful presentations and mailings through the most efficient processes.
Warehouse and Fulfillment 



We offer a global solution for warehousing and fulfillment through a network of fulfillment providers including a nearly ten-year relationship with industry leader Harte Hanks. These long-standing, strategic relationships provide our clients with process-driven fulfillment solutions that are scalable to meet client needs including real-time inventory reporting, climate-controlled facilities, high-value product security, storage, digital print-on-demand, and direct-mail solutions. Our custom front-end technology solution is directly integrated with the warehouse management software of our strategic global warehouse collaborators.



In addition to continuing to use our third-party logistics partners like Harte Hanks, we are expanding our in-house warehouse and fulfillment capabilities, particularly in the southern United States, as a result of the Trend Brand Solutions acquisition, including its Tomball, TX-based distribution center. We are in the process of moving this operation into a new 5,500-square-foot warehouse, which we expect to open in May 2023, and where we will offer our customers specialty fulfillment, kitting, and warehousing. These in-house fulfillment capabilities are expected to give us greater control and more flexibility to meet the complex demands of our customers.

Technology



Our custom-developed e-commerce Magento Open Source platform allows our customers to manage all facets of their marketing program, linking branded merchandise, print, event assets, customer relationship management, or CRM, loyalty and incentives in a single solution. Our platform creates cost savings, increasing market efficiencies and brand consistency. With real-time accessibility to the necessary data to operate a complex demanding marketing program including hierarchy user profile groups, multi-lingual, multi-currency, multi-checkout methods and integration into many major ERP systems (SAP ERP, NetSuite ERP, Workday, etc.). Our on-demand mobile reporting dashboard capabilities allows the ability for self-service access within our systems empowering clients with raw data to make informative decisions for their program.



We have also invested in an internal commercial ERP software system, NetSuite ERP, which is expected to enhance the process of gathering and organizing the business data of our company through an integrated software suite, and is expected to be implemented in the first half of 2023. NetSuite combines accounting, order management, inventory, CRM, and presentation functionality. We believe that this ERP will reduce inefficiencies, expenses and headcount, automate current manual processes, and potentially contribute to growing net revenues.



Human Capital and Culture



We are more than an efficient distributor or supplier, and we offer our customers more than just products. We help them achieve their marketing and business goals using branded merchandise supported with technology, logistics, creative services, and account support. In order to provide all of these value-added services, we must leverage and cultivate the talent of our employees.



As an organization we encourage our team to engage with professional development opportunities. These opportunities include online courses, webinars, training sessions, and participation in various networking and professional development groups. As such we currently have a member of our team who serves on the board of directors for NEPPA (New England Promotional Products Association), a regional trade association, as well as another employee who is the current Board President of SAAGNY (Specialty Advertising Association of Greater New York), another regional trade association. Empowering our team to grow their own careers helps ensure that we are more knowledgeable, experienced, and engaged.



Pricing



As a large and growing firm with over 500 suppliers and due to our membership in Facilisgroup, Stran has the purchasing power to receive advantageous pricing, helping us with price-sensitive bids. Facilisgroup, a buying group of fewer than 1% of distributors in the industry, processed over $1.15 billion of sales in 2021. Pursuant to our Sublicense Agreement, we may access Facilisgroup’s @ease proprietary software tools for promotional products business management and analysis and a white labelled, managed, product website which we may use to sell promotional products under our brand. We may also access its “Signature Collection” website which Facilisgroup promises offers the best products and margins.



In addition to this competitive buying power, Stran has developed factory direct relationships with multiple factories in the U.S. and overseas. These direct relationships require additional vetting, longer production times, and larger production runs. However, we work to blend production from factory direct manufacturing with our other suppliers to continue to drive costs down on commodity-based items. We compete regularly with larger competitors and maintain healthy margins using this strategy for sourcing and procuring products. 



Supplier and Fulfillment Relationships



We have formed strategic relationships with fulfillment and commercial print providers in the United States in order to effectively warehouse and distribute merchandise from one or more of our warehouse facilities depending on our customer’s requirements. For over 27 years, we have developed these strategic relationships in order to offer our clients a powerful solution for their branded merchandise needs. Together, we have experience in developing custom marketing solutions for our clients and regularly kit together promotional printed items and branded product into a single package. Our expertise in product development and sourcing, technology development, and program management combined with our various collaborators’ superior warehousing, logistics, fulfillment, distribution and print services are a competitive advantage.





10







We offer a global solution for warehousing and fulfillment through a network of fulfillment providers including a nearly ten-year relationship with industry leader Harte Hanks. We buy products and certain raw materials from a supplier network of factories, both domestic and international, as needed. We also outsource certain technology services such as web hosting and data backup. We do not believe that we are dependent on any supplier. Should any of these suppliers terminate their relationship with us or fail to provide the agreed-on services, we believe that there would be sufficient alternatives to continue to meet customer demand and comply with our contractual obligations without interruption.



Marketing



We have a direct sales team consisting of over 27 outside sales representatives and 25 in-house sales representatives. We incentivize our representatives with a commission structure.



Our marketing approach combines the sales funnel concept of the marketing process with digital and in-person marketing efforts. We market to a large number of prospects at the top of the sales funnel to make them aware of our business and our products and services by combining lead-generation activities with digital marketing, including website content, SEO, paid ads, and email list promotions, and in-person activities including tradeshow and other events. We use targeted emails, social media messages, and other digital and in-person lead-nurturing activities, develop case studies, and apply other digital and in-person sales tools to market to prospects that demonstrate interest in our business. For prospects that demonstrate readiness to buy and reach the bottom of the sales funnel, we use tools such as sales presentations, sales proposals, and sell sheets.



To that end, we have built out our digital lead generation team to launch an initial program that is currently being refined to drive higher-quality leads and we are analyzing our marketing to sales handoff process to improve our close rates. Our efforts in in-person marketing include expanding the number of tradeshows and conferences that we attend and sponsor across different industry verticals. We have also planned to increase our attendance and sponsorship from two annual tradeshows in 2022 to eight tradeshows in 2023. At these tradeshows, we plan to target representatives of specific industry verticals, such as the beverage industry or the cannabis market, and a variety of professionals attending events focused in the areas of marketing or procurement development.



In addition to efforts to develop new business opportunities, our marketing team works closely with our sales team and our managers to develop opportunities from existing customer accounts. With existing customers, we are seeking to cross-sell and expand our services to encompass all employee, customer, and partner loyalty and engagement programs that are designed to reward loyalty through a combination of premium products, branded merchandise, and digital and experiential rewards.



Customers and Markets



Stran’s customer base includes approximately 2,000 active customers and over 30 Fortune 500 companies, servicing a diverse customer base, encompassing pharmaceutical and healthcare, manufacturing, technology, finance, construction and consumer goods. Our active customers are any organizations, businesses, or divisions of a parent organization which have purchased directly or indirectly from us within the last two years, and include organizations that have bought from other organizations for which Stran acts as an established subcontractor. We have long-term contracts with many of our customers, though most do not have minimum guarantees. We have ongoing contracts with clientele in such industries as financial services, consumer packaged goods, retail clothing and accessories, pet food and medicine, fitness, child care, retail hardware, fast food franchises, health care, and environmental services. Contracts are often multi-year and auto-renewing. Our average contract lifespan is approximately 10 years. Alternatively, we do have inventory guarantees where the customer must purchase any inventory held by us that has been purchased on their behalf within the contractual time periods. Our active customers may be broken into two main categories, transactional clients and program clients.



We have also been retained for some very large promotional campaigns. For example, during 2019-2020, we were engaged by a Washington, D.C.-based advertising and marketing company leading a nationwide awareness-generating initiative for the 2020 U.S. Census. With our nationwide network of collaborator vendors and suppliers, we delivered a total array of approximately 16 million products printed with various logos in 15 different languages, in all 50 states and 5 U.S. territories, all aimed at increasing public participation in the U.S. Census. This campaign generated approximately $15 million in revenues over that time period, as well as an all-time high self-response rate for the U.S. Census. During 2020, this contract represented approximately 27.1% of our overall revenues. However, we treat these revenues as nonrecurring. The customer that engaged us in this regard will not renew their engagement with us due to the U.S. Census only occurring once every ten years. As a result, these nonrecurring revenue increases have not recurred, are not expected to recur, and do not represent our long-term growth expectations.

During 2022, sales to our largest three customers were 8.8%, 7.2% and 5.9% of total revenue, respectively. All other customers generated less than 4% of sales, and the vast majority generated less than 1% of sales. During 2021, sales to our largest three customers were 7.5%, 5.4% and 5.1% of total revenue, respectively. All other customers generated less than 5% of sales, and the vast majority generated less than 1% of sales.



While our customer contracts are typically auto-renewing and we have many long-term established customer relationships, most of our customer contracts do not have any minimum or exclusive purchase guarantees, other than as to inventory already ordered by them or their program participants. There is no assurance of recurring revenues. We are not dependent on any particular customer or group of customers, and our highest-grossing contracts may change from year to year due to client brand initiatives.



We do business principally with customers based in the United States, although we also provide e-store, logistical support and other promotional services for client programs in Canada and Europe.



Online Store



We have been a leader in the use of technology to offer our clients an online platform to more efficiently manage their promotional marketing programs and to give them the ability to sell branded merchandise directly to consumers. We launched our first online store for one of our clients in 1999. Today we offer a custom-built technology platform which offers a B2C (business-to-consumer) retail shopping experience combined with all of the back-end functionality required of a powerful B2B (business-to-business) marketing services platform. Our technology platform services over 280 online stores for our clients.



Our Online Store Account Managers are responsible for ensuring that our stores are up to date with all products, images, and descriptions. As new products are approved to be added to the online store, our account manager will work the appropriate resources to prep the images, write the descriptions and upload the images. Typically, this process will take 24-48 hours. For inventoried products, we typically do not make the products live on the website until they have been received into inventory and are ready to be fulfilled.



If there is an issue with an online store order regarding payment or checkout, the user can contact the appropriate client team who will help troubleshoot the issue or manually place the order. If there is a back-order situation where an order would not be able to ship complete or on time, our Client Services team will review the order and advise the customer on the best and timeliest options to fulfill the order.



Competition



Our major competitors for our promotional products business include larger companies such as 4Imprint Group plc, Brand Addition Limited (The Pebble Group plc), BAMKO LLC (Superior Group of Companies, Inc.), Staples Promotional Products (Staples, Inc.), Boundless Network, Inc. (Zazzle Inc.), Custom Ink, Cimpress plc and HALO Branded Solutions, Inc. We also compete with a multitude of foreign, regional and local competitors that vary by market. If our existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, we may be required to lower our prices, which would adversely affect our operating results. Similarly, if customers or potential customers perceive the products or services offered by our existing or future competitors to be of higher quality than ours or part of a broader product mix, our revenues may decline, which would adversely affect our operating results.

Our Program Management



We are experienced and industry-leading program managers who integrate all aspects of a successful program. Our program team works hand in hand with our account teams to drive the processes and procedures that ensure we are effectively managing our programs. For Stran, program management is built upon six key building blocks:

● | Creative Products. We approach promotion marketing, branded merchandise, and loyalty and incentives with the structure and vision of an ad agency. We have built a robust creative and merchandising team that works collaboratively with our account teams to bring fresh ideas and identify future trends for each of our program clients. We proactively develop merchandising plans, source products, offer individual personalization, understand trends, and make continuous improvements to the product offering based on user demand and marketing goals. We also offer multiple procurement methods within the same platform. These include inventoried products, made-to-order products, and personalized products. Our approach is to utilize all three procurement methods within a single program to take advantage of the benefits each method offers. In addition to these three procurement models, Stran has developed strong factory direct relationships with factories around the globe. We utilize these relationships to help drive down costs for our clients. In order to ensure that we can bring products to market quickly and reduce the possibility of backorders, Stran uses a blended approach to sourcing. We work with our domestic supply base to bookend our overseas inventory purchases. Stran purchases and owns inventory for many clients. This benefits our customers by allowing for budget flexibility and a pay-as-you-go model, resulting in reduced upfront costs and streamlined accounting and reporting.

● | Robust Technology. We have developed our own custom technology platform based on Magento Open Source, an open-source software e-commerce platform. Using Magento we have been able to build a custom solution that meets the very distinctive needs of each of our clients. Stran is constantly making improvements and enhancements to our technology offerings. Client stores feature the ability to purchase a combination of inventoried products in addition to on-demand, and personalized products. The front-end responsive design ensures an impressive mobile experience. Our platform is user-friendly and easy to use while robust enough to offer many of the requirements needed in a traditional B2B solution. The requirements can include allocation to cost centers, departments, or general ledger codes; approval hierarchies; varied product selection or pricing by user group; and robust reporting. Our custom-built platform is also tied directly into our fulfilment center system for streamlined flow of data and we are capable to tying our platform into third party software such as Salesforce as well as accounting and procurement software. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Global Distribution. We offer a global solution for warehousing and fulfillment through a network of industry-leading fulfillment providers including a close working relationship with Harte Hanks, an industry leader in warehousing, fulfillment, print-on-demand, direct mail, and kitting. The relationship between Stran and Harte Hanks has been fine-tuned over a nearly ten-year period and allows Stran to do what we do best, which is the creativity, product procurement, technology and account management while allowing Harte Hanks to do what they do best, which is process-driven fulfillment. Through our longstanding relationship with Harte Hanks we have developed integrated account management teams which ensures that while the customer has a large and diverse account team to support all their program needs, they also have a single account director responsible for all aspects of their program. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under our agreement with Harte Hanks, as amended and supplemented, we may subcontract to Harte Hanks one or multiple functions as appropriate, such as e-store website setup; ongoing website inventory management services; monthly account management services; and print-on-demand, warehousing, fulfillment, pick/pack/ship, and other inventory management services. Costs and fees depend on types of services provided and any special or custom work that we request on behalf of our customers.



In addition to continuing to use our third-party logistics partners like Harte Hanks, we are expanding our in-house warehouse and fulfillment capabilities, particularly in the southern United States, as a result of the Trend Brand Solutions acquisition, including its Tomball, TX-based distribution center. We are in the process of moving this operation into a new 5,500-square-foot warehouse, which we expect to open in May 2023, and where we will offer our customers specialty fulfillment, kitting, and warehousing. These in-house fulfillment capabilities are expected to give us greater control and more flexibility to meet the complex demands of our customers.




● | Proactive Customer Services. Customer service is a key component of the overall success of an organization. Each account is assigned a single dedicated account director who is responsible for all aspects of the customer’s program. This account director is supported by an online store account manager, a special-order account manager, a fulfillment account manager, account coordinators, a merchandiser, art team support, operations team support, and accounting support. The customer’s account director works with program stakeholders on weekly status calls, quarterly business reviews and an annual review. We also use customer feedback surveys periodically to gain insight from the power users of the customer’ program and we have a formal corrective action process to address any issues that are not caught through our proactive efforts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compliance and Emissions Reporting. We take issues of compliance very seriously. We recognize that we are an extension of the customer’s brand, and our systems are built to ensure full compliance around brand standards, quality and safety of products and the meeting of industry/firm rules. We have also begun to implement a program to assess and manage our carbon emissions policies, standards, and goals. To that end, we are working on finalizing a contract with a third-party emissions auditor to help us identify our historical, or “baseline,” Scope 1-3 carbon emissions. Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles). Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, or cooling. Scope 3 emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly affects in its value chain. Scope 3 emissions include all sources not within an organization’s scope 1 and 2 boundary. As we are not a manufacturer ourselves, and for the most part do not control the manufacturing or decoration process, Scope 3 emissions are expected to comprise the largest share of our carbon footprint. As such, the Scope 3 emission evaluation will be the most challenging for us to quantify and to change. We believe through benchmarking and continued education, both internally and with our customers, we will be able to use the data compiled by the third-party emissions auditor to develop a longer-term mitigation strategy. Once our baseline numbers are determined, we plan to begin to report those to Ecovadis, the world’s largest and most trusted provider of business sustainability ratings, along with our future plans and policies designed to drive increased compliance across our supply chain and to reduce our impact. Ecovadis will produce a scorecard of our efforts, policies, and procedures, which we expect to become available to the public. We anticipate that by the end of the second quarter of 2023, our baseline Scope 1 and 2 emissions data will be established and to begin our evaluation of Scope 3 emissions with Ecovadis prior to completing our Scope 3 emissions audit. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integration. Offering our clients an industry-leading technology platform that stands alone only adds so much value. We have worked to ensure that our platform can be easily integrated with as many other technology platforms used by our clients as possible. This helps our clients in many different ways depending on the specific integrations. We can integrate with various CRM or marketing automation platforms to help our clients track and measure who is using the marketing assets that we provide and how they are performing. We can also integrate with a number of different accounting and procurement systems. This helps our clients better control their spend as well as account for their spend. By forming a close working relationship with worldwide logistics leader Harte Hanks as our warehouse collaborator, we offer the most robust warehousing, fulfillment, kitting, and other logistics capabilities available domestically and internationally. In addition to their multiple U.S. locations for warehousing and fulfillment, Harte Hanks is a leader in print-on-demand and direct mail. Harte Hanks completes over 3 million on-time shipments of time-sensitive materials each year. Being able to integrate print, product, packaging, kitting, and direct mail, we help our client be more impactful and efficient with their promotional marketing efforts.

Intellectual Property



We conduct our business using the registered trademark “STRÄN” and the registered trade name “Stran Promotional Solutions”. We also use the unregistered logo “STRÄN promotional solutions”.



To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions. Federal trademark law protects our registered trademark STRÄN and may protect our unregistered logo “STRÄN promotional solutions”. We also rely on the protection of laws regarding unregistered copyrights for certain content we create and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technology including our e-commerce platform and new ERP system currently under development. To further protect our intellectual property, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our executive officers and directors.



Seasonality and Cyclicality



Our business is generally not subject to seasonal fluctuations. While certain customers have seasonal businesses, the promotional products industry overall is not. Our net sales and profits sometimes are impacted by the holiday selling season.



Portions of the promotional products industry are cyclical in nature. Generally, when economic conditions are favorable, the industry tends to perform well. When the economy is weak or if there are economic disturbances that create uncertainty with corporate profits, the promotional products industry tends to experience low or negative growth.



Security



We regularly receive and store information about our customers, vendors and other third parties. We have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties or through open-source solutions may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery, or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, and vendors.
Employees



As of March 27, 2023, we employed 98 full-time employees, two part-time employees and eight independent contractors.



We do not believe any of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that we have an excellent relationship with our employees.



Regulation



Trade Regulations



As disclosed above, our suppliers generally source or manufacture finished goods in parts of the world that may be affected by the imposition of duties, tariffs or other import regulations by the United States. The Company believes that its redundant network of suppliers provide sufficient capacity to mitigate any dependency risks on a single supplier.



We buy promotional products from suppliers or factories both domestically and internationally as needed. We do not depend on any single supplier. However, if we are unable to continue to obtain our finished products from international locations or if our suppliers are unable to source raw materials, it could significantly disrupt our business. Further, we are affected by economic, political and other conditions in the United States and internationally, including those resulting in the imposition or increase of import duties, tariffs and other import regulations and widespread health emergencies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.



Laws and Regulations Relating to E-Commerce



Our business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations applicable to companies conducting business on the Internet. Jurisdictions vary as to how, or whether, existing laws governing areas such as personal privacy and data security, consumer protection or sales and other taxes, among other areas, apply to the Internet and e-commerce, and these laws are continually evolving. For example, certain applicable privacy laws and regulations require us to provide customers with our policies on sharing information with third parties, and advance notice of any changes to these policies. Related laws may govern the manner in which we store or transfer sensitive information or impose obligations on us in the event of a security breach or inadvertent disclosure of such information. Additionally, tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not currently collect state or local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit such taxes, or to additional taxes, or to requirements intended to assist jurisdictions with their tax collection efforts.

The production, distribution and sale in the United States of many of our products are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Lanham Act, state consumer protection laws, competition laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, various other federal, state and local statutes applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products, and rules and regulations adopted pursuant to these laws. Outside the United States, the distribution and sale of our many products and related operations are also subject to numerous similar and other statutes and regulations.



A California law known as Proposition 65 requires a specific warning to appear on any product containing a component listed by the state as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. Proposition 65 exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in California because it does not provide for any generally applicable quantitative threshold below which the presence of a listed substance is exempt from the warning requirement. Consequently, the detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 does not require a warning if the manufacturer of a product can demonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:




● | below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | naturally occurring;
--+---------------------


● | the result of necessary cooking; or
--+------------------------------------


● | subject to another applicable exemption.
--+-----------------------------------------




In January 2019, New York State’s governor announced the “Consumer Right to Know Act,” a proposed law that would impose similar and potentially more stringent labeling requirements than California Proposition 65. The law has not yet been adopted, and to our knowledge California Proposition 65 remains the most onerous state-level chemical exposure labeling statutory scheme. However, due in part to the large size of California’s market, promotional products sold or distributed anywhere in the United States may be subject to California Proposition 65.



We are unable to predict whether a component found in a product that we assisted a client in producing might be added to the California list in the future. Furthermore, we are also unable to predict when or whether the increasing sensitivity of detection methodology may become applicable under this law and related regulations as they currently exist, or as they may be amended.



We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to labor and employment, U.S. customs and consumer product safety, including the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (the “CPSIA”). The CPSIA created more stringent safety requirements related to lead and phthalates content in children’s products. The CPSIA regulates the future manufacture of these items and existing inventories and may cause us to incur losses if we offer for sale or sell any non-compliant items. Failure to comply with the various regulations applicable to us may result in damage to our reputation, civil and criminal liability, fines and penalties and increased cost of regulatory compliance. These current and any future laws and regulations could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas requiring deposits or certain taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of beverage container-related deposit, recycling, tax and/or product stewardship statutes and regulations also apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and overseas. We anticipate additional, similar legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere.





16







New legislation or regulation, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce generally could result in significant additional taxes on our business. Further, we could be subject to fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. The continued growth and demand for e-commerce is likely to result in more laws and regulations that impose additional compliance burdens on e-commerce companies.



Laws and Regulations Relating to Data Privacy



In the ordinary course of our business, we might collect and store in our internal and external data centers, cloud services and networks sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business collaborators, as well as personal information of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. The number and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions that companies have experienced from third parties has increased over the past few years. Despite our security measures, it is impossible for us to eliminate this risk. 



A number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information and other sensitive personal information. For example, all 50 states and several U.S. territories now have data breach laws that require timely notification to affected individuals, and at times regulators, credit reporting agencies and other bodies, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of certain personal information. Other state laws, particularly the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended (“CCPA”), among other things, contain disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about residents in their state and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to collect and/or use personal information. Moreover, on January 28, 2022, the California Attorney General announced that certain consumer loyalty programs are subject to the CCPA, which may affect some of our customers who use our loyalty program services if they are found not to comply with the CCPA’s requirements. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) also establishes rights for Virginia consumers to control how companies use individuals’ personal data. The CDPA dictates how companies must protect personal data in their possession and respond to consumers exercising their rights, as prescribed by the law, regarding such personal data. The CDPA went into effect on January 1, 2023. Effective January 1, 2023, we also became subject to the California Privacy Rights Act, which expands upon the consumer data use restrictions, penalties and enforcement provisions under the California Consumer Privacy Act. Effective July 1, 2023, we will also become subject to the Colorado Privacy Act and Connecticut’s An Act Concerning Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring, which are also comprehensive consumer privacy laws. Effective December 31, 2023, we will also become subject to the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, regarding business handling of consumers’ personal data. Meanwhile, several other states and the federal government have considered or are considering privacy laws like the CCPA. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.  



Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), also might apply to some of our operations or business collaborators. Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data/information continue to evolve. The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data/information, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world have enacted or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection.



The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement and maintain adequate compliance programs. Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.

Environmental Regulations



We use certain plastic, glass, fabric, metal and other products in our business which may be harmful if released into the environment. In view of the nature of our business, compliance with federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has had no material effect upon our operations or earnings, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the foreseeable future. However, see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Industry – Climate change and increased focus by governments, stockholders and customers on sustainability issues, including those related to climate change, may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.” and “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results.” for discussion of material related risks.



Tax Laws and Regulations



Changes in tax laws or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, including the United States, or changes in how the tax laws are interpreted, could further impact our effective tax rate, further restrict our ability to repatriate undistributed offshore earnings, or impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions on our current practices and reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.



We are also subject to tax audits in the United States and other jurisdictions and our tax positions may be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe that our current tax provisions are reasonable and appropriate, there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued, that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposures. Any increase in the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.



Other Regulations



We are subject to international, federal, national, regional, state, local and other laws and regulations affecting our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), various securities laws and regulations including but not limited to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, the Listing Rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, or Nasdaq, various labor, workplace and related laws, and environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may expose us to potential liability and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
Corporate Structure and History



Our company was incorporated in Massachusetts on November 17, 1995 under the name “Strän & Company, Inc.” We also use the registered trade name “Stran Promotional Solutions”.



On September 26, 2020, we acquired certain assets including the customer account managers and customer base of the Wildman Imprints promotional products business division of Wildman Business Group, LLC, or WBG.



On May 24, 2021, we changed our state of incorporation to the State of Nevada by merging into Stran & Company, Inc., a Nevada corporation that was incorporated on May 19, 2021, and changed the spelling of our name to “Stran & Company, Inc.” In addition, on May 24, 2021, our authorized capital stock changed from 200,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, to 350,000,000 shares, consisting of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share. At the same time, we also completed a 100,000-for-1 forward stock split of our outstanding common stock through the merger by issuing 100,000 shares of our common stock for each previously outstanding share of common stock of our predecessor Massachusetts company. As a result of this stock split, our issued and outstanding common stock increased from 100 shares to 10,000,000 shares, all of which were then held by Andrew Stranberg, our Executive Chairman, Treasurer, Secretary, and director.



Following our reincorporation in Nevada, on May 24, 2021, Mr. Stranberg was our sole stockholder then holding a total of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock. On the date of the reincorporation transaction, Mr. Stranberg transferred 3,400,000 shares of common stock to Andrew Shape, our Chief Executive Officer and President and director, and 800,000 shares of common stock to Randolph Birney, our Executive Vice President, pursuant to stock purchase agreements. The price per share was equal to $0.1985 per share, which was the calculated price of a share of common stock of the Company as of December 31, 2020 determined through a valuation of the shares of common stock of the Company dated April 27, 2021. Each of Messrs. Shape and Birney paid the purchase price for the shares to Mr. Stranberg through the delivery to Mr. Stranberg of a secured promissory note effective as of May 24, 2021. Each of the promissory notes provides for 2% simple annual interest, and principal and accrued interest must be repaid by the note’s third anniversary, May 24, 2024. Each note grants a security interest to Mr. Stranberg in the transferred shares as to the repayment obligations under the note.





18







The stock purchase agreements between Mr. Stranberg and Messrs. Shape and Birney provide that the shares are also subject to a lockup provision providing that one-half of the purchased shares may not be sold until the second anniversary of the date of the stock purchase agreement, or May 24, 2023; provided, however, that such restriction on transfer will expire at a rate of 1/48th of the shares subject to the restriction per month over such two-year period. The shares are subject to a market standoff provision restricting transfers and other dispositions of the shares as reasonably requested by the Company and its underwriter until the date that is two years after its initial public offering, which occurred on November 8, 2021 (the “IPO”). The shares were formerly subject to a repurchase right which lapsed upon the occurrence of the IPO. Subject to the above remaining restrictions, Messrs. Shape and Birney may sell the shares subject to the security interest at prevailing market prices so long as such portion of the sale proceeds as is required under the promissory note to repay the note is so used to repay the note. The foregoing description of each stock purchase agreement and promissory note described above is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such documents which are filed as Exhibit 10.9, Exhibit 10.10, Exhibit 10.11, and Exhibit 10.12 to this Annual Report, respectively, and which are incorporated herein by reference.



On May 24, 2021, Mr. Stranberg also transferred 700,000 shares of common stock to Theseus Capital Ltd. (“Theseus”), pursuant to a stock purchase agreement. Pursuant to a different arrangement with Mr. Stranberg from Mr. Shape and Mr. Birney’s, Theseus paid Mr. Stranberg a nominal cash purchase price of $100 for its stock. Theseus does not have any relationship with the Company other than as a stockholder after the transfer by Mr. Stranberg, and its payment for Mr. Stranberg’s stock was made to Mr. Stranberg and not to the Company. The stock was subject to a market standoff provision restricting transfers and other dispositions of the stock as reasonably requested by the Company and its underwriter until the date that is two years after the IPO. Theseus also executed an irrevocable proxy providing that Mr. Stranberg may vote and exercise all voting and related rights with respect to the shares. During 2021 and 2022, Theseus transferred all of the shares to others with the consent of the Company, its underwriter and Mr. Stranberg. The irrevocable proxy automatically terminated with respect to the shares upon their subsequent sale by Theseus.



On November 12, 2021, we completed the IPO, in which we sold 4,337,349 units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a publicly-traded warrant to purchase one share of common stock at the initial public offering price (the “IPO Price”) of $4.15 per unit, plus an additional 650,602 shares of common stock and 650,602 publicly-traded warrants pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. Initially, the common stock and publicly-traded warrants had been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market tier of Nasdaq under the initial ticker symbols “STRN” and “STRNW”, respectively. Subsequently, we changed the ticker symbols of the shares and publicly-traded warrants to “SWAG” and “SWAGW”, respectively. Each whole share exercisable pursuant to the publicly-traded warrants had an initial exercise price per share of $5.1875, equal to 125% of the IPO Price. Due to our subsequent private placement of common stock and common stock purchase warrants at a purchase price of $4.97 for one share and 1.25 warrants combined, after attributing a warrant value of $0.125, the exercise price per share of the publicly-traded warrants was reduced to $4.81375 as of December 10, 2021. The publicly-traded warrants were immediately exercisable and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the original issuance date. The units were not certificated. The shares of common stock and publicly-traded warrants were immediately separable and were issued separately, though they were issued and purchased together as a unit in the offering. See “Item 5. Market For Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities – Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – November 2021 Initial Public Offering” for further discussion of this transaction.



On December 10, 2021, we completed a private placement with several investors, wherein a total of 4,371,926 shares of common stock were issued at a purchase price of $4.97 per share, with each investor also receiving a warrant to purchase up to a number of shares of common stock equal to 125% of the number of shares of common stock purchased by such investor in the private placement, or a total of 5,464,903 shares, at an exercise price of $4.97 per share, for a total purchase price of approximately $21.7 million. The warrants were immediately exercisable on the date of issuance, expire five years from the date of issuance and have certain downward-pricing adjustment mechanisms, including with respect to any subsequent equity sale that is deemed a dilutive issuance, in which case the warrants were subject to a floor price of $4.80 per share before stockholder approval of the private placement was obtained, and after stockholder approval was obtained, such floor price would be reduced to $1.00 per share, as set forth in the warrants. On December 10, 2021, the holders of shares of common stock entitled to vote approximately 65.4% of our outstanding voting stock on December 10, 2021 approved the Company’s entry into the private placement. We filed preliminary and definitive information statements on Schedule 14C with the SEC on December 29, 2021 and January 11, 2022, and delivered copies of the definitive information statement to stockholders January 12, 2022. On January 31, 2022, the stockholders’ consent became effective pursuant to Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act. As a result, the exercise price of the warrants may be reduced to as low as $1.00 per share if their downward-pricing adjustment mechanisms become applicable. The warrants issued in this private placement are not registered for resale or listed on any stock exchange and are subject to restrictions on transfer. We engaged EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC (“EF Hutton”) as our placement agent for the private placement. We agreed, among other things, to issue the EF Hutton’s designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of 131,158 shares of common stock, which is equal to 3.0% of the total number of shares issued in the private placement, at an exercise price of $4.97 per share. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition – Liquidity and Capital Resources – December 2021 Private Placement” for further discussion of this transaction.
