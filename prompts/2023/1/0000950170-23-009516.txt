 Overview
Invivyd, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company on a mission to rapidly and perpetually deliver antibody-based therapies that protect vulnerable people from the devastating consequences of circulating viral threats, beginning with SARS-CoV-2. Our technology works at the intersection of evolutionary virology, predictive modeling, and antibody engineering, and is designed to identify high-quality, long-lasting antibodies with a high barrier to viral escape. We are generating a robust pipeline of product candidates which could be used in prevention or treatment of serious viral diseases, starting with COVID-19 and expanding into influenza and other high-need indications.
Our vision is to provide hope for vulnerable people from viral diseases. To enable this vision, our current discovery efforts are focused on unique mAb-based product candidates that we optimize to improve breadth, potency, half-life, where applicable, and developability. Key elements that we believe differentiate our approach include: (1) cutting edge viral and epidemiological surveillance; (2) recognition of the importance of identification and availability of a repertoire of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies; and (3) industry-leading B-cell mining, protein and antibody engineering as well as developability screening capabilities through our internal expertise and collaborations. We have leveraged our integrated discovery platform approach to produce candidate antibodies for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 and lead molecules for other infectious diseases, such as influenza. In addition, we continue to evaluate therapeutic candidates for infectious diseases with high unmet medical need through in-licensing opportunities that may leverage our team’s expertise and capabilities.
 Globally, COVID-19 has caused millions of deaths and lasting health problems in many survivors and remains a significant global health crisis. Isolation and mental health impacts, absenteeism from work, and educational losses for children have been profound consequences of this crisis. COVID-19 persists and continues to impact patients, notably those who are immune compromised, and combating this disease will require a variety of effective and safe prevention and treatment options for years to come. By leveraging the company’s capabilities, which we have developed through our experience with adintrevimab and nearly three years in the COVID-19 space, we aim to develop a continuous repertoire of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to keep pace with viral evolution.
 VYD222 is expected to be our second mAb candidate to enter clinical testing. We continue to plan for a Phase 1 clinical trial start in the first quarter of 2023. After a dose-ranging Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics (“PK”), we intend to initiate a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of VYD222 to prevent COVID-19, specifically in immune compromised individuals. VYD222 has demonstrated in vitro neutralizing activity against prior and current SARS-CoV-2 VoCs, including the Omicron sublineage XBB.1.5. VYD222 is an engineered version of adintrevimab, our investigational mAb, which demonstrated clinically meaningful results and generated a robust safety data package in global Phase 3 clinical trials for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 during the Delta and Omicron BA.1 waves of SARS-CoV-2 but subsequently lost in vitro neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.2. Utilizing our expertise in antibody engineering, we were able to restore the activity against BA.2 and other Omicron VoCs, while maintaining activity against previous VoCs. The resulting mAb, VYD222, differs from adintrevimab by only eight amino acids in the variable region.
 On December 15, 2022, a joint EMA-FDA COVID-19 workshop entitled: Efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in the context of rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants was held to discuss alternative strategies for development of novel monoclonal antibody therapies, including those based on prototype products that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in clinical trials. A group of researchers, clinicians and industry representatives discussed and endorsed the use of a surrogate marker of clinical efficacy to support these alternative development strategies. As part of the joint EMA-FDA COVID-19 workshop, neutralizing antibody titers were proposed as a possible surrogate marker of protection based on data from our adintrevimab prevention clinical trial (EVADE). It is our belief that neutralizing antibody titers, combined with associated PK and safety information, may be used for a streamlined development pathway.
Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing, building an intellectual property portfolio, business planning, conducting research and development, establishing and executing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates, and raising capital. We rely on partnerships, external consultants and contract research organizations (“CROs”) to conduct discovery, non-clinical, preclinical and clinical activities. Additionally, we rely on Contract Testing Laboratories (“CTLs”) and contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”) to execute our chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) development, testing and manufacturing activities. We have engaged WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited (“WuXi Biologics”), a CDMO, for the development and manufacture of our product candidates for clinical and commercial use. Further, in 2022, we secured dedicated laboratory space and expanded our research team in order to enable internal discovery and development of our mAb candidates, while continuing to

leverage our existing partnership with Adimab. We are focused on antibody discovery and use of Adimab’s platform technology, while building our internal capabilities. In addition, we engage third parties to perform ongoing research and development and other services on our behalf.
 We expect to continue to rely on third parties for clinical trials and the manufacture and testing of our product candidates, as well as to perform ongoing research and development and other services on our behalf.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize differentiated products that could be used for the prevention and/or treatment of viral infectious diseases beginning with COVID-19. We intend to deliver new product candidates on a perpetual, ongoing basis to provide solutions for vulnerable people as new SARS-CoV-2 VoCs emerge. In order to achieve this goal, our strategy involves execution of the following key elements:
•Obtaining regulatory authorization or approval for our lead product candidate, VYD222, for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. We continue to work with global regulators to align on an expedited and replicable pathway to SARS-CoV-2 mAb authorization or approval, with potential for authorization under an EUA or other expedited pathways. There are precedents in the influenza and COVID-19 vaccine spaces for leveraging existing safety and efficacy data to bridge quickly to new or engineered mAbs. We expect these discussions with regulators to continue as we advance the VYD222 program.
 •Successfully commercializing VYD222, if authorized or approved. We believe the commercialization of VYD222, if authorized or approved, will involve direct sales to governments, including relevant health agencies and national health systems, and in the U.S., health insurers, integrated delivery networks and large employers. We are exploring a range of commercial go-to-market approaches in the U.S. and Europe, including building our own commercial organization, outsourcing to contract sales and marketing organizations, and/or partnering with other biopharmaceutical firms with established sales, marketing, and market access capabilities. In certain markets, such as Latin America, Asia-Pacific, including China, and Middle Eastern and African countries, we intend to commercialize VYD222 through partnerships, if authorized or approved.
 •Ensuring supply of drug product for VYD222 and future clinical product candidates. We have partnered with WuXi Biologics for CMC development and for clinical and commercial drug substance and drug product supply of VYD222. We believe we have secured sufficient capacity for our initial supply needs, in the event that VYD222 is authorized under an EUA. We continue to evaluate access to worldwide capacity at both WuXi Biologics and other CDMOs to ensure we can meet potential future demand for VYD222. We expect to continue to use multiple CDMOs and laboratories as we advance non-clinical development activities related to our pipeline candidates.
 •Advancing differentiated product candidates to address infectious diseases through internal research, in-licensing and leveraging collaborations. We have built a portfolio of broadly neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as our lead disease area of focus. We have exclusive access to Adimab’s industry-leading B-cell mining, protein and antibody engineering capabilities for coronavirus and influenza antibody discovery. We are currently leveraging this partnership and building internal capabilities to further expand our portfolio with additional uniquely differentiated anti-viral antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, as well as other infectious diseases. In addition, we have employed unique protein engineering strategies to enhance activity of our current antibodies against circulating SARS‑CoV‑2 VoCs. With our cutting edge viral and epidemiological surveillance, we aim to stay ahead of potential future VoCs with our repertoire of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Finally, we continue to evaluate product candidates for infectious diseases with high unmet need through in-licensing opportunities in addition to utilizing our team’s expertise and differentiated design capabilities.
 •Leveraging our team’s collective expertise in development, manufacturing and commercialization to deliver future product candidates to patients. Since our inception, we have assembled a team with deep and specific expertise in discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing novel treatments for infectious diseases, including extensive experience with developing mAb-based therapies. Based on our team’s collective track record, including other COVID-19 product launches, we executed on the clinical, regulatory, and manufacturing plan for adintrevimab, which can be leveraged to support our next generation VYD222 program and follow-on programs. 


Background on COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 Variants
COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, gave rise to a global pandemic in 2020. SARS-CoV-2 continues to cause infections and disease. COVID-19 remains a significant global health problem. According to estimates as of March 6, 2023 from the Johns Hopkins University, there have been approximately 676 million cases of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 6.9 million COVID-19-related deaths worldwide, with approximately 104 million laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 1.1 million COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. Disease modeling conducted by several different organizations suggests that these estimates significantly underrepresent the true number of infections and deaths related to COVID-19.
Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 resulting in the rise of new variants and VoCs (see figure below) continues to pose significant issues. A VoC is a variant designated by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease, significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, or diagnostic detection failures. From early 2022, several Omicron sublineages have represented the dominant VoCs circulating globally. Several of the amino acid substitutions within the receptor binding domain (“RBD”) of the spike glycoprotein of the Omicron sublineages are associated with escape from common classes of neutralizing antibodies, thereby endowing Omicron with significantly increased resistance to serum neutralizing antibodies induced following natural infection and vaccination with ancestral strains of the virus. Importantly, all therapeutic mAbs previously authorized have had their authorizations revoked in the U.S. due to loss of activity against currently circulating VoCs. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop next-generation mAbs against current and potentially future SARS-CoV-2 VoCs.

SARS-CoV-2 Variants Continue to Emerge, Particularly Within the Omicron Sublineages

Current Approaches for Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 and Their Limitations
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple therapeutics have been discovered, developed and authorized at an unprecedented speed. Currently available vaccines demonstrate limited efficacy, particularly in the immunocompromised. Monoclonal antibody therapies represent a promising alternative to active immunization.
 mAbs for Prevention or Treatment of COVID-19
To date, no mAb has been approved for prevention (pre- or post-exposure) or treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S. The FDA issued an EUA for tixagevimab/cilgavimab for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19, in addition to EUAs for casirivimab/imdevimab and bamlanivimab/etesevimab for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in certain individuals. Four monoclonal antibody products, casirivimab/imdevimab, bamlanivimab/etesevimab, sotrovimab, and bebtelovimab, have received an EUA from the FDA for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients at high risk of disease progression. Despite this progress in the availability of mAbs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, the clinical utility of these products has varied over time due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants demonstrating partial or full resistance to neutralization and at this time none of these products are authorized for use in prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S. due to limited to no activity against the predominant circulating Omicron sublineages. For this reason, an ongoing supply of novel or engineered mAb products are needed to protect against SARS-COV-2 variants that continue to emerge over time.
 Our Approach to The Development of Antibody-based Solutions for COVID-19 and Other Viral Diseases
 Our approach is designed to perpetually deliver new product candidates that keep pace with viral evolution. Our technology works at the intersection of evolutionary virology and predictive modeling, and antibody discovery and engineering. By coupling ongoing variant surveillance and prediction of viral evolution with our discovery and engineering capabilities, our

innovation engine has generated a pipeline of therapeutic candidates which could be used in prevention or treatment of serious viral diseases, starting with SARS-CoV-2. In order to provide solutions to vulnerable people as new variants emerge, we seek to leverage evolving regulatory paradigms, which may rely on surrogate endpoints, to expedite drug development. Our company has been designed to identify and develop high-quality, long-lasting antibodies with a high barrier to viral escape on a perpetual basis. Our product candidates can be tuned to improve potency, breadth of neutralization, as well as format, including half-life extending and other fragment crystallizable (“Fc”) region modifications. Key elements that we believe differentiate our approach include:
 •Recognition of the importance of broadly neutralizing antibodies with a reduced risk of viral escape: From the outset of our COVID-19 program, we chose to identify and engineer monoclonal antibodies with a high potential to resist SARS-CoV-2 variant escape. We are targeting epitopes that are (1) conserved, non-overlapping, (2) rare and under less immune pressure, and (3) potentially conserved across other human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (“ACE-2”) using sarbecoviruses (such as SARS-CoV-2), providing anticipated neutralization breadth to our monoclonal antibody candidates. 
 •Continuous monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 variants: We continuously maintain and improve our in-house monitoring system for identifying new and upcoming SARS-CoV-2 variants before they become VoCs. Further, by pinpointing dominant spike glycoprotein sites targeted by human antibody repertoires, and mapping common mutational escape routes we aim to predict future variants.
 •Industry-leading antibody mining, engineering and developability screening capabilities through internal expertise and our partnership with Adimab: We leverage deep B-cell mining capabilities to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies, linked to utilization of antibody engineering capabilities to improve the potency, breadth, biophysical properties and developability of our candidates we advance into preclinical development. Where applicable, we specifically engineer our antibodies, for example to extend their half-lives, modify their Fc-mediated innate immune effector functions, or alternative formats such as single-domain or bispecific molecules.
 •Expedited path to the clinic and market: In order to deliver new mAb products that keep pace with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, we believe that a new, expedited approach and pathway is needed across non-clinical, clinical and CMC development to provide more rapid solutions to vulnerable people. We are leveraging and applying our experience with adintrevimab, which demonstrated clinically meaningful results and a robust safety package, to new therapeutic candidates. We seek to streamline nonclinical toxicology studies where possible, with the intention of reducing dependence on animal studies, which we believe is well in line with the FDA’s position. Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is a well validated target and mechanism of action for monoclonal antibodies with robust safety and efficacy data generated across the class. We expect that these data will enable the application of surrogate endpoints, specifically serum neutralizing antibody titers, which can be utilized as a correlate of protection in future clinical trials. We also seek to streamline our manufacturing approach, leveraging platform processes and historical data to ensure product quality for future product candidates. We will be actively engaging with regulatory authorities to seek concurrence on these proposals as we advance our product candidates. 
 
We are employing similar strategies for other antigenically variable viruses, such as influenza.

Emergency Use Authorization Environment in the U.S.
 In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, and with a declaration of a public health emergency by the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), the FDA has the authority to issue EUAs, which authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life threatening diseases or conditions. On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 under the PHS Act. On February 4, 2020, HHS determined that COVID-19 represented a public health emergency under the FDCA with significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad. Subsequently, HHS declared on March 24, 2020 that circumstances existed to justify the authorization of emergency use of certain medical products, during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any authorization as issued by the FDA. While the Biden Administration announced that it would allow the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by HHS under the PHS Act to expire on May 11, 2023, this does not impact the FDA’s ability to authorize COVID-19 drugs and biological products for emergency use. The FDA may continue to issue new EUAs going forward when criteria for issuance are met. Such ability arises from the EUA declaration and determination issued pursuant to the FDCA, which remains in effect unless or until the HHS Secretary terminates such declaration and determination, at which

point EUAs based on such declaration would cease to be in effect and the FDA may no longer issue EUAs for products covered by such declaration.
 Under an EUA, products may be available via an Advance Purchase Agreement (“APA”) or a traditional commercial model. In August 2022, HHS announced that Eli Lilly’s bebtelovimab would be transitioning from an APA model to a traditional commercial model. Since that time, there have been no new APAs signed for any COVID mAbs. As a result, we anticipate that all future COVID-19 mAbs, including VYD222, if authorized or approved, will be distributed in the traditional commercial model. In the traditional commercial model, the manufacturer sells product directly to wholesalers and/or distributors who ship the product to various sites of care, and provider institutions and clinics can bill health plans for product. It is important to note that in an EUA a manufacturer cannot make any claims about the safety and efficacy of its drug; with a full marketing authorization biologics license applicable (“BLA”), a manufacturer can make these claims as long as they are consistent with the product’s label.
 Addressable Patient Populations
 
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
 In an EUA environment, the Healthcare Provider and Patient Fact Sheets specify the patient populations eligible to receive COVID-19 treatment and prevention, and utilization of PrEP products is bound by these specifications. If we are successful with a request for EUA of VYD222 for PrEP, we estimate that the total addressable PrEP market for VYD222 in the U.S. is at least 7-8 million immunocompromised patients.
For example, the January 2023 Fact Sheet for tixagevimab/cilgavimab states, in part, that tixagevimab/cilgavimab may only be used in adults and pediatric individuals (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg):
 •Who are not currently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who have not had a known recent exposure to an individual infected with SARS-CoV-2; and
 •Who have moderate to severe immune compromise due to a medical condition or receipt of immunosuppressive medications or treatments and may not mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination; or 
 •For whom vaccination with any available COVID-19 vaccine, according to the approved or authorized schedule, is not recommended due to a history of severe adverse reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine(s) and/or COVID-19 vaccine component(s).
 According to the January 2023 Fact Sheet for tixagevimab/cilgavimab, medical conditions or treatments that may result in moderate to severe immune compromise and an inadequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination include but are not limited to:
 •Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies;
 •Hematologic malignancies associated with poor responses to COVID-19 vaccines regardless of current treatment status (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute leukemia);
 •Receipt of solid-organ transplant or an islet transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy;
 •Receipt of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy);
 •Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (e.g., common variable immunodeficiency disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome);
 •Advanced or untreated HIV infection (people with HIV and CD4 cell counts <200/mm3, history of an AIDS-defining illness without immune reconstitution, or clinical manifestations of symptomatic HIV); and
 •Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (i.e., ≥20 mg prednisone or equivalent per day when administered for ≥2 weeks), alkylating agents, antimetabolites, transplant-related immunosuppressive drugs, cancer chemotherapeutic agents classified as severely immunosuppressive, and biologic agents that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory (e.g., B-cell depleting agents).
 We have conducted several waves of market research with physicians that have reflected that there are gaps in pre-exposure prophylactic alternatives in a variety of U.S. populations. Specifically, we commissioned a consulting firm to conduct epidemiological analyses supplemented with physician interviews to quantify the size of the adult immunocompromised population in the U.S. The analysis suggested that there are potentially an additional 10-12 million adults in the U.S. with impaired immune responses attributable to conditions such as uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes and autoimmune disorders such as

severe multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and irritable bowel disease, bringing the total potential addressable immunocompromised population in the U.S. closer to 20 million patients. Extrapolated to European Union countries (whose population is approximately 1.5x that of the U.S.), there are an additional 30 million immunocompromised adults that could be candidates for PrEP therapy in the EU.
 Treatment
 In an EUA environment, the Healthcare Provider and Patient Fact Sheets specify the patient populations eligible to receive COVID-19 treatments. These Fact Sheets are largely driven by the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines published by the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), which are updated frequently.
Specifically, the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines published by NIH prioritize the following risk groups for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy based on 4 key elements: age, vaccination status, immune status, and clinical risk factors. The groups are listed by tier in descending order of priority:
Tier 1
 •Immunocompromised individuals not expected to mount an adequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their underlying conditions, regardless of vaccine status; or
 •Unvaccinated individuals at the highest risk of severe disease (anyone aged ≥75 years or anyone aged ≥65 years with additional risk factors)
 Tier 2
 •Unvaccinated individuals not included in Tier 1 who are at risk for severe disease (anyone aged ≥65 years or anyone aged <65 years with clinical risk factors)
 Tier 3
 •Vaccinated individuals at risk of severe disease (anyone aged ≥65 years or anyone aged <65 with clinical risk factors)
 In 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) estimated that 45% of the U.S. adult population, or 115 million individuals, have one or more comorbidities associated with increased risk for complications from SARS-CoV-2 infections.
 We have conducted several waves of market research with physicians that have reflected that there are gaps in COVID-19 treatment alternatives in a variety of U.S. patient populations, including:
 •Infected patients concerned about “Long COVID” who are seeking to rapidly drive down their viral load; and 
 •Infected patients for whom quarantining is not an option due to impending travel, work obligations, or other reasons.
 Pediatrics
 Although children are at lower risk of developing severe COVID-19 compared to adults, a subset of children experience poor outcomes, including severe acute disease, such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (“MIS-C”) and long-term sequelae of disease, also known as long COVID. Safe and effective therapies are needed to prevent severe disease and hospitalization in high-risk children as well as complications of COVID-19 such as MIS-C and long COVID. Similarly, although there is a paucity of data regarding the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines in children with moderate to severe immunocompromise, a subset of these children may have suboptimal immune responses to vaccines similar to adults with certain forms of immunocompromise and thus have the potential to benefit from a passive immune approach. Currently, the CDC recommends that children ages 6 months to 17 years receive their primary series vaccinations plus an updated (bivalent) booster. For immunocompromised children ages 5-17 years, the CDC recommends an additional primary series shot be administered for the Pfizer vaccine; for the Moderna vaccine, children ages 6 months to 17 should receive an additional primary series shot; and for the Novavax vaccine, no additional shots are currently required.
Pipeline Overview
 We envision additional product development opportunities emerging from our SARS-CoV-2 discovery efforts for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19. We believe the discovery of additional broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies

that target new viral epitopes both within and outside the RBD will ensure long-lasting product activity for COVID-19 as new VoCs arise as well as for future outbreaks of disease that may emerge.
 We believe that the robust antibody discovery, engineering, and development capabilities that have enabled our expedited advancement of adintrevimab may also be used to discover, engineer and develop preventative or therapeutic options for other infectious diseases, such as broadly neutralizing, half-life extended, monoclonal antibodies to provide protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza.

Manufacturing Strategy
We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities and have invested significant resources to develop commercial-scale manufacturing in partnership with our contract manufacturer partner, WuXi Biologics, with whom we have been working since our inception. We have contracted with WuXi Biologics for the manufacturing of commercial-scale VYD222. VYD222 is produced using an industry standard mAb manufacturing process including a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary (“CHO”) commercial cell line, fed-batch suspension cell culture and a chromatography column-based purification process. The drug product manufacture uses an industry standard sterile liquid drug product manufacturing process.
We have established long-term master services agreements with WuXi Biologics, pursuant to which we purchase drug substance and drug product for both clinical and commercial supply. The master services agreements are also applicable to any future clinical candidates identified for development, should we elect to use WuXi Biologics for development and supply of those candidates. We may stop placing orders under the master services agreements at any time, provided that we fulfill our obligations to make payment for, or pay cancellation-related costs related to, all committed purchases. Either party may also terminate the master services agreements with respect to an uncured breach by the other party in accordance with the terms of the agreements. The agreements include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.
We have also established a cell line license agreement with WuXi Biologics that allows for the transfer and use in drug substance manufacturing of any cell line developed by WuXi Biologics on our behalf, including those used in the manufacture of adintrevimab, VYD222 and other clinical candidate products. This license enables cell line and manufacturing process transfer to additional contract manufacturers.
 We expect to devote significant resources to the manufacture of VYD222, and we do not expect any meaningful impediments to executing our current supply plan to provide under an EUA. However, within the context of the global pandemic, sufficient capacity for commercial scale manufacturing has been constrained on a worldwide basis. We expect to have sufficient supply of VYD222 to support our clinical trial needs and to fulfill our initial supply needs upon receipt of an EUA if granted.
 Our Relationship with Adimab
Since our founding in June 2020, we have focused on the development of monoclonal antibodies for both the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Adimab is a leading provider of antibody discovery, engineering and optimization services and has established an extensive presence in the drug discovery industry.

Since July 2020, we are party to an assignment and license agreement with Adimab under which Adimab assigned to us its rights to all existing coronavirus antibodies controlled by it and their derivatives, including adintrevimab. See “—Licensing, Collaborations and Partnerships—Assignment and License Agreement with Adimab.” In May 2021, we entered into a funded discovery agreement with Adimab focused on discovery efforts for new antibodies that may be effective against other coronaviruses and influenza, both of which have the potential to cause pandemics. In the event that Adimab discovers an antibody that is expected to meet certain product profiles developed by us, we will have the exclusive option to require Adimab to assign us its rights in any such antibody and to grant us certain licenses. See “—Licensing, Collaborations and Partnerships—Collaboration Agreement with Adimab.” In addition, in September 2022, we entered into a platform transfer agreement with Adimab. Under the platform transfer agreement, we were granted the right under certain intellectual property of Adimab to practice certain elements of Adimab’s platform technology, including B-cell cloning using Adimab’s proprietary yeast cell lines and other antibody optimization libraries, trade secrets, protocols and software of Adimab, to discover, engineer and optimize antibodies. We do not have access to Adimab’s proprietary discovery libraries. We were also granted the right under certain intellectual property of Adimab to research, develop, make, sell and exploit such antibodies and products containing such antibodies. See “—Licensing, Collaborations and Partnerships—Platform Transfer Agreement with Adimab.”
Licensing, Collaborations and Partnerships
Adimab Assignment Agreement
 In July 2020, we entered into an assignment and license agreement with Adimab (the “Adimab Assignment Agreement”) with respect to discovery and optimization of coronavirus-specific antibodies, including COVID-19 and SARS. Under the Adimab Assignment Agreement, Adimab assigned to us its rights to all existing coronavirus antibodies controlled by it and their derivatives, patents claiming such antibodies, know-how related to such antibodies, and biological and chemical materials specifically related to such antibodies. Adimab also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to certain of its antibody discovery and optimization platform technology to research, develop, make, use, and sell coronavirus antibodies and products containing or comprising coronavirus antibodies, provided that we may not use such licensed rights to discover or optimize antibodies. Adimab cannot grant any third party any license or right under any patent claiming our coronavirus antibodies and cannot deliver our coronavirus antibodies to third parties; however, we have limited recourse in the event of accidental disclosures.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve specified development and regulatory milestones for products in certain major markets and to commercialize a product in any country in which we obtain marketing approval. We are obligated to pay Adimab quarterly for its services performed under the agreement at a specified full-time equivalent rate.
In July 2020, in consideration for the rights assigned and license conveyed under the Adimab Assignment Agreement, we issued 5,000,000 shares of our Series A preferred stock, then having a fair value of $40.0 million, to Adimab. In addition, under the Adimab Assignment Agreement, we are obligated to pay Adimab up to $24.6 million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for the first two products that comprise or contain coronavirus antibodies assigned to us, antibodies discovered or optimized under the Adimab Assignment Agreement, or any derivative of such antibody (the “Products”). Through December 31, 2022, we had made aggregate milestone payments of $7.5 million to Adimab under the Adimab Assignment Agreement. We are also obligated to pay Adimab royalties of a mid single-digit percentage based on annual aggregate worldwide net sales of any Products, subject to reductions for third-party licenses, biosimilar competition, compulsory licensing and a royalty floor. The royalty term expires for each Product on a country-by-country basis beginning upon the first commercial sale of each Product and ending on the later of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such Product in such country and (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim of any patent in such country that was assigned to us under the Adimab Assignment Agreement or that claims priority to any such patent. If we commercialize any Products as a diagnostic device (other than a companion diagnostic device) or as a research reagent, we must negotiate reasonable financial terms for such products.
The Adimab Assignment Agreement will expire, unless earlier terminated, on the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. We have the right to terminate the Adimab Assignment Agreement at any time upon advance written notice to Adimab. In addition, subject to certain conditions, either we or Adimab may terminate the Adimab Assignment Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and fails to cure such breach within a specified cure period after written notice is provided, except that after the initiation of the first clinical trial of a Product, Adimab may only terminate the agreement if we materially breach, and do not cure, our diligence obligation or a payment obligation. Upon expiration of the Adimab Assignment Agreement, the license becomes royalty-free, irrevocable and perpetual. Upon termination of the Adimab Assignment Agreement, all licenses and rights granted by either party will terminate and, in the case of our termination for convenience or Adimab’s termination for our material breach, we are required to assign to Adimab all right, title and interest to the patents assigned by Adimab to us or that claim priority to such patents.

Through December 31, 2022, we had made aggregate payments of $10.1 million to Adimab under the Adimab Assignment Agreement, inclusive of the milestone payments.
 Adimab Collaboration Agreement
 In May 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Adimab, as amended in November 2022 (the “Adimab Collaboration Agreement”) for the discovery and optimization of proprietary antibodies as potential therapeutic product candidates. Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, we and Adimab will collaborate on research programs for a specified number of targets selected by us within a specified time period. If Adimab is unable to generate antibodies directed against a target selected by us, then we may replace such target. Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, Adimab granted us a worldwide, non-exclusive license to certain of Adimab’s platform patents and technology and antibody patents to perform our responsibilities during the ongoing research period and for a specified evaluation period thereafter (the “Evaluation Term”). We granted Adimab a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to certain of our patents and intellectual property solely to perform Adimab’s responsibilities under the research plans. Under the agreement, we have an exclusive option on a program-by-program basis to obtain licenses and assignments to commercialize selected products containing or comprising antibodies directed against the applicable target, which option may be exercised upon the payment of a specified option fee for each program. Upon exercise of an option, Adimab will assign to us all right, title and interest in the antibodies of the optioned research program and will grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicensable license under the Adimab platform technology to research, develop, make, use, and sell the antibodies for which we have exercised our options and products containing or comprising those antibodies.
Under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, seek marketing approval for, and commercialize one product that contains an antibody discovered in each research program for which we exercise our option to obtain licenses and assignments.
Under the agreement, we are obligated to pay Adimab a quarterly fee of $1.3 million in exchange for Adimab and its affiliates agreeing not to assist in the discovery or optimization of or to direct certain third parties to discover or optimize antibodies that are intended to bind to coronaviruses or influenza viruses, which obligation may be cancelled at our option at any time. For so long as we are paying such quarterly fee (or earlier (i) if we experience a change of control after the third anniversary of the Adimab Collaboration Agreement or (ii) Adimab owns less than a specified percentage of our equity), Adimab and its affiliates will not assist or direct certain third parties to discover or optimize antibodies that are intended to bind to coronaviruses or influenza viruses with limited exception. We may also elect to decrease the scope of Adimab’s exclusivity obligations and obtain a corresponding decrease in the quarterly fee. For each agreed upon research program that is commenced, we are obligated to pay Adimab quarterly for its services performed during a given research program at a specified full-time equivalent rate; a discovery delivery fee of $0.2 million; and an optimization completion fee of $0.2 million. For each option exercised by us to commercialize a specific research program, we are obligated to pay Adimab an exercise fee of $1.0 million.
We are obligated to pay Adimab up to $18.0 million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for each product under the agreement that achieves such milestones. We are also obligated to pay Adimab royalties of a mid single-digit percentage based on annual aggregate worldwide net sales of products, subject to reductions for third-party licenses. The royalty term will expire for each product on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim of any patent claiming composition of matter or method of making or using any antibody identified or optimized under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement in such country.
In addition, we are obligated to pay Adimab for Adimab’s performance of certain validation work with respect to certain antigens acquired from a third party. In consideration for this work, we are obligated to pay Adimab royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on annual aggregate worldwide net sales of products that contain such antigens for the same royalty term as antibody-based products, but we are not obligated to make any milestone payments for such antigen products.
 The Adimab Collaboration Agreement will expire (i) if we do not exercise any option, upon the conclusion of the last Evaluation Term for the research programs, or (ii) if we exercise an option, on the expiration of the last royalty term for a product in a particular country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated. We may terminate the Adimab Collaboration Agreement at any time upon advance written notice to Adimab. In addition, subject to certain conditions, either party may terminate the Adimab Collaboration Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that is not cured within specified cure periods. Following termination, we are prohibited from (i) researching, developing, manufacturing or commercializing, any products containing antibodies discovered under the agreement, (ii) practicing, licensing, assigning, granting options to, or otherwise covenanting away rights to the foregoing products, and (iii) licensing or otherwise granting covenants not to sue third parties for the foregoing products.

Through December 31, 2022, we had made aggregate payments of $10.6 million to Adimab under the Adimab Collaboration Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, $0.3 million was due to Adimab by us.
Adimab Platform Transfer Agreement
 In September 2022 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a platform transfer agreement with Adimab (the “Adimab Platform Transfer Agreement”), under which we were granted the right under certain intellectual property of Adimab to practice certain elements of Adimab’s platform technology, including B-cell cloning using Adimab’s proprietary yeast cell lines and other antibody optimization libraries, trade secrets, protocols and software of Adimab, to discover, engineer and optimize antibodies. We do not have access to Adimab’s proprietary discovery libraries. We were also granted the right under certain intellectual property of Adimab to research, develop, make, sell and exploit such antibodies and products containing such antibodies. The Adimab platform will be transferred to us in accordance with the terms of the Adimab Platform Transfer Agreement.
We are obligated to pay Adimab an annual fee of single digit millions on each of the first four anniversaries of the Effective Date, which will allow us to receive material improvements to the platform technology, including materially improved antibody optimization libraries, updates that provide new functionality to the platform, and software upgrades, from Adimab through June 2027. The first annual fee will become due in September 2023. Beginning in July 2027 and ending in June 2042, unless terminated earlier, we have the option to receive additional material improvements to the platform technology from Adimab, subject to a commercially reasonable fee to be negotiated by the parties.
We are also obligated to pay Adimab up to $9.5 million upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones for each product under the Adimab Platform Transfer Agreement that achieves such milestones. In addition, we are obligated to pay Adimab royalties of a low single-digit percentage based on net sales of products containing an antibody discovered, engineered or optimized using Adimab’s platform technology, once commercialized. The royalty rate is subject to reductions specified under the Adimab Platform Transfer Agreement. Royalties are due on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. The royalty term will expire for each product on a country-by-country basis upon the later of (i) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country and (ii) the expiration of the last valid claim of a program antibody patent for covering the program antibody contained in such product in such country.
We may terminate the Adimab Platform Transfer Agreement at any time upon advance written notice to Adimab. In addition, subject to certain conditions, either party may terminate the Adimab Platform Transfer Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that is not cured within specified periods or in connection with the other party’s insolvency.
Through December 31, 2022, we had made aggregate payments of $3.0 million to Adimab under the Adimab Platform Transfer Agreement.
 
Population Health Partners, L.P.
 In November 2022 (the “PHP Effective Date”), we entered into a Master Services Agreement with Population Health Partners, L.P. (“PHP”), pursuant to which PHP agreed to provide services and create deliverables for us as agreed between us and PHP and set forth in one or more work orders under such agreement (the “PHP MSA”). The term of the PHP MSA commenced on the PHP Effective Date and will continue for a period of one year, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. On the PHP Effective Date, we and PHP entered into the first work order under the PHP MSA (the “PHP Work Order”), pursuant to which PHP agreed to advise and counsel us regarding clinical development and regulatory matters with respect to our product candidates. The PHP Work Order is effective for six months from the PHP Effective Date and may be extended by written agreement of us and PHP. The PHP MSA contains customary confidentiality provisions and representations and warranties of the parties, as well as mutual non-solicitation of certain employees during the term of the PHP MSA and for a period of one year thereafter. Clive Meanwell, M.D. and Tamsin Berry, members of our board of directors, are Managing Partner and Partner of PHP, respectively.
 As compensation for the services and deliverables under the PHP Work Order, we are obligated to pay PHP a cash fee of $500,000 per month during the term of the PHP Work Order for an aggregate fee of $3,000,000 (the “Aggregate Fee”). In the event that (i) we terminate the PHP Work Order for any reason other than material breach by PHP or (ii) PHP terminates the PHP Work Order due to material breach by us, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the PHP MSA, then we would be required to pay PHP the balance of the Aggregate Fee as of the date the PHP Work Order is terminated. The cash fee is subject to change if the parties extend the term of the PHP Work Order in accordance with the terms thereof.
 In addition to the cash compensation, on the PHP Effective Date, we issued a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Common Stock”), to PHP (the “PHP Warrant”). The exercise price of the PHP Warrant is $3.48 per share of Common Stock, which is equal to the Nasdaq Official Closing Price of a share of Common Stock on the trading day

immediately prior to the PHP Effective Date. The PHP Warrant is exercisable for up to an aggregate of 6,824,712 shares of Common Stock, and vests in up to three separate tranches upon certain milestones. See Note 8 to our annual consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
As of December 31, 2022, $0.8 million was due to PHP by us under the PHP Work Order.
 Research Collaboration and License Agreement with The Scripps Research Institute
 In August 2021, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement (the “Research Agreement”) with The Scripps Research Institute (“TSRI”). Under the terms of the Research Agreement, TSRI performed research activities to identify vaccine candidates for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of influenza or beta coronaviruses (the “Research Program”).
 In April 2022, we provided written notice to TSRI to terminate the Research Agreement. Following early termination in the second quarter of 2022, all licenses were terminated and reverted to TSRI.
 Through December 31, 2022, we had made aggregate payments of $4.0 million to TSRI under the Research Agreement.
Cell Line License Agreement with WuXi Biologics
 We are also party to a Cell Line License Agreement with WuXi Biologics, entered into as of December 2, 2020, as amended on February 2, 2023. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations and Commitments” and “—Manufacturing Strategy.”
License Agreement with Biocon Biologics Limited
In July 2021, we entered into a license agreement with Biocon Biologics Limited (“Biocon”) to combat the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in southern Asia. Under the license agreement, we granted Biocon exclusive rights to manufacture and commercialize an antibody treatment in India and additional select emerging markets based on the commercial process developed for adintrevimab. As part of the agreement, Biocon will be granted access to the data from our Phase 2/3 adintrevimab clinical trials and access to our EUA package, if applicable, including regulatory submissions, to support approval or emergency authorization in India and other select emerging markets.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our approach, strategy, scientific, development and manufacturing capabilities, know-how, partnerships and experience provide us with competitive advantages. However, we expect competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These entities also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patient in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
We face competition from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue the development of antibody and small molecule antivirals targeting COVID-19. Companies that have active COVID-19 antibody-based programs include AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Co, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in collaboration with Roche Pharmaceuticals, Vir Biotechnology, Inc., and Aerium Therapeutics. In addition, companies that have approved or authorized antiviral programs for the treatment of COVID-19 include Merck and Co., Inc. (oral), Pfizer Pharmaceuticals (oral), and Gilead (IV). Beyond antibody and small molecule antiviral treatments, we also face competition from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that are either available under an EUA, approved or in development for the prevention of COVID-19.
We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, better tolerated, more effective, more convenient to administer, less expensive, more resistant to viral escape, or receive a more favorable label than our product candidates. Some of our competitors have already previously obtained EUAs from the FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in high risk patients and the prevention of

COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, and others in the future may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval or authorization more rapidly than we may, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection in the U.S. and in other countries for commercially important technology, current and future inventions, improvements and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents and other intellectual property; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. Our pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a national stage patent application within 30 months in the countries in which we seek patent protection. Furthermore, our pending U.S. provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional U.S. patent application within one year of filing of the U.S. provisional patent application with the USPTO. If we do not timely file any national stage patent applications or non-provisional U.S. patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our PCT and provisional U.S. patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in such patent applications. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
We actively seek to protect our proprietary technology, inventions and other intellectual property that is commercially important to the development of our business by a variety of means, such as seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also may rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology platform, on continuing technological innovation and on in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the strength of our position in the antibody field that may be important for the development of our business. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets, as well as to manufacture and develop novel antibody products. Additional regulatory protection may also be afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
We file patent applications directed to compositions comprising our antibodies, classes of antibodies covering our product candidates, use of such antibodies for preventing and treating disease, diagnostic methods, pharmaceutical compositions, combination therapies, and methods of manufacturing. We continue to review new inventions for patent filings.
VYD222, Adintrevimab, and Other Antibodies
 As of March 16, 2023, we own one patent family for which we have three issued U.S. patents (U.S. 11,192,940, issued December 7, 2021; U.S. 11,220,536, issued January 11, 2022; and U.S. 11,414,479, issued August 16, 2022), one pending U.S. non-provisional patent application, and foreign patent applications in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, and Thailand. This patent family is directed to broadly neutralizing anti-coronavirus antibodies, including ADG20 (adintrevimab) and ADG10, and uses thereof. These patents and patent applications and any additional U.S. non-provisional patent applications or foreign patent applications timely filed based upon such applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2041, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extension.
As of March 16, 2023, we own a second patent family for which we have filed one PCT patent application. This patent family is directed to formulations and methods of use for ADG20 (adintrevimab). Any additional U.S. non-provisional patent applications or foreign patent applications timely filed based upon such application, if issued, are expected to expire in 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extension.
 As of March 16, 2023, we own a third patent family for which we have filed one PCT patent application and one foreign application in Taiwan. This patent family is directed to formulations and methods of use for ADG20 (adintrevimab). Any additional U.S. non-provisional patent applications or foreign patent applications timely filed based upon such applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extension.
 As of March 16, 2023, we own a fourth patent family for which we have filed one PCT patent application and two foreign patent applications in Argentina and Taiwan. This patent family is directed to additional broadly neutralizing anti-coronavirus

antibodies, combination therapies, and uses thereof. These patent applications and any additional U.S. non-provisional patent applications or foreign patent applications timely filed based upon such applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2042, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extension.
 As of March 16, 2023, we own two additional patent families for which we have filed provisional U.S. patent applications. The first patent family is directed to additional broadly neutralizing anti-coronavirus antibodies, combination therapies, and uses thereof, and includes four U.S. provisional patent applications. The second patent family is directed to additional broadly neutralizing anti-coronavirus antibodies, including VYD222, as well as combination therapies, and uses thereof, and includes four U.S. provisional patent applications. Any U.S. non-provisional patent applications timely filed based upon these U.S. provisional patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2043, without taking into account any possible patent term adjustment or extension.
Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
We also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology, including our proprietary scientific, business and technical information and know-how that is not or may not be patentable or that we elect not to patent. We seek to protect our proprietary information, data and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and partners. Although these agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Although we generally require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed with all third parties who may have helped to develop our intellectual property or who had access to our proprietary information, or that our agreements will not be breached. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation
In the U.S., we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. In the U.S., biologics such as our product candidates are licensed by the FDA for marketing under the PHS Act and regulated under the FDCA. Both the FDCA and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, development, manufacturing, quality control, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, marketing, sales, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biologics. FDA clearance must be obtained before clinical testing of biologics product candidates. FDA licensure also must be obtained before biologics can be marketed. Additionally, significant regulatory aspects in the European Union are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”), and the European Commission, however country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. Further, any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material negative impact on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize product candidates, and therefore on our financial performance. In addition, the laws, rules and regulations that apply to our business are subject to change and it is difficult to foresee whether, how, or when such changes may affect our business. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biologic product candidate may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to current Good Laboratory Practices (“cGLP”) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
 •preparation of clinical trial material in accordance with applicable current (“cGMP”);
 •submission to the FDA of an application for an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”), which contains, among other data and information, pre-clinical testing results and provides a basis for the FDA to conclude that there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. If the FDA does not object to the IND application within 30 days of submission, the clinical testing proposed in the IND may begin. Even after the IND has gone into effect and clinical testing has begun, the FDA may put the clinical trials on “clinical hold,” suspending (or in some cases, ending) them because of safety concerns or for other reasons;


•approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”), reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and current Good Clinical Practices (“cGCP”), which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, with the goals of assuring that the data and results are credible and accurate and that study participants’ rights, safety and well-being are protected, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information to establish the safety, purity, potency and efficacy of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use. Each clinical trial must be conducted under a protocol which details, among other things, the study objectives and parameters for monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. The protocol is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and reviewed by the agency;
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
 •satisfactory completion of a potential FDA pre-licensure inspection prior to BLA approval of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; 
 •potential FDA Advisory Committee meeting to elicit expert input on critical issues, including a vote by external committee members; and 
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA and payment of associated user fees, when applicable. 
 
Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including cGLP and the Animal Welfare Act, which are enforced by the Department of Agriculture.
 The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND before clinical testing may begin. Some nonclinical testing typically continues after the IND is submitted. An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including whether subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, requests certain changes to a protocol before the trial can begin or places the clinical trial on hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
 Clinical trials may involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to healthy volunteers or subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials involving some products for certain diseases may begin with testing in patients with the disease. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the cGCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects or their legal representative provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. IRBs are charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and consider such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee.

A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a new drug application (“NDA”) so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with cGCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and compliance with informed consent principles, and the FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an on-site inspection if deemed necessary.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biologic product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some biologic product candidates for rare diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. In addition to testing for safety, the purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, and side effect tolerability of the biologic product candidate.
 •Phase 2. The biologic product candidate is evaluated in a limited population of patients afflicted with the target disease to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the biologic product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3. The biologic product candidate is further evaluated in terms of dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population (typically from several hundred to several thousand subjects) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the biologic product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In biologics for rare diseases where patient populations are small and there is an urgent need for treatment, Phase 3 trials might not be required if an adequate risk/benefit can be demonstrated from the Phase 2 trial.
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of licensure of a BLA.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biologics, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for biologic products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
There are also various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with the research. In each of these areas, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals.
Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on its clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The product development and approval processes require substantial time and effort, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended (the “PDUFA”), each BLA may be accompanied by a significant user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most applications is subject to an application user fee. The sponsor of an approved application is also subject to an annual program fee. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. The application also needs to be published and submitted in an electronic format that can be processed through the FDA’s electronic systems. If the electronic submission is not compatible with the FDA’s systems, the BLA can be refused for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA performance goals generally provide for action on a BLA within 10 months after the 60-day filing date, or within 12 months of the BLA submission. That deadline can be extended under certain circumstances, including by the FDA’s requests for additional information. The targeted action date can also be shortened to within 6 months after the 60-day filing date, or 8 months after BLA submission, for product candidates that are granted priority review designation because they are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent and effective for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile and is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and cGCP requirements. To assure cGMP and cGCP compliance, an applicant must incur a significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control, among others.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product candidate with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or one or more additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. The applicant may also appeal the decision through the FDA’s formal dispute resolution process. Even if such additional data and information are submitted in a BLA resubmission, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data.
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4

clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require additional nonclinical testing as a Phase 4 commitment. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements if problems occur following launch, or if the FDA determines that the product is no longer safe or effective. 
Pediatric Trials
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which was signed into law on July 9, 2012, amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from non-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA, if it learns of new information, may also request that the sponsor amend the initial PSP.
 Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S.
 In emergency situations, such as a pandemic, and with a declaration of a public health emergency by the Secretary of HHS, the FDA has the authority to issue an EUA for a medical product to allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of cleared or approved medical products to be used to diagnose, treat or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear warfare threat agents when there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives.
Under this authority, the FDA may issue an EUA for a medical product if the following four statutory criteria have been met: (1) a serious or life-threatening condition exists; (2) evidence that the medical product “may be effective” to prevent, diagnose, or treat the relevant disease or condition exists; (3) a risk-benefit analysis shows that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks; and (4) no other adequate, approved, and available alternatives exist for diagnosing, preventing or treating the disease or condition. The “may be effective” standard for EUAs requires a lower level of evidence than the “effectiveness” standard that FDA uses for product clearances or approvals in non-emergency situations. The FDA assesses the potential effectiveness of a possible EUA product on a case-by-case basis using a risk-benefit analysis. In determining whether the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks, the FDA examines the totality of the scientific evidence to make an overall risk-benefit determination. Such evidence, which could arise from a variety of sources, may include (but is not limited to) results of domestic and foreign clinical trials, in vivo efficacy data from animal models, in vitro data, as well as the quality and quantity of the available evidence. Although the criteria of an EUA differ from the criteria for approval of an NDA, EUAs nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant FDA standards, and a number of ongoing compliance obligations.
 The FDA expects EUA holders to work toward submission of full applications, such as an NDA, as soon as possible. An EUA is also subject to additional conditions and restrictions and is product-specific. Once granted, an EUA will remain in effect and generally terminate on the earlier of (1) the determination by the Secretary of HHS that the public health emergency has ceased or (2) a change in the approval status of the product such that the authorized use(s) of the product are no longer unapproved. After the EUA is no longer valid, the product is no longer considered to be legally marketed and one of the FDA’s non-emergency premarket pathways would be necessary to resume or continue distribution of the subject product.
 The FDA also may revise or revoke an EUA if the circumstances justifying its issuance no longer exist, the criteria for its issuance are no longer met, or other circumstances make a revision or revocation appropriate to protect the public health or safety.
 On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 under the PHS Act. On February 4, 2020, HHS determined that COVID-19 represented a public health emergency under the FDCA that had a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad and, subsequently, declared on March 24, 2020 that circumstances existed to justify the authorization of emergency use of certain medical products, during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any authorization as issued by the FDA. The declaration of the Secretary of HHS has been further updated, and the FDA has issued numerous guidance to sponsors seeking to obtain EUAs to diagnose and treat COVID-19. The declaration of the Secretary of HHS has been further updated, and the

FDA has issued numerous guidance to sponsors seeking to obtain EUAs to diagnose and treat COVID-19. While the Biden Administration announced that it would allow the COVID-19 public health emergency declared by HHS under the PHS Act to expire on May 11, 2023, this does not impact the FDA’s ability to authorize COVID-19 drugs and biological products for emergency use. The FDA may continue to issue new EUAs going forward when criteria for issuance are met. Such ability arises from the EUA declaration and determination issued pursuant to the FDCA, which remains in effect unless or until the HHS Secretary terminates such declaration and determination, at which point EUAs based on such declaration would cease to be in effect and the FDA may no longer issue EUAs for products covered by such declaration.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. If ongoing regulatory requirements are not met, safety problems occur after a product reaches market, or additional data change the FDA’s view of the efficacy of the product, the FDA may take actions to change the conditions under which the product is marketed, such as requiring labeling modifications, restricting distribution, or even withdrawing approval. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our product candidates are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation.
Good Manufacturing Practices. Companies engaged in manufacturing drug products or their components must comply with applicable cGMP requirements, which include requirements regarding organization and training of personnel, facility registration, building and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers, closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls and records and reports. The FDA inspects equipment, facilities and manufacturing processes before approval and conducts periodic re-inspections after approval. If, after receiving approval, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process (all of which are, to some degree, incorporated in the NDA), additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements or the conditions of the product’s approval may lead the FDA to take enforcement actions, such as issuing a warning letter, or to seek sanctions, including fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, imposition of operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor FDA compliance of the third parties on which we rely for manufacturing our product candidates, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP or other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.
After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA may conduct laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of biological products. Systems need to be put in place to record and evaluate adverse events reported by healthcare providers and patients and to assess product complaints. An increase in severity or new adverse events can result in labeling changes or product recalls. Defects in manufacturing of commercial products can result in product recalls.
Sales and Marketing. We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, promotion to healthcare practitioners, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or inpatient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, state and federal fraud and abuse laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and/or state authorities may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or license revocation, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.

Other Requirements. Companies that manufacture or distribute drug products pursuant to approved NDAs must meet numerous other regulatory requirements, including adverse event reporting, submission of periodic reports, and record-keeping obligations.
 We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing data privacy and security of health information, and the collection, use and disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues that may affect our business, including recently enacted laws in all jurisdictions where we operate. Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection and privacy laws, (including, for example, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 (“FTC Act”), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”)) govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. These laws may differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space. Activities outside of the U.S. implicate local and national data protection standards, impose additional compliance requirements and generate additional risks of enforcement for non-compliance. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and other data protection, privacy and similar national, state/provincial and local laws may restrict the access, use and disclosure of patient health information abroad. Compliance efforts will likely be an increasing and substantial cost in the future.
 Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (including the imposition of significant penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties, including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, as well as their “business associates” – independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to significant penalties if we, our affiliates, or our agents knowingly receive individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
 Also at the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), sets expectations for failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure, or failing to provide a level of security commensurate to promises made to individuals about the security of their personal information (such as in a privacy notice) may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. With respect to privacy, the FTC also sets expectations for failing to honor the privacy promises made to individuals about how the company handles consumers’ personal information; such failure may also constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act. Enforcement by the FTC under the FTC Act can result in civil penalties or enforcement actions.
 Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to expedite the process for the development and FDA review of certain biological product candidates that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a biological product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.
The FDA may give a priority review designation, such as a rare pediatric disease designation, to biological products that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA’s review of an application is six months from the 60-day filing date rather than the standard goal of 10 months from the 60-day filing date under current PDUFA guidelines. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
  In addition, biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved

on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the biological product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a biological product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and the biological product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biological product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drug and biological products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decides that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “ACA”), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product via an approved BLA. Biosimilarity to an approved reference product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form and strength and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated in steps beginning with rigorous analytical studies or “fingerprinting,” in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies and generally at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of the HHS. The biosimilarity exercise tests the hypothesis that the investigational product and the reference product are the same. If at any point in the stepwise biosimilarity process a significant difference is observed, then the products are not biosimilar, and the development of a standalone BLA is necessary. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor’s U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Amendments”). The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the product development and FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period generally is one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA less any time the sponsor did not act with due diligence during the period, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application less any time the sponsor did not act with due diligence during the period. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension, only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. Moreover, a given patent may only be extended once based on a single product. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”), in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

Regulation Outside of the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies.
In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with the applicable requirements, clinical study development may proceed. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies are, to a significant extent, harmonized at the European Union level but could vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with cGCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The way clinical trials are conducted in the European Union will undergo a major change as the Clinical Trials Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 536/2014) came into application on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trial Regulation is directly applicable in all the European Union Member States, repealing the current Clinical Trials Directive (Directive 2001/20/EC). The new Clinical Trials Regulation allows sponsors to begin and conduct a clinical trial in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive during a transitional period of one year after the January 31, 2022 application date. The transition period for clinical trials ongoing at the moment of applicability will be a maximum of three years after the date of application of the Clinical Trials Regulation. Clinical trials authorized under the current Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2023 can continue to be conducted under the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. An application to transition ongoing trials from the current Clinical Trials Directive to the new Clinical Trials Regulation must be submitted and authorized in time before the end of the transitional period. The Clinical Trials Regulation harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the European Union via a Clinical Trials Information System, which will contain a centralized European Union portal and database. The main characteristics of the Clinical Trials Regulation include: (i) a streamlined application procedure through a single entry point; (ii) a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for an application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and (iii) a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”). The application used to file the BLA in the U.S. is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. In the European Union, marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized procedure, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or the national procedure of an individual European Union Member State. A marketing authorization, irrespective of its route to authorization, may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all 27 European Union Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”) established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days. This period excludes clock stops during which additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions posed by the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, such as when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest. A major public health interest defined by three cumulative criteria: (i) the seriousness of the disease (for example, heavy disabling or life-threatening diseases) to be treated; (ii) the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and (iii) the anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. If the CHMP accepts to review a medicinal product as a major public health interest, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days. It is, however, possible that the CHMP can revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
Irrespective of the related procedure, at the completion of the review period the CHMP will provide a scientific opinion concerning whether or not a marketing authorization should be granted in relation to a medicinal product. This opinion is based on a review of the quality, safety, and efficacy of the product. Within 15 days of the adoption, the EMA will forward its opinion to the European Commission for its decision. Following the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission makes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases. This

route is optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are of significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health at European Union level.
Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the authorities of each European Union Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application process is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure and must be completed within 210 days, excluding potential clock-stops, during which the applicant can respond to questions. The relevant European Union Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials. The relevant European Union Member States must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a European Union Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all European Union Member States.
The mutual recognition procedure is similarly based on the acceptance by the relevant authorities of the European Union Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the relevant authorities of other European Union Member States. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the authority of a European Union Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the authority of another European Union Member State.
Innovative products that target an unmet medical need may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs in the European Union, such as The Priority Medicines scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. Such products are generally eligible for accelerated assessment and may also benefit from different types of fast-track approvals, such as a conditional marketing authorization or a marketing authorization under exceptional circumstances granted on the basis of less comprehensive clinical data than normally required (respectively in the likelihood that the sponsor will provide such data within an agreed timeframe or when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after authorization).
The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the European Union, upon receiving marketing authorization, new active substances generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to be a new active substance, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
A Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) in the European Union is aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the authorization of a medicine for children, through studies in children. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. This requirement also applies when a marketing-authorization holder wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights. For treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the EMA reviews applications in an expedited manner for agreement of a PIP, deferrals or waivers and accelerates compliance checks, to speed up these products’ development and approval. Several rewards and incentives for the development of pediatric medicines for children are available in the European Union. Medicines authorized with the results of studies from a PIP included in the product information are eligible for an extension of their supplementary protection certificate by six months, even when the results of the studies are negative. Scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of pediatric medicines. Medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate are eligible for a pediatric-use marketing authorization, which if granted, provides 10 years of market protection.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is responsible for regulating the United Kingdom medicinal products market (Great Britain and Northern Ireland). The United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, following which existing European Union medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the United Kingdom during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. A transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained the United Kingdom’s access to the European Union single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the United Kingdom and European Union to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”) that became effective on January 1, 2021.

Among the changes that have had a direct impact are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) is now treated as a “third country,” a country that is not a member of the European Union and whose citizens do not enjoy the European Union right to free movement. As a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, different rules apply in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain. In general, Northern Ireland continues to follow the European Union regulatory regime, but its national medicines and medical devices authority remains the MHRA. Following the effectiveness of the Human Medicines (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom regulatory regime for clinical trials, marketing authorizations, importing, exporting and pharmacovigilance largely mirrors that of the European Union. As part of the TCA, the European Union and the United Kingdom will recognize cGMP inspections carried out by the other party and the acceptance of official cGMP documents issued by the other party. The TCA also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The United Kingdom has unilaterally agreed to accept European Union batch testing and batch release, and any change to this position is subject to a minimum two year notice period. However, the European Union continues to apply European Union laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the European Union territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the United Kingdom must be retested and re-released when entering the European Union market for commercial use. As it relates to marketing authorizations, Great Britain has introduced a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a separate national marketing authorization. However, Great Britain has a “European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure” which provides for an expedited authorization procedure for products that have received a positive opinion in the European Union. This centralized procedure under the MHRA aims to issue a Great Britain marketing authorization on or shortly after a European Union marketing authorization if it receives the application within 5 days of the positive opinion. The European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure is currently in place until December 31, 2023 and the MHRA has publicly stated that the procedure will be replaced by a broader international recognition procedure beyond this. Northern Ireland, however, continues to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the European Commission. Under the Windsor Framework announced by the United Kingdom government on February 27, 2023 but which is still pending formal United Kingdom and European Union approvals, future marketing authorizations granted by the European Commission would not have effect in Northern Ireland and instead Northern Ireland would be subject to the same MHRA authorization procedures as Great Britain.
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with cGCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates and the extent to which patients will be willing to pay out-of-pocket for such products in the absence of reimbursement for all or part of the cost. In the U.S. and in other countries, patients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. The availability of coverage and adequacy of reimbursement for our product candidates by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE), managed care providers, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other organizations is essential for most patients to be able to afford medical services and pharmaceutical products such as our product candidates. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a payor-by-payor basis. One payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage or adequate reimbursement. The principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency within HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent products will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Third-party payors determine which products and procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Even if a third-party payor covers a particular product or procedure, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate. Patients who are treated in-office for a medical condition generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with the procedure, including costs associated with products used during the procedure, and may be unwilling to undergo such procedures in the absence of such coverage and adequate reimbursement. Physicians may be unlikely to offer procedures for such treatment if they are not covered by insurance and may be unlikely to purchase and use our product candidates, if approved, for our stated indications unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate. In addition, for

products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs.
Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is safe, effective and medically necessary, appropriate for the specific patient, cost-effective, supported by peer-reviewed medical journals, included in clinical practice guidelines, and neither cosmetic, experimental nor investigational. Further, increasing efforts by third-party payors in the U.S. and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or comparable regulatory approvals. We may also need to provide discounts to purchasers, private health plans or government healthcare programs. Our product candidates may nonetheless not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit. There may be pricing pressures from third-party payors in connection with the potential sale of any of our product candidates. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
Foreign governments also have their own healthcare reimbursement systems, which vary significantly by country and region. Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available with respect to the treatments in which our product candidates, if approved, are used under any foreign reimbursement system. In the European Union, each European Union Member State can restrict the range of medicinal products for which its national health insurance system provides reimbursement and can control the prices of medicinal products for human use marketed on its territory. As a result, following receipt of marketing authorization in a European Union Member State, through any application route, the applicant is required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with the relevant pricing authority in the individual European Union Member State. The governments of the European Union Member States influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some European Union Member States operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other European Union Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicinal products, but monitor and control company profits. Others adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territories either on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Further, some European Union Member States approve a specific price for the medicinal product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal on the market. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, we may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some European Union Member States. These European Union Member States include France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system. Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual European Union Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product varies between European Union Member States.
In addition, pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual European Union Member States was established. The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between European Union Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some European Union Member States.
On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for an HTA Regulation intended to set out a European Union-wide framework for HTA and boost cooperation among European Union Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products. The HTA Regulation provides the basis for permanent and sustainable cooperation at the European Union level for joint clinical assessments in these areas and is therefore complementary to

Directive 2011/24/EU. The HTA Regulation was adopted on December 13, 2021, and entered into force on January 11, 2022. The HTA Regulation will apply to all European Union Member States beginning on January 12, 2025. The HTA Regulation provides that European Union Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the European Union. Individual European Union Member States will continue to be responsible for drawing conclusions on the overall value of new health technology for their healthcare system, and pricing and reimbursement decisions.
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Sales of our product candidates, if authorized or approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:
 •The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Analogous anti-kickback laws and regulations exist in the European Union;
 •Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs and biologics, that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In the European Union, the advertising and promotion of products are subject to laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”), as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the European Union. Other applicable laws at the European Union level and in the individual European Union Member States also apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products, including laws that prohibit the direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicinal products and further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and to health care professionals. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment; 
 •HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. In the European Union, there has been increased attention to privacy and data security issues that could potentially affect our business, including the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR regulates the processing of personal data and imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data from the European Union to the U.S., including health data from clinical trials. The GDPR confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR may result in fines of up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties; 


•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments, ownership interests, or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals. In the European Union, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products, which is prohibited in the European Union, is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the European Union Member States, as described below. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Certain European Union Member States, or industry codes of conduct, require that payments made to physicians be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment; and 
 •The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. businesses and their representatives from offering to pay, paying, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence any act or decision of the foreign official in his or her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage in order to obtain or retain business. Our business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act of 2010. 
 Many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and state laws that require drug and biologics manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products, if approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs and biologics. In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs and biologics administered by physicians. CMS also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs and biologics. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare laws and regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in Medicare reimbursement may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the ACA expanded manufacturers’ rebate

liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs and biologics, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of average manufacturer price (“AMP”), which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates manufacturers are required to pay to states. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the ACA. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Additional regulations governing this program have been finalized since that date. Since enactment, there have been significant efforts to modify or challenge the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commonly referred to as the individual mandate.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the ACA. For example, on August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction, which triggered the legislation’s automatic reductions. In concert with subsequent legislation, this has resulted in aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year. Sequestration is currently set at 2% and will increase to 2.25% for the first half of fiscal year 2030, to 3% for the second half of fiscal year 2030, and to 4% for the remainder of the sequestration period that lasts through the first six months of fiscal year 2031.
 Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s AMP, for single-source and innovator multiple-source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Additionally, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), which, among other things, establishes a Medicare Part B inflation rebate scheme, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the average sales price of a Part B drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. Failure to timely pay a Part B inflation rebate is subject to a civil monetary penalty. The IRA also establishes a Medicare Part D inflation rebate scheme, under which, generally speaking, manufacturers will owe rebates if the AMP of a Part D drug increases faster than the pace of inflation. The IRA also creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for Medicare units of certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition will be capped by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal AMP, starting in 2026. Failure to comply with requirements under the drug price negotiation program is subject to an excise tax and/or a civil monetary penalty. The IRA further makes several changes to the Medicare Part D benefit, including a limit on annual out-of-pocket costs, and a change in manufacturer liability under the program that could negatively affect the profitability of our product candidates. Congress continues to examine various policy proposals that may result in pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in the government health benefit programs. The IRA or other legislative change could impact the market conditions for our product candidates. Payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives as well. For example, CMS may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models.
Further legislative and regulatory changes related to the aforementioned laws remain possible. It is unknown what form any other such changes or law would take and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA or its implementing regulations, changes to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes regarding the federal government’s authority to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access or financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry and our business.
 The ACA requires pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs and biologics to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. Furthermore, the law requires manufacturers to provide a 50% discount off the negotiated price of prescriptions filled by beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, referred to as the “donut hole.” The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans by increasing from 50%to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D. The IRA subsequently replaces the Part D coverage cap discount program with a new Part D discounting program beginning in 2025.


The ACA also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The ACA expanded the 340B program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the ACA. Because the 340B ceiling price is determined based on AMP, best price, and Medicaid drug rebate data, revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula, best price, and AMP definition could cause the required 340B discounts to increase.
 There has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries, executive orders and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. At the federal level, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The implementation of this rule has been delayed until January 1, 2027.
 At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that governmental health benefit programs or commercial payors will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of February 1, 2023, we had 84 full-time employees and two part-time employees. Of our 86 full- and part-time employees, approximately 23 have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 58 are engaged in research and development activities. We have a remote workforce, with approximately 37% of our employees based in Massachusetts, 12% based in California, 9% based in Florida, 7% based in New Jersey, 5% based in North Carolina, 5% based in Pennsylvania, and the remaining 25% in various additional states. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be strong.
Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants, and ensuring we have a diverse and inclusive team. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Facilities
Since our inception, we have been a virtual company with our employees working remotely from their homes. We rent office space in an office building in Waltham, Massachusetts for general and administrative purposes. We rent laboratory and office space in a shared laboratory building in Newton, Massachusetts for research and development purposes. We believe that our remote working approach is adequate to meet our ongoing needs, and that, if we require physical facilities, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
