Company Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, including oncology, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity. Our programs are based on mechanisms of action that have achieved proof-of-concept in clinical trials in indications with large unmet needs. The most advanced product candidates in our pipeline – TERN-701, TERN-501 and TERN-601– were internally discovered. TERN-701 is our allosteric BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that is in clinical development in China for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a form of cancer that starts in bone marrow. We expect our Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to start in the second half of 2023, and intend to include sites from the United States, Europe and other countries. TERN-501 is our highly selective thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-β) agonist for NASH in Phase 2a clinical development with top-line data expected in the third quarter of 2023. TERN-601 is our small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist for metabolic diseases such as obesity. Our goal is to initiate a first-in-human clinical trial for TERN-601 in the second half of 2023. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into 2026 and be sufficient to generate at least three key clinical data readouts from our lead programs in CML, NASH and obesity. Additionally, we have an ongoing discovery effort for the TERN-800 series of small-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators for obesity, which have the potential to be combined with GLP-1 receptor agonists.
 TERN-701 is our proprietary, oral, potent, allosteric BCR-ABL TKI specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket for chronic myeloid leukemia. CML, a form of cancer that begins in the bone marrow and leads to the growth of leukemic cells, is classified as an orphan indication. The standard of care (SOC) for CML includes active-site TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. However, an unmet medical need remains due to (1) an increasing number of patients becoming refractory or intolerant to the current SOC, (2) BCR-ABL mutations that are difficult for active-site TKIs to treat (such as T315I), or (3) safety warnings for active-site TKIs used in CML patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy. Allosteric TKIs, which bind to the myristoyl-binding pocket, represent a new treatment class for CML and have the potential to address the shortcomings of active-site TKIs, including off-target activity and limited efficacy against active site resistance mutations. TERN-701 aims to address the limitations of active-site TKIs with the goal of achieving improved tumor suppression through a combination of (1) potent activity against BCR-ABL including a broad range of mutations and (2) improved safety and tolerability profiles. Survival rates and treatment durations for people living with CML continue to increase. As a result, physicians are seeking additional efficacious therapies for people whose tolerability, co-morbidity and/or drug-drug interaction profiles change over time, limiting their available treatment options, quality of life and the effectiveness of mainstay therapies. We expect our Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to start in the second half of 2023, and intend to include sites from the United States, Europe and other countries, with potential interim top-line readouts from initial cohorts in 2024. We retain all worldwide development and commercialization rights for TERN-701 outside of greater China. In July 2020, Hansoh Pharmaceuticals (Hansoh) in-licensed TERN-701 for development in the greater China region. TERN-701 is referred to by Hansoh as HS-10382. Hansoh is responsible for all development costs in the greater China region, including for the ongoing Phase 1 trial that it is conducting in China. An enrollment progress update for the ongoing China Phase 1 trial is anticipated as part of a trial-in-progress poster presentation that has been submitted to an upcoming oncology conference in mid-2023.


Our other clinical stage program is TERN-501, a THR-β agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In the single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts, TERN-501 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events (AEs) across all TERN-501 treatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and no discontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. Notably, there were no cardiac safety signals, no incidence of diarrhea and no differences between TERN-501 dose groups and placebo in change from baseline in heart rate, blood pressure or other vital signs. Based on this, we believe that TERN-501 has the potential to have a differentiated safety and tolerability profile compared to other THR-β agonists that have observed gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety findings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Significant increases in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a key pharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, were observed following treatment with TERN-501. The SHBG increases observed within 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were significant, dose dependent and have been associated with robust reductions in magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Activity Score in a precedent late-stage clinical NASH trial of another THR-β agonist. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results support the co-administration of TERN-501 and TERN-101 in NASH patients, with no apparent need for dose adjustment. We initiated the Phase 2a DUET clinical trial in NASH patients including both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-501 and TERN-101 in July 2022. Enrollment was completed in February 2023, and top-line data are expected in the third quarter of 2023. We are also engaging in activities to enable the initiation of a Phase 2b/3 program, such as drug supply manufacturing and chronic toxicology studies, and plan to initiate our Phase 2b/3 program in 2024.
We are also discovering and developing oral small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists for the treatment of obesity. Our lead molecule, TERN-601, is a potent GLP-1R agonist biased towards cAMP generation. We are conducting investigational new drug application (IND)-enabling activities for TERN-601 with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in the second half of 2023 and announcing top-line data in 2024. We expect that this Phase 1 clinical program for TERN-601 will include a single ascending dose (SAD) trial in healthy volunteers and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) proof-of-concept trial in healthy volunteers with elevated body mass index (BMI). The MAD trial is expected to assess changes in body weight and glycemic control parameters, such as HbA1c, over 28 days. Each of our GLP-1 candidate structures is believed to be suitable for oral administration as a single agent or in combination with other drug candidates, such as small molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators. In addition to TERN-601, efforts are currently underway to nominate and develop structurally distinct second-generation small molecule GLP-1R agonists.
 CML, a form of cancer that begins in the bone marrow and leads to growth of leukemic cells, is classified as an orphan indication. CML accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. In the United States, the prevalence of CML is approximately 90,000 and is expected to reach 180,000 cases by 2030. In 2023, approximately 9,000 new cases of CML are expected to be diagnosed in the United States, with an expected mortality rate of 1,300 patients. The SOC for CML includes active-site TKIs including imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib. However, an unmet medical need remains due to (1) an increasing number of patients becoming refractory or intolerant to the current SOC, (2) BCR-ABL mutations that are difficult for active-site TKIs to treat (such as T315I), or (3) safety warnings for active-site TKIs used in CML patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy. Consensus analyst estimates of 2023 sales across active-site TKIs for CML totaled approximately $5 billion.
NASH is a severe form of NAFLD that affects up to 20 million people in the United States, and up to 5% of the global population, and for which there is currently no approved therapy in the United States or Europe. In a study published in Hepatology in 2018, lifetime costs of treating and managing NASH patients in the United States in 2017 were estimated to be over $220 billion, in the absence of approved therapies. NASH is a multifaceted disease that involves three distinct pathogenic hepatic disease processes: accumulation of excess fat in the liver (steatosis), inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to these three disease processes, NASH patients often exhibit elevated levels of glucose and atherogenic lipids, are overweight or obese and accumulate excessive lipotoxic fat. Severe progression of NASH can lead to cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease and increased risk for hepatic carcinoma and liver-related mortality.

Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or greater (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and represents a leading cause of cardiometabolic diseases and mortality. Declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organization over 20 years ago, obesity has continued to rise significantly around the world. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, a third of U.S. adults 20 years of age and older are obese. Obesity has been shown to increase the risks of many diseases and conditions, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, arthritis, sleep apnea and some cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon). According to a recent study, obesity was associated with an estimated $260 billion in annual healthcare expenditures in the United States. GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have been shown to address insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, represent an emerging class of therapies used to achieve weight loss. Consensus analyst estimates forecast worldwide sales of GLP-1 therapeutics and its combinations to exceed $16 billion in 2021 and grow to over $30 billion by 2026.
 
Our Pipeline Programs
Our programs are based on mechanisms of action common to other therapies or drug candidates that have achieved proof-of-concept in clinical trials in indications with significant unmet medical needs and where we believe there is an opportunity for us to use rational drug design to meaningfully improve the efficacy, safety and tolerability of these therapies or drug candidates. Based on this premise, we are advancing multiple drug candidates we believe have the potential to deliver better clinical outcomes in a high proportion of patients in the target indication as either single-agent or combination therapies.
Pipeline Candidate for Oncology:
 •TERN-701 is our proprietary, oral, potent, allosteric BCR-ABL TKI specifically targeting the ABL myristoyl pocket for chronic myeloid leukemia. CML, a form of cancer that begins in the bone marrow and leads to the growth of leukemic cells, is classified as an orphan indication. Allosteric TKIs, which bind to the myristoyl-binding pocket, represent a new treatment class for CML and have the potential to address the shortcomings of active-site TKIs, including off-target activity and limited efficacy against active site resistance mutations. Asciminib is the only allosteric TKI that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use in third-line CML patients and is being evaluated in clinical trials for earlier lines of treatment. In a Phase 3 trial, asciminib was shown to be more than twice as effective as bosutinib, an active-site TKI, in achieving a major molecular response (MMR) in third-line CML patients after 96 weeks of treatment (37.6% asciminib v. 15.8% bosutinib; p=0.001). The discontinuation rate after 96 weeks due to the lack of efficacy or adverse events in patients on asciminib was nearly half of the rate of patients on bosutinib (31.2% asciminib v. 60.5% bosutinib). Similar to asciminib, TERN-701 aims to address the limitations of active-site TKIs with the goal of achieving improved tumor suppression through a combination of (1) potent activity against BCR-ABL including a broad range of mutations, and (2) improved safety and tolerability profiles. Survival rates and treatment durations for people living with CML continue to increase. As a result, physicians are seeking additional safe and efficacious therapies for people whose tolerability, co-morbidity and/or drug-drug interaction profiles change over time, limiting their available treatment options, quality of life and the effectiveness of mainstay therapies. We expect our Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to start in the second half of 2023, and intend to include sites from the United States, Europe and other countries, with potential interim top-line readouts from initial cohorts in 2024. An enrollment progress update for the ongoing China Phase 1 trial is anticipated as part of a trial-in-progress poster presentation that has been submitted to an upcoming oncology conference in mid-2023. 
Pipeline Candidates for Liver and Metabolic Diseases:
•TERN-501 is a THR-β agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. Agonism of THR-β increases fatty acid metabolism via mitochondrial oxidation and affects cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. As a result, THR-β stimulation has the potential to reduce hepatic steatosis, improve fibrosis and improve serum lipid parameters including LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. TERN-501 has high liver distribution and is 23-fold more selective for THR-β than for THR-α activation, thereby minimizing the risk of cardiotoxicity and other off-target effects associated with non-selective THR stimulation. Finally, TERN-501 has been designed to be metabolically stable and is therefore expected to have little pharmacokinetic variability and a low clinical dose, making it an attractive candidate for use in fixed-dose combinations for NASH treatment. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol. In the SAD and MAD cohorts, TERN-501 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across all TERN-501 treatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and no discontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. Notably, there were no cardiac safety signals, no incidence of diarrhea and no differences between TERN-501 dose groups and placebo in change from baseline in heart rate, blood pressure or other vital signs. Based on this, we believe that TERN-501 has the potential to have a differentiated safety and tolerability profile compared to other THR-β agonists that have observed gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety findings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Significant increases in SHBG, a key pharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, were observed following treatment with TERN-501. The SHBG increases observed with 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were significant, dose dependent and have been associated with robust reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAFLD Activity Score in a precedent late-stage clinical NASH trial. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results support the co-administration of TERN-501 and TERN-101 in NASH patients, with no apparent need for dose adjustment. The Phase 2a DUET trial, evaluating TERN-501 as a monotherapy and in combination with TERN-101, completed enrollment in February 2023 with top-line data expected in the third quarter of 2023. The primary endpoint is the relative change from baseline in liver fat content as measured by MRI-PDFF at Week 12 for TERN-501 monotherapy compared with placebo. Secondary endpoints include assessment of safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, changes in MRI-PDFF and MRI corrected T1 (cT1). DUET is the first trial assessing a THR-β agonist as monotherapy and in combination with an FXR agonist in people with NASH. We are also engaging in activities to enable the initiation of a Phase 2b/3 program, such as drug supply manufacturing and chronic toxicology studies, and plan to initiate our Phase 2b/3 program in 2024.
 •TERN-601 is our small-molecule Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor, or GLP-1R, agonist program that is intended to be orally administered for obesity, NASH and other metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasing in prevalence in adults, adolescents and children and is often defined by having an elevated BMI of 30 or greater. Mechanisms that contribute to increased weight include sedentary lifestyles, increased calorie intake and medications such as insulins and antipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity. GLP-1 offers multiple benefits including increased insulin secretion to the pancreas, reduced glucagon secretion in the liver, slowed gastric emptying into the gut, increased sense of satiety in the brain and reduced inflammation. Synthetic GLP-1 peptides have been approved for obesity and diabetes, which are conditions often accompanying NASH. However, approved synthetic GLP-1 peptides may require higher doses and frequent subcutaneous injections. This injectable route of administration is likely to limit their use, particularly if efficacious oral treatments become available. Our lead GLP-1R agonist, TERN-601 was designed through internal structure-based drug discovery efforts employing our proprietary three-dimensional QSAR model of the receptor, which was used to identify new GLP-1 receptor agonist candidates. The ligands were further optimized based on in vitro activity, metabolic stability, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Through this process, we discovered TERN-601, which is a potent GLP-1R agonist biased towards cAMP generation, and nominated it for development in the fourth quarter of 2021. IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 remain on track with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial for obesity in the second half of 2023 with top-line data expected in 2024. An abstract evaluating food-intake suppression in TERN-601 treated transgenic mice has been accepted for poster presentation at a major diabetes-focused scientific conference in 2023.


•TERN-101 is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid Farnesoid X Receptor, or FXR, agonist that has demonstrated a differentiated tolerability profile and improved target engagement due to its sustained FXR activation in the liver but only transient FXR activation in the intestine. FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical trials of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These safety and tolerability issues have been observed in clinical trials for other FXR agonists and have generally been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation. In June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. In the LIFT Study, TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across treatment groups. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no patient discontinued TERN-101 due to any adverse event, including pruritus. We believe TERN-101 is the first FXR agonist product candidate to show significant improvements in cT1, an imaging marker of liver inflammation and fibrosis linked to clinical outcomes, in a 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trial. In light of the positive results, our ongoing Phase 2a DUET trial includes combination arms of TERN-501 and TERN-101. We are not currently focused on the development of TERN-101 as a monotherapy. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-101 for the treatment of NASH in October 2019. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.
 
Discovery Program
 Discovery efforts are ongoing for the TERN-800 series of small molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators for obesity. In combination with GLP-1R agonists, GIPR modulators, both agonists and antagonists, have demonstrated significant weight loss in recent clinical studies. GIPR antagonism may enhance GLP-1R activity via compensatory relationships between incretin receptors. In contrast, chronic GIPR agonism may desensitize and down regulate GIPR activity, mimicking GIPR antagonism. Both GIPR agonist and antagonist approaches, when paired with GLP-1R agonism, have yielded significant levels of body weight loss (approximately 15%-20%) in late-stage trials conducted by third parties. Our discovery efforts are underway for both GIPR antagonism and agonism approaches, which we believe have the potential for combination with GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as TERN-601.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to develop and commercialize a portfolio of small-molecule product candidates to address serious diseases, including oncology, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and obesity. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:
•Develop improved drug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action. We are developing a portfolio of small-molecule drug candidates targeting clinically-validated mechanisms of action for the treatment of serious diseases including oncology, NASH and obesity. The mechanisms of action targeted by the current drug candidates in our pipeline portfolio are the same mechanisms of action targeted by other drug candidates that have achieved proof-of-concept in clinical trials. However, these clinical trials have also highlighted an opportunity for us to meaningfully improve the efficacy, safety and tolerability of therapies utilizing these mechanisms. Based on this premise, we are advancing multiple drug candidates we believe have the potential to deliver better clinical outcomes in a high proportion of patients in the target indication as either single-agent or combination therapies. 
 •Accelerate our CML development program by leveraging our collaborative partner’s ongoing Phase 1 trial in China. We have licensed development and commercial rights to TERN-701 to our collaborative partner Hansoh in the Greater China region. In May 2022, Hansoh initiated a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of TERN-701 (HS-10382) in China for CML patients. The Hansoh trial is a dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial (NCT05367700) evaluating the tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of TERN-701 (HS-10382) in approximately 100 patients with CML. We are entitled to pre-clinical and clinical data generated by Hansoh. We expect the design for our clinical trial of TERN-701 will be informed by data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial being conducted in China. We plan to continue to leverage additional clinical developments from Hansoh’s program to inform and accelerate our TERN-701 program in territories outside of the Greater China region.


•Rapidly demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept for our drug candidates by leveraging non-invasive biomarkers. We are advancing our drug candidates through clinical proof-of-concept trials on an expedited basis by using relevant non-invasive biomarkers in our clinical trials to efficiently confirm and benchmark target engagement or efficacy. For CML, we expect to measure major molecular response (MMR) through blood tests (such as polymerase chain reaction blood test) to measure clinical effect. Within NASH, we are looking to pioneer the use of non-invasive technologies (NIT) as potential novel surrogate endpoints, and are pursuing multiple avenues to achieve this outcome in collaboration with the broader NASH community. Key markers we intend to utilize include MRI-PDFF and corrected T1 (cT1) for NASH. For obesity treatment, we intend to measure body weight change. We believe this approach may enable us to accelerate enrollment in our clinical trials and achieve rapid proof-of-concept and potentially significantly shorter development timelines. 
 •Independently develop and commercialize our drug candidates in indications and geographies where we believe we can maximize the value and benefit to patients. We have a disciplined strategy to maximize the value of our pipeline by retaining development and commercialization rights to those drug candidates, indications and geographies that we believe we can ultimately commercialize successfully on our own if they are approved. We plan to collaborate on drug candidates that we believe have promising utility in disease areas, patient populations or geographies that are better served by the resources or specific expertise of other biopharmaceutical companies. We also intend to explore strategic partnerships for combination therapy approaches that may potentially yield synergistic therapeutic effects compared to monotherapy regimens alone. 
 
Background on Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
 CML is classified as an orphan indication, but is the second most common adult-onset leukemia in the United States. The prevalence of CML is approximately 90,000 and is expected to reach 180,000 cases in the United States by 2030. In 2023, approximately 9,000 new cases of CML are expected to be diagnosed in the United States, with an expected mortality rate of 1,300 patients.
 CML is a form of cancer that begins in the bone marrow and leads to growth of leukemic cells. Bone marrow is a sponge-like tissue within most bones and is responsible for producing red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Leukemia occurs when cancerous blood cells form and overcrowd healthy blood cells within the bone marrow. Leukemias may be defined as acute or chronic, which characterizes how rapidly the disease progresses without treatment. Chronic leukemias progress slowly whereas acute forms tend to progress rapidly. CML develops slowly and involves the myeloid white blood cells of the bone marrow. Over time, the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells, causing excess cells to accumulate in the blood and/or bone marrow. This type of leukemia is a fatal cancer and is caused by an error during the natural cell division process. One type of error is known as translocation, which takes place when one segment of a chromosome separates and attaches to another chromosome. The result of this translocation is known as a fusion gene, an abnormal gene formed when two different genes become fused together. CML is caused by the spontaneous chromosomal translocation of chromosomes 9 and 22. The breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22 fuses with the proto-oncogene ABL1 kinase on chromosome 9, creating the BCR-ABL1 fusion oncogene. The result is chromosome 9 being longer than normal and chromosome 22 being shorter than normal. The abnormal chromosome 22 is known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome.
In the chronic phase, leukemic cell proliferation is highly dependent on constitutively active BCR-ABL kinase activity that drives unregulated division of leukemic cells. CML cells crowd out the bone marrow’s heathy red blood, white blood and platelet cells and can cause weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath, fever, bone pain and weight loss, amongst other symptoms. Left untreated, CML can progress to become a potentially fatal disease. CML accounts for approximately 15% of newly diagnosed cases of leukemia in adults. The average age of diagnosis is approximately 64 years old, with approximately 50% of CML patients diagnosed at greater than 65 years old. CML is rarely seen in children.
 

Treatment of CML
 CML treatment was transformed by the development and approval of active-site tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The first approved TKI for CML, imatinib, was approved in 2001. Approvals of additional active-site TKIs include dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib in 2006, 2007 and 2012, respectively. Each of these active-site TKIs are approved for newly diagnosed or refractory / intolerant patient populations. Ponatinib, which is approved for use in adult patients with the T315I mutation, also gained approval in 2012. Usage of these active-site TKIs have transformed CML from a fatal disease to a chronic condition, where patients may live for decades following diagnosis.
A novel class of TKIs, known as allosteric TKIs, target the myristoyl-binding pocket, locking BCR-ABL1 into the inactive state. Allosteric TKIs are highly selective to the ABL1 myristoyl-binding pocket, and virtually inactive against other cellular kinases, avoiding the off-target effects of the active-site TKIs. Furthermore, mutations in the active-site pocket (such as T315I) may occur frequently, which may ultimately render active-site TKIs ineffective against CML. Allosteric TKIs are largely unaffected by many active-site resistance mutations. The first approved allosteric TKI, asciminib, was approved in 2021 and has demonstrated significantly improved clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability compared to an active-site TKI over 96 weeks. TERN-701 represents the potential second allosteric BCR-ABL poised for U.S. development for CML.
 
TERN-701 – an allosteric BCR-ABL TKI for CML
 
Drug Candidate Summary
 TERN-701 is an internally discovered, small molecule, allosteric BCR-ABL TKI being developed for the treatment of CML. TERN-701 aims to address the limitations of active-site TKIs with the goal of achieving improved tumor suppression through a combination of (1) potent activity against BCR-ABL including a broad range of mutations, and (2) improved safety and tolerability profiles. TERN-701 was designed to achieve similar potency against native BCR-ABL and common mutations as asciminib. In non-clinical ABL assays, TERN-701 was observed to have a similar BCR-ABL inhibition profile to asciminib. TERN-701 potency against wild type BCR-ABL was greater than asciminib, and comparable to asciminib in other mutations occurring in pre-treated patients (such as T315I). The figure below illustrates in vitro inhibition potency (IC50) of TERN-701 (solid blue line) is comparable to asciminib (dotted grey line) across wild type, active-site mutations and myristoyl-site mutations:



In July 2020, Hansoh in-licensed TERN-701 for development in the greater China region. TERN-701 is referred to by Hansoh as HS-10382. In May 2022, Hansoh initiated an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion, first-in-human study in chronic or accelerated phase CML patients, who are resistant or intolerant to prior active-site BCR-ABL TKI treatment. Hansoh is responsible for all development costs in the greater China region, including the ongoing Phase 1 trial in China. We expect our Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to start in the second half of 2023, and intend to include sites from the United States, Europe and other countries, with potential interim top-line readouts from initial cohorts in 2024.

BCR-ABL TKIs for CML
Imatinib represents the first approved active-site TKI, and transformed CML into a disease that can be survived with chronic therapy. Imatinib is approved for newly diagnosed adults and children with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML in chronic phase and patients in chronic, accelerated or blast phase with Ph+ CML, after failure of interferon-alfa therapy. However, approximately half of patients treated with imatinib develop resistance or intolerance and may be progress onto alternative active-site TKIs. Dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib are approved for newly diagnosed adults with Ph+ CML in chronic phase and adults in chronic, accelerated or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. Ponatinib is approved for adult patients with chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast phase CML for whom no other TKI is indicated and adults with the T315I mutation. These active-site TKIs offer increased potency over imatinib but worse adverse event profiles and reduced tolerability. Due to resistance or side effect intolerance, approximately 30% to 40% of patients treated with these agents are switched to an alternative TKI therapy. Despite the largely overlapping efficacy and safety profiles of the active-site TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib and bosutinib), these three TKIs cumulatively generated approximately $5 billion in 2022 sales, despite the availability of generic imatinib.
Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is another form of cancer that originates in the bone marrow, where an excess of immature lymphocytes (white blood cells) are produced. Approximately 25% of adults with ALL have a subtype known as Ph+ ALL. The leukemia cells of Ph+ ALL feature a similar translocation of parts of chromosomes 9 and 22 as observed with Ph+ CML, which creates the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL. This gene produces proteins known as tyrosine kinases leading to unregulated division of leukemic/lymphocytic cells. Over time, these cells can infiltrate the blood stream, raising the number of immature white blood cells that do not protect against infection, while crowding out healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. While Ph+ ALL has the potential to be treated by allosteric BCR-ABL TKIs such as TERN-701, due to innovation-limiting price controls for orphan drugs approved for more than one indication that was introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), we do not plan to pursue regulatory approval of TERN-701 for Ph+ ALL in the United States, but may pursue approval in countries outside of the United States.
 
Clinical validation of BCR-ABL TKIs
 CML treatment response is measured through periodic assessments of blood and bone marrow tests. The three types of treatment response are molecular, hematologic and cytogenic response.
 Molecular response (MR) is a decrease in the number of cells in the blood with the BCR-ABL gene. A quantitative PCR test is used to measure the number of blood cells containing the BCR-ABL gene and is quantified as a percentage. The initial molecular response to therapy is a significant predictor of outcomes. As a result, MR is the most sensitive method of monitoring BCR-ABL transcripts and is the most relevant in determining further treatment options. Early molecular response (EMR) is achieved when the BCR-ABL1 level is 10% or less at 3 and 6 months after the start of treatment. In EMR, leukemia cells have been reduced by 90% or more. Major molecular response (MMR) is achieved when the BCR-ABL1 level has decreased to 0.1%, signaling that leukemia cells have been reduced by 99.9% or more. A deep molecular response (DMR) is achieved when the BCR-ABL1 level has decreased to 0.01% or less. When BCR-ABL1 levels can no longer be detected, the patient has achieved Complete Molecular Response (CMR).

Hematologic response can be categorized as either partial or complete, depending on the results of a complete blood count (CBC) test. This assessment measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in the blood. A partial hematologic response is achieved when the number of each blood cell type begins to revert to normal levels. A complete hematologic response is achieved when blood cell counts return to normal and may be observed within one month of treatment initiation. Cytogenic response is assessed by measuring the percentage of cells in the bone marrow containing the Philadelphia chromosome (for example, Ph+ cells). Cytogenic evaluations of bone marrow cells are conducted at three-month intervals to assess a patient’s response to treatment. A minor cytogenic response is achieved when the Philadelphia chromosome is present in more than 35% of bone marrow cells. A major cytogenic response is achieved when 35% or fewer cells have the Philadelphia chromosome. When no cells with the Philadelphia chromosome are detected in the bone marrow, a complete cytogenic response (CCyR) is achieved.
 In pre-treated third-line patients, asciminib achieved an MMR in 25% of patients by 6 months, which was superior to and approximately two-fold greater bosutinib’s MMR rate of 13%, which was adequate to gain accelerated approval in the third-line setting. When asciminib’s Phase 3 study progressed to 96 weeks, asciminib achieved MMR in 38% of pretreated third-line patients, more than doubling bosutinib’s 16% MMR response rate, resulting in a full approval in the third-line setting. The discontinuation rate after 96 weeks due to the lack of efficacy or adverse events in patients on asciminib was nearly half of the rate of patients on bosutinib (31.2% asciminib v. 60.5% bosutinib).
Allosteric BCR-ABL inhibitors may have clinical benefit as initial CML treatment in addition to third line treatment. Novartis is conducting an ongoing Phase 3 study, ASC4FIRST (NCT04971226), of asciminib against investigator-selected TKIs in newly diagnosed (front-line) CML patients, with data expected in 2024. At the 12-month timepoint in front-line patient populations, active-site TKIs nilotinib, bosutinib and dasatinib achieved MMRs in 44%, 47% and 52% of patients, respectively, compared to imatinib’s MMR response rate of 22%-37%.
 
Limitations of active-site BCR-ABL TKIs
 Unmet medical needs in CML remain due to (1) an increasing number of patients becoming refractory or intolerant to the current SOC, (2) safety warnings for active-site TKIs used in CML patients who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy, or (3) BCR-ABL mutations that are difficult for active-site TKIs to treat (e.g., T315I).
 People with CML can expect to live life-spans nearly as long as healthy adults, and CML treatment is life-long for a high proportion of patients. As a result, treatment is selected and modified throughout the often decades long treatment period to address the course of individual patients’ CML disease over time as well as patients’ individual needs as they age. A recent publication estimated that approximately 30% to 40% of people started on any TKI switch to an alternative TKI. Physicians guide treatment decisions on molecular response to treatment as well as other individual patient needs including drug tolerability, co-morbidity and drug-drug interaction profiles, which may evolve over time. For example, nilotinib-treated patients may be switched to imatinib and bosutinib which are preferred treatment options for patients experiencing cardiovascular or peripheral artery comorbidities, while nilotinib is less preferred. In contrast, nilotinib and dasatinib may be selected as replacement therapies for patients experiencing gastrointestinal or renal comorbidities in whom imatinib and bosutinib are less recommended. Survival rates and treatment durations for people living with CML continue to increase. As a result, physicians are seeking additional novel therapies that are safe, efficacious and well tolerated to address their patients’ changing needs over time.
In later lines of CML treatment, patients may experience greater challenges with intolerance. For patients who have failed two or more TKIs, up to 55% were intolerant to a previous TKI. Even low-grade, chronic TKI intolerance can impact a patient’s compliance with therapy, which in turn can lead to poorer outcomes. In a survey of people with CML, nearly half of responders skipped doses of their medication. In a study of 87 patients with chronic phase CML, 94% of patients who were more than 90% compliant with their treatment regimen achieved MMR, whereas just 14% of patients who were less than 90% compliant achieved MMR.
 During treatment with agents that inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity, leukemic cells may also develop resistance mutations, which can block the binding of active-site TKIs and render them ineffective. Approximately 15% to 20% of patients develop BCR-ABL mutations or molecular abnormalities. T315I represents one variation of active-site mutation that renders most active-site TKIs ineffective. Ponatinib is the only active-site TKI approved for the treatment of patients with the T315I mutation but carries black box warning for cardiovascular and other toxicity. Potential resistance in second- and third-line treatment can result in poorer efficacy outcomes and increased risk of discontinuation.

Mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain may also affect the ability of the majority of active-site TKIs to bind and inhibit BCR-ABL. Recent studies suggest that inhibiting BCR-ABL with an allosteric TKI may induce a conformational change in BCR-ABL that increases the binding affinity of active-site TKIs, such as ponatinib. As a result, co-administering allosteric and active-site TKIs may lead to a synergistic effect of stabilizing the inactive conformation of BCR-ABL.
 Allosteric TKIs, which bind to the myristoyl-binding pocket, represent a new treatment class for CML and have the potential to address the shortcomings of active-site TKIs, including off-target activity and limited efficacy against active site resistance mutations. Asciminib, the first approved allosteric TKI, is also indicated for the treatment of CML in patients with the T315I mutation although at five times higher than the daily total dose used to treat patients without T315I. High dose asciminib is associated with safety and tolerability issues that may lead to lower adherence in CML patients with T315I.
 
Our solution for allosteric BCR-ABL TKIs
 TERN-701 aims to address the limitations of active-site TKIs with the goal of achieving improved tumor suppression through a combination of (1) potent activity against BCR-ABL including a broad range of mutations, and (2) improved safety and tolerability profiles. TERN-701 was designed with a target product profile to perform at least as well as asciminib. In non-clinical assays, TERN-701 demonstrated a similar profile to asciminib and is highly potent against wild type BCR-ABL and the most-common mutations occurring in patients treated with active-site TKIs. Based on results from preclinical pharmacokinetic and CYP inhibition studies we conducted, we believe that TERN-701 could also have simplified dosing and fewer drug-drug interactions compared to asciminib. We believe TERN-701 represents a potentially compelling treatment option as the second allosteric TKI under development in the United States.
In addition to use as a monotherapy, allosteric BCR-ABL TKIs such as TERN-701 may be combined with active-site TKIs to treat CML. In vitro non-clinical studies have shown the potential for synergistic effects when allosteric TKIs are used in combination with active-site TKIs. When an active-site TKI, such as ponatinib and potentially other active site TKIs, are given in combination with an allosteric TKI, the dual TKI binding approach appears to help stabilize the BCR-ABL fusion oncoprotein in its inactive conformation, leading to potentially improved efficacy.


Clinical development of TERN-701
 In May 2022, Hansoh initiated an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and expansion, first-in-human study of TERN-701 (HS-10382) in chronic or accelerated phase CML patients, who are resistant or intolerant to prior active-site BCR-ABL TKI treatment. The trial is comprised of two parts, with dose escalation being conducted in Part 1 to determine the maximum tolerated or maximum applicable dose followed by dose expansion in Part 2 of the trial, in which additional CML patients will be enrolled to receive one or more doses selected from Part 1. Part 2 of the trial will evaluate major cytogenetic response at six months as its primary endpoint, with key secondary endpoints including molecular response, hematologic response, measures of pharmacokinetics (PK) and an evaluation of safety and tolerability. The Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 in China, which is conducted and funded by Hansoh, is illustrated below:
 


We expect our Phase 1 trial for TERN-701 to start in the second half of 2023, and intend to include sites from the United States, Europe and other countries, with potential interim top-line readouts from initial cohorts in 2024. We expect the design for our clinical trial of TERN-701 will be informed by data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial being conducted in China. We plan to continue to leverage additional clinical developments from Hansoh’s program to inform and accelerate our TERN-701 program in the U.S. and our other territories.

Background on NASH
NASH is a severe form of NAFLD, a common liver disease characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the liver (steatosis). When hepatic steatosis results in liver inflammation and, in many cases, fibrosis, it results in NASH, a multifaceted disease that involves three distinct pathogenic hepatic disease processes: steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to these three disease processes, many NASH patients exhibit broader concomitant metabolic issues such as insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity and excess lipotoxic fat. Severe progression of NASH leads to cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease, with the associated risks for hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death. NASH was recently identified as the second leading etiologic indication for liver transplantation in the United States, and it is projected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation in the coming years.

NAFLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, affecting 80 to 100 million individuals. Among persons with NAFLD, approximately 20% will progress to NASH, which is currently estimated to affect 20 million adults in the United States. Progression of liver fibrosis ultimately leads to cirrhosis in an estimated 20% of patients with NASH. With an aging population and the markedly increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia/metabolic syndrome worldwide, NAFLD and NASH have increased greatly in prevalence, posing a significant healthcare challenge. Currently, no drug has been approved for the treatment of NASH in the United States or Europe. In a study published in Hepatology in 2018, lifetime costs of treating and managing NASH patients in the United States in 2017 were estimated to be over $220 billion, in the absence of approved therapies.

Etiology of NASH
NAFLD and NASH are classified as progressive metabolic diseases, often correlated with chronic excess caloric intake, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Physiologically, hepatocytes in the liver can act as a repository for excess energy stored by the body. As humans consume disproportionate amounts of calories relative to those burned on a consistent basis, the body becomes overweight, and organs, including the liver, become burdened by fatty tissue. With the liver acting as the hub for excess energy and energy conversion, an imbalance develops with more delivery of fats and triglycerides to the liver, an increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis and impaired hepatic fatty acid oxidation and removal of liver fat, resulting in NAFLD.
Inflammatory cascades in the liver activate hepatic stellate cells to excrete extracellular matrix resulting in liver fibrosis. Over time, fibrosis progresses, increasingly replacing diseased and normal liver tissue with scar tissue. Eventually, most of the liver is replaced by fibrotic tissue, which histologically is categorized as cirrhosis. While some cirrhotic patients have enough functional liver tissue to maintain hepatic activity, over time, the liver fails, resulting in decompensated liver disease and the need for liver transplantation to avoid liver related death. Furthermore, cirrhosis is a key risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma.
NASH is currently diagnosed by histological findings on liver biopsy. In clinical trials, recommended scoring systems assess (i) liver fibrosis and (ii) steatosis and inflammation using the NAFLD Activity Score, or NAS, a composite score that grades the degree of three non-fibrotic histologic features of NASH: steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and lobular inflammation. Efficacious responses to treatment in NASH clinical trials are usually considered to be either an improvement in fibrosis score without worsening of the NAS, or an improvement of the NAS without worsening of fibrosis.
While the definitive diagnosis of NASH remains linked to histology, non-invasive blood and imaging tests are increasingly being used in clinical practice to diagnose NASH, assess the likelihood of significant fibrosis, predict risk of disease progression and assess response to treatment. MRI-derived biomarkers proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and iron-corrected T1 mapping (cT1) are gaining traction as emerging alternatives to biopsy for NASH. cT1 measures free-water content in liver tissue, which has shown a strong correlation with inflammation and fibrosis histology. An estimated difference of 88 milliseconds in cT1 relaxation time has been related to a two-point difference in overall NAS. While MRI-PDFF and cT1 both correlate with NAS, only cT1 correlates with fibrosis. Further, liver cT1 has been shown to predict clinical outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease. Liver disease patients with an elevated cT1 relaxation time of 990 milliseconds or greater have been shown to have a high probability of developing a serious clinical event in the next five years, whereas those with liver cT1 relaxation times of less than 840 milliseconds have been shown to be unlikely to develop such outcomes. As data from these non-invasive assessments continue to accumulate—for initial diagnosis of NASH, monitoring of disease progression over time, and monitoring response to treatment—these approaches may replace liver biopsy, both in clinical practice and clinical trials. In its December 2018 draft NASH guidance, the FDA encouraged sponsors to include non-invasive biomarkers in clinical studies of experimental NASH treatments in order to accelerate development and supplant liver biopsy. At The Liver Meeting in November 2021, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) issued practice guidelines recommending blood and imaging-based non-invasive assessments to determine fibrosis staging prior to considering a liver biopsy. To accelerate the usage of NITs as surrogate endpoints for NASH, we joined the steering committee of the NAIL-NIT Consortium, a multi-stakeholder effort to link non-invasive testing directly to outcomes. NAIL-NIT’s preliminary planned activities include a prospective six-year study of NASH patients and, separately, a retrospective analysis of NASH patient cases to establish the best utilization of the growing array of non-invasive testing methods in the treatment, diagnosis and monitoring of NASH patients.


Treatment of NASH
There currently are no FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of NASH, and available treatment options are limited to control of metabolic dysfunction, including weight loss, as well as lifestyle modifications such as exercise and dietary changes. However, many patients are unable to achieve or maintain significant weight loss or comply long-term with the dietary and lifestyle changes required to reverse NASH. In order to optimally treat NASH and reduce the risk of liver cancer and liver-related mortality, the three distinct disease processes may each need to be addressed–steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. In addition to these three disease processes, we believe an ideal NASH therapy will also aim to improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients such as improvements in glycemic control, atherogenic lipid improvement, weight loss and/or reduction of lipotoxic fat. Single agents focusing on specific mechanisms contributing to one of these three processes, each involving multiple pathways, have demonstrated only modest results to date. As such, combination therapies, such as our THR-b agonist in combination with our FXR agonist, have the potential to better address the multitude of desired properties for the treatment of NASH.
 
Our Clinical Stage Programs in NASH
 We are developing a portfolio of small-molecules that address the multiple hepatic disease processes of NASH in order to drive meaningful clinical benefits. Our most advanced clinical stage program is TERN-501, a THR-β agonist with high metabolic stability, enhanced liver distribution and greater selectivity for THR-β compared to other THR-β agonists in development. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, cholesterol. We also have TERN-101, a liver-distributed, non-bile acid FXR agonist that has demonstrated sustained liver FXR activation, as well as a favorable tolerability profile across multiple clinical trials. We announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT clinical trial of TERN-101 in NASH in June 2021. Our Phase 2a DUET trial, evaluating TERN-501 as a monotherapy and in combination with TERN-101, completed enrollment in February 2023, with top-line data expected in the third quarter of 2023. We believe developing combination therapies that target multiple mechanistic pathways and improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients will drive improved outcomes for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns associated with other drugs in development.

TERN-501 – a selective THR-β agonist with enhanced metabolic stability and liver distribution

Drug candidate summary
TERN-501 is a selective THR-β agonist with enhanced metabolic stability and liver distribution, characteristics that are intended to improve safety and efficacy in NASH patients. THR-β is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in the liver and regulates key aspects of energy metabolism, including fatty acid and lipid synthesis and removal of liver fat through induction of fatty acid oxidation. THR-β stimulation has been identified as a target for NASH on the basis of its potential to reduce hepatic steatosis, improve fibrosis and improve serum lipid parameters in NASH patients. For any THR agonist, a key concern is toxicity from excess systemic THR-α stimulation. TERN-501 is 23-fold more selective for THR-β than for THR-α activation, thereby minimizing the risk of cardiotoxicity through THR-α stimulation. TERN-501 has high metabolic stability and a low projected clinical dose, which we believe makes it an attractive candidate for fixed-dose combination co-formulations. In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-501 for the treatment of NASH in June 2021. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.
 
THR-β agonists for NASH
Thyroid hormone plays a central role in regulating metabolism, through its actions in multiple tissues, including fat, skeletal muscle, pancreas and liver. THR-α and THR-β are nuclear receptors widely expressed in the body, but the two different isoforms are differentially expressed in different tissue types. THR-β is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in the liver and regulates key aspects of energy metabolism, including fatty acid and lipid synthesis and removal of liver fat through induction of fatty acid oxidation. THR-α is the major form of thyroid hormone receptor in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and bone. Selective agonism of THR-β in the liver has been identified as a target for NASH and validated in clinical trials on the basis of its potential to improve hepatic steatosis, liver fibrosis and lipid profiles in NASH patients.


Clinical validation of THR-β agonism
Data from other NASH clinical studies validate the potential of THR-β agonism as a NASH treatment (the data from other NASH clinical studies described in this paragraph are from Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials of resmetirom (MGL-3196). In December 2022, Madrigal announced positive Phase 3 top-line results, in which resmetirom achieved significant improvements on two histological endpoints that are currently believed to be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit: (1) NASH resolution with a two-point or greater NAS reduction with no worsening of fibrosis and (2) fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of NAS. In a Phase 2 clinical trial, resmetirom showed significant reductions in liver fat measured by MRI-PDFF, as well as reduction in lipid levels in serum, which may offer additional benefits to NASH patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular comorbidities. In this same clinical trial, resmetirom showed increases in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a key pharmacodynamic marker of THR-β engagement, which is correlated with significant reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAS reduction. These types of histological responses may be suitable for accelerated approval under current draft guidance from the FDA titled “Noncirrhotic Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis With Liver Fibrosis: Developing Drugs for Treatment Guidance for Industry.”

THR-β regulates key aspects of energy metabolism (e.g., fatty acid & lipid synthesis, liver fat removal through fatty acid oxidation)
 


Limitations of THR-β targeting
For THR agonists, a key safety concern is the potential for adverse effects from off-target thyroid hormone receptor stimulation that may stem from either lack of selectivity for THR-β or high variations in pharmacokinetics due to the lack of metabolic stability. Selectivity for THR-β over THR-α is key to modulating the metabolic activities in the liver without triggering the unwanted effects of THR-α activation outside of the liver. Stimulation of THR-α can adversely affect the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system through increases in heart rate, cardiac arrhythmias, muscle wasting and reduced bone mineral density. Therefore, the identification of a selective THR-β agonist particularly with enhanced liver distribution, would have the potential to improve hepatic steatosis, improve fibrosis and serum lipid profiles while potentially avoiding adverse effects of THR-α activation. However, the use of a liver-targeted pro-drug approach to overcome THR selectivity has not completely avoided cardiac adverse events in clinical trials.
In addition to THR-β selectivity, metabolic stability and predictable pharmacokinetics are important considerations in the development of thyroid hormone activators. In a Phase 2 clinical trial of another selective THR-β agonist, lack of metabolic stability resulted in significant inter-patient variability in drug exposure that required PK monitoring and dose adjustments. Dose adjustments in widespread clinical practice present potential challenges in terms of patient compliance, safety monitoring and additional burden on the healthcare system. Additionally, highly variable pharmacokinetics and unpredictable drug concentrations would hinder the potential for combination treatment in NASH patients.

Metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) represents a complex and meaningful component of drug metabolism. CYP metabolism is the origin of many drug-drug interactions either due to inhibition, induction or competition for enzymatic paths which are commonly used by different drugs, potentially leading to unpredictable drug effects. Other THR-β agonists in late-stage development are known to be metabolized by CYP P450.
In prior trials of THR-β agonists, cardiovascular, central thyroid and/or gastrointestinal adverse events have been observed over 12-weeks or less of treatment. Gastrointestinal adverse events included diarrhea (33%) and nausea (14%) in the active arms of the Phase 2 study of resmetirom. In another Phase 2 study of VK2809, cardiovascular events included ventricular run, chest pressure, palpitations and supraventricular tachycardia, amongst others. In a Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study of ALG-055009, mean values of Total/Free T4 and Total T3 were outside the normal range for the 1mg dose. The observed adverse events and abnormal laboratory results represent additional opportunities to improve upon the safety and tolerability profiles that are lacking with other THR-β agonists.

Our solution for THR-β agonism: high THR-β-selectivity and improved metabolic stability
TERN-501 was selected over other discovery candidates because of its high selectivity for THR-β over THR-α, its improved metabolic stability and its enhanced liver-distribution, all of which are characteristics that are intended to improve efficacy and safety in NASH patients. TERN-501 has a similar structural backbone to other THR-β agonists in late-stage development that are selective for THR-β. Furthermore, the TERN-501 chemical structure incorporates certain changes designed to enhance metabolic and pharmacokinetic stability, thereby limiting the need for individualized dose adjustments implemented in studies with other THR-β agonists. In a head-to-head comparison, TERN-501 has shown a 23-fold selectivity for THR-β over THR-α stimulation in a cell-free assay, which is higher than the selectivity for two other THR agonists currently in development. TERN-501 is not a pro-drug and does not rely on a metabolic process to make it pharmacologically active. The following chart illustrates the selectivity of TERN-501 as compared to a reference drug and the active metabolite of a pro-drug in clinical development for NASH.

TERN-501 demonstrates higher selectivity for THR-β over THR-α
 



Non-clinical tissue distribution studies show that TERN-501 demonstrates enhanced liver distribution relative to plasma and other organs. From non-clinical studies, TERN-501 is projected to have a predictable human PK profile due to its improved metabolic stability. Due to its metabolic stability, we believe that TERN-501 is unlikely to require PK monitoring and individualized clinical dose adjustment in NASH patients, as was done in a certain clinical trial of another THR-β agonist in development that lacks metabolic stability and has variable PK in humans. As a result, TERN-501 may not have the potential challenges associated with monitoring and dose adjustment in clinical practice, including patient compliance, safety monitoring and additional burden on the healthcare system. Further, TERN-501 is projected to have a low clinically efficacious dose range which, along with its metabolic stability and lack of metabolism by CYP, makes it attractive for long-term NASH treatment and for co-formulation as part of a fixed-dose combination.

Clinical development of TERN-501
In November 2021, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 in healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol.
 The Phase 1 clinical trial of TERN-501 included SAD, MAD and drug-drug interaction, or DDI, cohorts evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of TERN-501. Healthy volunteers with mildly elevated LDL cholesterol were randomized to placebo (n=2) or TERN-501 (n=6) in each cohort. Volunteers randomized to TERN-501 received single doses of 3, 10, 30 or 60 mg of TERN-501 in the SAD portion of the study or multiple doses of 1, 3, 6 or 10 mg of TERN-501 once daily for 14 days in the MAD portion of the study. In the DDI portion of the study, volunteers received open label TERN-501 co-administered with TERN-101, our liver-distributed FXR agonist also in development for the treatment of NASH.
 In the SAD and MAD cohorts, single and multiple doses of TERN-501 were generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of AEs across all TERN-501 treatment groups and placebo. All AEs were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship, with no treatment-emergent serious AEs and no discontinuations of study or study drug due to any AE. There were no cardiac safety signals, no incidence of diarrhea and no differences between TERN-501 groups and placebo in change from baseline in heart rate, blood pressure or other vital signs. Thyroid function test results were consistent with THR-β agonists currently in clinical development, and there were no findings of clinical hyper- or hypo-thyroidism. There were no differences between placebo and any TERN-501 dose group in liver function abnormalities or mean change from baseline in liver transaminases at Day 15 in the MAD cohorts.
TERN-501 demonstrated a predictable pharmacokinetic profile with low variability: study drug plasma exposures were linear and approximately dose-proportional with no overlap between dose strengths. There was no significant accumulation of drug over 14 days of dosing. TERN-501 plasma half-life was greater than 13 hours in all single and repeat dose cohorts, supporting once-daily dosing. The overall PK profile indicates TERN-501 is well-suited for co-formulation with other small-molecule NASH agents as an oral, once-daily fixed dose combination.
 Significant effects on sex hormone binding globulin, or SHBG, a key PD marker of THR-β engagement linked to NASH histologic efficacy, were observed following treatment with TERN-501. As further described in the table below, SHBG increases observed with 14 days of TERN-501 treatment were significant, dose dependent and have been associated with robust reductions in MRI-PDFF and NAFLD Activity Score in a precedent late-stage clinical NASH trial of another THR-β agonist.
 In addition, significant reductions were observed in atherogenic lipids including LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, or Apo-B, comparable to or greater than those observed in Phase 1 studies of other THR-β agonists being studied in late-stage clinical trials. All TERN-501 dose groups demonstrated significant decreases in LDL cholesterol compared to placebo during the dosing period. The maximum mean LDL cholesterol decreases over the treatment period were -13%, -22%, -28% and -27% for 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg doses, respectively, compared to placebo (-8%).


The PD results from these MAD cohorts are summarized below:
 

 | TERN-501 MAD (QD)Mean % Change from Baseline to Day 15
 | Placebo (N=8) | 1 mg(N=6) | 3 mg (N=6) | 6 mg (N=6) | 10 mg (N=6)
Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (%) | -6% | 17% | 57%* | 135%* | 165%* 
Low Density Lipoprotein – cholesterol (%) | -4% | -16% | -17% | -19% | -20%* 
Triglycerides (%) | -13% | -18% | -21% | -20% | -36%* 
Apolipoprotein-B (%) | -5% | -14% | -18%* | -23%* | -27%* 

 Note: Day 15 represents 24 hours following the last dose of TERN-501
 * p-value vs. placebo: <0.05
 In the SAD cohorts, single doses of TERN-501 up to 60 mg resulted in significant and dose-dependent reductions in Apo-B and LDL cholesterol and significant increases in SHBG relative to placebo. In the DDI cohort, the combination of TERN-101 and TERN-501 was well-tolerated. Preliminary PK results support the co-administration of TERN-101 and TERN-501 in NASH patients, with no apparent need for dose adjustment.
 
TERN-101 – a liver-distributed FXR agonist

Drug candidate summary
TERN-101 is a liver-distributed, non-bile acid FXR agonist that has demonstrated a differentiated tolerability profile and improved target engagement; likely due to its sustained FXR activation in the liver but only transient FXR activation in the intestine. FXR is a nuclear receptor primarily expressed in the liver, intestine and kidneys. FXR regulates hepatic expression of various genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical studies of other FXR agonists have demonstrated significant histological NASH improvements but have also resulted in pruritus and adverse lipid changes. These tolerability issues have generally been observed in Phase 1 clinical trials as well as later phase studies of other FXR agonists in development and have been regarded as dose-limiting toxicities, which are suboptimal for patients and can lead to treatment discontinuation.
In June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. In the LIFT Study, TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events, or AEs, across treatment groups. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no patient discontinued TERN-101 due to any adverse event including pruritus. Multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were also evaluated, including changes in liver fibro-inflammation measured by MRI corrected T1, or cT1, liver fat content by MRI proton density fat fraction, or MRI-PDFF, pharmacodynamic parameters, and serum NASH biomarkers. We received Fast Track designation from the FDA for TERN-101 for the treatment of NASH in October 2019. Fast Track designation does not guarantee an accelerated review by the FDA.

Our Solution: TERN-101, a liver-distributed FXR agonist
 In June 2021, we announced positive top-line data from our Phase 2a LIFT Study of TERN-101 in NASH patients. Based on these positive results, we plan to initiate a Phase 2a clinical trial of TERN-101 co-administered with our thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist TERN-501 in the first half of 2022 with top-line data expected in the second half of 2023.
 The LIFT Study is a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 100 patients with phenotypic or biopsy-diagnosed NASH, identified either by prior biopsy or clinical diagnosis (liver stiffness measured by transient elastography of 7.6—25 kPa and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) > 300). Clinical trial participants received once-daily oral administration of placebo or TERN-101 tablet doses of 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was the incidence of adverse events. Multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were also evaluated including changes in liver fibro-inflammation measured by cT1, liver fat content by MRI-PDFF, pharmacodynamic parameters, and serum NASH biomarkers.


TERN-101 Phase 2a LIFT trial design
 
   TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with a similar incidence of adverse events across treatment groups. All treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate with no apparent dose relationship. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events, and no patient discontinued TERN-101 due to any adverse event, including pruritus.

(1)COVID-19 pneumonia
 (2)Urinary tract infection
 All pruritus-related AEs were mild or moderate. The patient incidence of pruritus was generally balanced across TERN-101 treatment groups. Most pruritus AEs were mild and resolved during continued TERN-101 treatment.
 
* CTCAE: common terminology criteria for adverse events
 In the Phase 1 study in healthy subjects, administration of TERN-101 resulted in sustained C4 suppression but only transient effects on FGF19 induction, possibly reflecting higher levels of FXR target engagement in the liver compared to intestine. Data from the Phase 2a LIFT Study were consistent with the prior study and showed statistically significant suppression of trough C4 levels in the 10 mg and 15 mg groups but only transient increases in FGF19.


No change in LDL cholesterol was observed in patients in the 5 mg and 10 mg TERN-101 arms as compared to placebo. Statistically significant LDL changes were observed only in the 15 mg arm. Significant decreases in HDL cholesterol were observed in all TERN-101 dose groups at Week 4 and Week 8 but returned toward baseline in the 5 mg and 10 mg dose groups without differences from placebo at Week 12. Decreases in HDL were significantly different from placebo for the 15 mg group at all observed timepoints through Week 12:
 
Multiple efficacy biomarkers of NASH, including cT1 and MRI-PDFF, were evaluated in the LIFT Study. Mean changes in cT1 at Week 12 were -0.8 msec for placebo, -38.0 msec (p=0.033) for the 5 mg arm, -57.7 msec (p=0.002) for the 10 mg arm, and -74.0 msec (p<0.001) for the 15 mg arm. Improvements of at least 80 msec in cT1 were observed in a significant proportion of patients in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups at Week 12 as compared to placebo. Significant decreases in cT1 were also observed at Week 6 for all dose groups. cT1 is a magnetic resonance-based imaging test measuring free-water content in liver tissue, which has shown a strong correlation with inflammation and fibrosis histology and clinical outcomes in patients with liver disease. Mean relative changes in MRI-PDFF were -8.4% (placebo), -15.1% (5 mg), -19.7% (10 mg) and -12.9% (15 mg) at Week 12. Mean relative changes in MRI-PDFF were significant at Week 6 for the 10 mg and 15 mg dose groups compared to placebo, although these changes were not statistically significant at Week 12. MRI-PDFF is an imaging marker that measures liver fat content. No discernable trends were observed in initial analyses of the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) score, CK-18 and Pro-C3.
 Prior to the LIFT Study, we evaluated TERN-101 across four completed Phase 1 clinical trials in 136 subjects, including 119 subjects in whom TERN-101 was administered. In the Phase 1 trials, TERN-101 was generally well-tolerated with no confirmed dose-related tolerability signals. AEs tended to be mild to moderate, with no dose-related increases in AEs. In all four Phase 1 clinical trials of TERN-101, none of the 119 subjects who received TERN-101 reported pruritus, and the serum lipid profiles among TERN-101 recipients were similar to placebo recipients even at high doses.
 

NASH Combination Therapy Programs
Several prior clinical trials evaluating single-agent therapies for NASH have shown only moderate histological improvements and exhibited tolerability issues with some of these agents at high doses. We believe developing combination therapies that target multiple mechanistic pathways and improve the overall metabolic profile of NASH patients will drive improved outcomes for NASH patients while mitigating potential tolerability concerns and improving compliance as compared with monotherapy regimens. We are focused on developing combination therapies with clinically-validated mechanisms of action to address the multifaceted nature of NASH, while improving the overall metabolic profile of patients. We believe that therapies targeting steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in tandem, have the potential to provide greater resolution of NASH and improvement in related clinical outcomes. In April 2022, an IND application was cleared to support the Phase 2a DUET clinical trial of TERN-501 in combination with TERN-101, as well as future studies of other combination therapy regimens in NASH.

Preclinical data for combination therapies
We believe that a combination of TERN-501 and TERN-101 has the potential for improved therapeutic benefit for NASH patients. TERN-501 is a THR-β agonist that is expected to potently and rapidly reduce hepatic steatosis and normalize plasma lipid parameters through the modulation of metabolic pathways that are distinct from those modulated by liver FXR activation. As a liver-distributed FXR agonist, TERN-101 is expected to have effects on multiple facets of NASH, including potential improvements in steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis. A combination of TERN-501 and TERN-101 would therefore be expected to significantly reduce steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in NASH patients through their complementary effects without the need to use maximal dose levels of either agent. The combination may also result in a positive serum lipid profile since TERN-501 is expected to reduce LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels in NASH patients where FXR agonists have generally not demonstrated potentially therapeutic decreases in plasma cholesterol or triglycerides.
As seen in the charts below, the combination of the THR-β agonist TERN-501 and the FXR agonist TERN-101 showed robust efficacy in an in vivo mouse model of NASH by profoundly reducing steatosis and significantly improving fibrosis, serum triglycerides, serum total cholesterol and ALT. The combination treatment of TERN-501 and TERN-101 also resulted in the expression of more than 800 additional distinct genes as compared to either agent alone, supporting our hypothesis that additional biological processes are activated by combination treatment. Together these results suggest that the combination of the THR-β agonist TERN-501 and the FXR agonist TERN-101 may provide additional benefits for NASH patients than either treatment alone.

Data for individual animals (dots) and mean (dashed line) are presented; **p <0.01, ***p <0.001, ****p <0.


Clinical development for NASH combination of TERN-501 and TERN-101
In April 2022, the FDA cleared our IND application for our clinical-stage combination therapy candidates in NASH, including combinations of TERN-501 and TERN-101 as well as future studies of other potential combination therapy regimens. Under the IND, we are proceeding with a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial in noncirrhotic NASH patients using a factorial design, which includes both monotherapy and combination arms of TERN-501 and TERN-101. This Phase 2a trial, known as the DUET trial, was expected to enroll approximately 140 adult patients with elevated body mass index (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) and NASH with fibrosis, but not cirrhosis, based on prior liver biopsy and/or imaging criteria and clinical criteria. All enrolled patients must have liver fat content measured by MRI-PDFF of ≥10%, MRI corrected T1 (cT1) relaxation time of ≥ 800 msec, and meet other inclusion and exclusion criteria. The clinical trial includes a 12-week treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period. The primary endpoint will be the relative change from baseline in MRI-PDFF at Week 12 for TERN-501 monotherapy compared with placebo. Secondary endpoints include assessment of changes in PDFF (combination vs. placebo) and cT1 (TERN-501 monotherapy vs. placebo as well as TERN-501 and TERN-101 combination vs. placebo). Patient enrollment in the DUET trial was completed in February 2023; the total number of patients enrolled exceeded 160. Top-line data are expected in the third quarter of 2023. The Phase 2a DUET trial design is illustrated in the figure below:
 
We then plan to proceed to longer duration Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials that can evaluate our individual monotherapies as well as promising combinations within the same trials to confirm treatment effects using surrogate endpoints. We believe this approach maximizes the chance of achieving higher NASH response rates compared to treatment approaches that rely exclusively on single-agent therapeutics and creates efficiencies through the evaluation of our individual monotherapies and combination treatments, allowing us to proceed to marketing authorization applications for those single-agent drug candidates and combination therapies that offer the clearest advantages to patients.
 
Background on Obesity
 Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasing in prevalence in adults, adolescents and children and is defined as a body mass index of 30 or greater (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Mechanisms that contribute to obesity include sedentary lifestyles, increased calorie intake and medications such as insulins and antipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity.
Obesity is major health epidemic that has been declared a disease by the American Medical Association and affects populations worldwide. The Obesity Action Coalition (OAC) estimates that nearly 93 million Americans struggle with obesity, and it is predicted to increase to 120 million Americans within the next five years. In addition, the U.S. Center for Disease Control, or CDC, estimates that 42 percent of adults over the age of 20 years old are obese.


According to the OAC, there are over 40 medical conditions associated with obesity. The most prevalent obesity-related diseases include heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, gallbladder disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, some forms of cancer, sleep apnea or respiratory problems and a variety of other conditions. According to the Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy, the aggregate medical cost due to obesity among adults in the United States was $260.0 billion in 2016. A prior study examining the future health care costs attributable to obesity projected these annual expenditures to double every decade to approximately $780 billion by 2030, representing 14% of total United States health care costs. As a result, public and private stakeholders worldwide are taking steps to address obesity.
 Despite the rising obesity rate, increased public awareness of the obesity epidemic and significant pharmacoeconomic costs associated with obesity, there remains an unmet need for safe and effective pharmacological interventions. While nearly half of Americans meet the criteria for medical obesity pharmacotherapy, only 2% of adults receive medications for weight loss. Barriers to adequately prescribing weight loss medications may include inadequate prescriber training regarding use of such medications, misconceptions that excess body weight is due to lack of willpower, or that obesity is not a disease that should be treated with medications and surgery, even when indicated. We believe that the obesity epidemic continues to be a significant cause of morbidity, mortality and rising health care costs in the United States and represents an underserved therapeutic category for obesity patients.
 
Treatment for Obesity
 Treatments for obesity include lifestyle modification (diet and exercise), pharmaceutical therapies, surgery and device implantation. Modifications to diet and exercise are currently the preferred initial treatment for obesity. However, demands of sustained lifestyle modification for long periods of time tends to lead to attrition, often resulting in regained weight. When lifestyle modification alone has failed, pharmacotherapies are generally recommended.
The global pharmaceutical market for obesity was approximately $1 billion in 2020. With the recent launch of semaglutide for the treatment of obesity in 2021, the obesity market is expected to grow beyond $5 billion by 2025. Longer term estimates forecast the worldwide obesity market to exceed $27 billion by 2031, with the anticipated launches of tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor dual agonist and other novel injectable compounds. Several older approved agents, including amphetamine-like compounds such as naltrexone-bupropion and phentermine-topiramate, are indicated for short-term administration and not expected to contribute significantly to the obesity market.
 
TERN-601 – a pre-clinical oral GLP-1 for obesity and NASH
 
Drug Candidate Summary
 TERN-601 is an oral, small-molecule glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist. Internal discovery of TERN-601 was driven by computational interaction mapping, chemical synthesis and in vitro characterization of approximately 100 GLP-1R agonist compounds. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we nominated TERN-601 as our GLP-1R agonist development candidate for obesity and NASH. IND-enabling activities for TERN-601 remain ongoing, with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in second half of 2023.

GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity and NASH
GLP-1R agonists are intended to address metabolic processes involved in the pathogenesis of obesity, NAFLD, NASH and other metabolic indications. Mechanisms that contribute to increased weight include sedentary lifestyles, increased calorie intake and medications such as insulins and antipsychotics. Insulin resistance, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, also plays a key role in obesity. The natural endogenous ligand GLP-1 promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in a glucose-dependent-manner following food ingestion. GLP-1 has also been shown to reduce glucagon secretion in the liver, slow gastric emptying in the gut, create a sense of satiety in the brain, reduce inflammation and improve cardiac function. As a result, synthetic GLP-1 peptides have been approved for obesity and diabetes, which are conditions often accompanying NASH.
 

Clinical validation of GLP-1 receptor agonists
 The recently approved once-weekly injection of semaglutide for chronic weight management demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 15% at 68 weeks when used with a reduced calorie meal plan and increased physical activity. Study participants also experienced improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. Semaglutide also had positive effects on LDL and total cholesterol levels, although benefits were limited primarily to triglyceride reductions.
 Proof-of-concept for weight loss with GLP-1 receptor agonists has been demonstrated in clinical trials as short as one month. For example, 120 mg of orally administered danuglipron (PF-06882961) administered twice per day (BID) achieved a placebo-adjusted mean body weight loss of 5.5 kilograms (5.4%) in 28 days. In a Phase 2 study, 200 mg BID of danuglipron achieved a 5.2% placebo-adjusted weight loss over 12 weeks. Other oral GLP-1 receptor agonists under development have demonstrated range of weight loss results at various time points: at 6 weeks, 180 mg QD of lotiglipron (PF-07081532) demonstrated 3.3% placebo-adjusted weight loss in a diabetic population while at 12 weeks, 15 mg of LY-3502970 demonstrated 7.1% placebo-adjusted weight loss. The oral formulation of semaglutide, by contrast, achieved a 3% placebo-adjusted weight loss over 26 weeks at the 14 mg high dose.
 The development landscape for GLP-1 compounds is varied, including single agonists, multi-agonists, an agonist-antagonist combination and can be generally grouped by route of administration. Injectable candidates under development may target GLP-1 and glucagon (ALT-801, BI 456906, cotadutide and efinopegdutide), GLP-1 and GIP (tirzepatide), GLP-1 agonism and GIP antagonism (AMG 133) or GLP, GIP and glucagon (LY3437943), amongst others. Oral development candidates singly targeting GLP-1 and include LY3502970, danuglipron, lotiglipron (PF-07081532), GSBR-1290 and semaglutide tablets, amongst others.
 
Discovery of and approaches to GLP-1 receptor agonists
 Our GLP-1 scaffolds are designed using structure-based drug discovery efforts employing Terns' proprietary three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D QSAR) model of the GLP-1 receptor. Using reference data from GLP-1 molecules with known EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) data and active site binding properties, Terns' 3D QSAR model is able to predict new GLP-1 receptor agonist molecular activity with greater accuracy than traditional physics-based evaluations. Terns has screened over 20,000 molecular permutations to identify suitable small-molecule scaffolds with potentially improved properties relative to other GLP-1 based approaches. These candidates were further optimized based on in vitro activity, metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic parameters.
 Signaling pathways downstream of GLP-1, specifically β-arrestin signaling, have been hypothesized to result in reduced therapeutic durability and gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea. As a result, the biased agonism approach is being investigated by other drug developers. However, the advantages of mitigating β-arrestin signaling to enhance G-protein cAMP signaling and improve the side effect profile of a small molecule GLP-1R agonists remains unproven. Notably, a biased GLP-1 agonist avoiding β-arrestin signaling was efficacious in preclinical models (demonstrating glucose lowering and hypophagic effects in non-human primates), yet elicited vomiting, nausea, and headache in subsequent third-party clinical trials. Through our ongoing medicinal chemistry efforts, we have synthesized multiple compounds targeting GLP-1R that exhibit varying degrees of ligand bias towards G-protein cAMP and β-arrestin.
 
Limitations of GLP-1 receptor agonists
 Approved agents are synthetic peptides and potentially require higher doses administered by frequent subcutaneous injections for the potential treatment of obesity and NASH. The injectable route of administration is likely to limit their use in obesity and NASH patients, particularly if efficacious oral treatments become available. Although an oral GLP-1 peptide formulation is available for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, it requires high doses, is associated with adverse effects and lacks NASH efficacy data. A non-peptidic small-molecule oral GLP-1 receptor agonist may offer advantages over currently available peptide GLP-1R agonists that have been studied for the treatment of obesity and NASH.

Our solution for GLP-1 receptor agonists
 Our GLP-1 scaffolds are designed using structure-based drug discovery efforts employing our proprietary three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D QSAR) model of the GLP-1 receptor. Using reference data from GLP-1 molecules with known EC50 data and active site binding properties, our 3D QSAR model is able to predict new GLP-1 receptor agonist molecular activity with greater accuracy than traditional physics-based evaluations. We have screened over 20,000 molecular permutations to identify suitable small-molecule scaffolds with potentially improved properties relative to other GLP-1 based approaches.

Specific signaling pathways downstream of GLP-1, specifically β-arrestin signaling, have been hypothesized to result in reduced therapeutic durability and gastrointestinal adverse effects such as nausea. As a result, the biased agonism approach is being investigated by other drug developers. However, the advantages of mitigating β-arrestin signaling to enhance G-protein signaling and improve the side effect profile of a small molecule GLP-1R agonists remains unproven. Notably, a biased GLP-1 agonist avoiding β-arrestin signaling was efficacious in preclinical models (demonstrating glucose lowering and hypophagic effects in non-human primates), yet elicited vomiting, nausea, and headache in subsequent clinical trials. Through our ongoing medicinal chemistry efforts, we have synthesized multiple compounds targeting GLP-1R that exhibit varying degrees of ligand bias towards G-protein cAMP and β-arrestin.
Our lead molecule, TERN-601, is a potent GLP-1R agonist biased towards cAMP generation. The target product profile for TERN-601 is a potent, safe and effective small-molecule (non-peptide) with oral once-daily dosing, that may be suitable for combination or co-formulation and have applicability to obesity, NASH and other indications. We are conducting investigational new drug application (IND)-enabling activities for TERN-601 for obesity with the goal of initiating a first-in-human clinical trial in the second half of 2023 and announcing top-line data in 2024. We expect that this Phase 1 clinical program for TERN-601 will include a single ascending dose (SAD) trial in healthy volunteers and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) proof-of-concept trial in healthy volunteers with elevated BMI. The MAD trial is expected to assess changes in body weight and glycemic control parameters, such as HbA1c, over 28 days. Each of our GLP-1 candidate structures are believed to be suitable for oral administration as a single agent or in combination with other drug candidates, such as small molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators.
In addition to TERN-601, efforts are currently underway to nominate and develop structurally distinct second-generation small molecule GLP-1R agonists. Each of our GLP-1 candidate structures are believed to be suitable for oral administration as a single agent or in combination with other drug candidates, such as small molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulators.
 
Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) Receptor Modulators
 As part of our ongoing discovery efforts for the treatment of obesity, we initiated a small-molecule glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) modulator program, designated as the TERN-800 series. GIP is secreted in response to nutrient ingestion to enhance meal-stimulated insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner by activating its cognate GIPR in pancreatic beta cells and other cells in various tissues. In preclinical studies, GIPR activation appears to reduce food intake and promote weight loss when combined with its incretin partner GLP-1. The overlapping body weight-lowering actions of both GIP and GLP-1 suggests that combining the actions of these two peptide hormones may bolster glucose-lowering and appetite-suppressing effects beyond those observed with individual agents.
 In a preclinical study, two weeks of simultaneous administration of equimolar amounts of a GLP-1R agonist and a GIPR agonist reduced food intake, body weight and fat mass in mice to a greater extent than either agent alone. A late-stage clinical trial of injectable dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist tirzepatide (Lilly) demonstrated approximately 20% mean weight loss over 72 weeks of treatment. Notably, a human monoclonal antibody against the GIP receptor decreased food consumption and supported body weight loss alone and in combination with GLP-1R agonist dulaglutide in obese non-human primates.

A monomolecular combination of a GIPR antagonist/GLP-1R agonist, AMG 133 (Amgen), enhanced the observed weight loss in animal obesity models. In a Phase 1 clinical study of AMG 133, a single high dose resulted in approximately 8 kilograms of weight loss. In the MAD portion of the study, AMG 133 was administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks (Days 1, 29 and 57). The high-dose cohort of 420 mg demonstrated a mean body weight reduction that remained substantial (10%-15%) through approximately Day 150 of the study. Patients achieved a peak 14.5% mean decrease in body weight at Day 85 after finishing treatment on Day 57. At Day 207, without additional doses of AMG 133, body weight reduction remained approximately at 10% for the high-dose cohort. These early results suggest strong durability of effect for the GIPR antagonist/GLP1-R agonist approach.
 Similar to our discovery process for GLP-1, we have synthesized small molecule ligands targeting the GIP receptor and are currently assessing their activity. We plan to combine GIPR modulators with oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as TERN-601, for the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases. We believe our small molecules have the advantage of oral bioavailability and the ability to dose adjust to achieve an optimal response. Combining GIPR modulators with GLP-1 represents a promising strategy under investigation for the treatment of obesity.
 
Other Product Candidates
 As we continue to focus resources on the most advanced product candidates in our pipeline, we intend to explore strategic and partnership options for the development and commercialization of TERN-201, TERN-301, and TRN-000546.
 TERN-201 is an oral, highly-selective vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) inhibitor which has demonstrated sustained target engagement and complete, or near-complete (>98%), suppression of VAP-1 enzymatic activity in multiple clinical trials. Across approximately 100 subjects, TERN-201 was shown to be generally well-tolerated, without the off-target liabilities associated with other VAP-1 inhibitors in development.
 TERN-301 is a potent and selective orally bioavailable apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) inhibitor shown to have slow metabolic turnover in preclinical species, with low clearance, good oral absorption, and a low likelihood of drug-drug interactions. ASK1 is a protein kinase that plays a key role in mediating cell death signaling pathways. It is activated by various cellular stresses, such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and pro-inflammatory cytokines. ASK1 inhibitors may prevent downstream signaling and protect cells from stress-induced cell death and inflammation. TERN-301 showed superior selectivity compared to selonsertib against a panel of 370 kinases and in the methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD) model of NASH, TERN-301 showed improvements in NAFLD activity score and reduced expression of inflammatory related genes.
 TRN-000546 is a novel oral, liver directed, monophosphate prodrug of fluorodeoxyuridylate (FdUMP), the potent anti-tumor metabolite of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU, an antimetabolite and cell cycle-targeting chemotherapeutic drug, has been widely used to treat many cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TRN-000546 was designed to protect FdUMP from enzymatic deactivation in the plasma and improve its delivery into the liver to increase efficacy while minimizing systemic drug exposures to reduce potential toxicity. TRN-000546 is more potent than 5-FU against a wide range of tumor cell lines in cell proliferation assays in vitro and has demonstrated comparable or improved efficacy to standard-of-care treatment in multiple in vivo models of liver, gastric, and colon cancers.
 
Manufacturing and supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our drug candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract manufacturers for manufacturing all our drug candidates for preclinical research and clinical trials. We do not have long-term agreements with any of these third parties.
If any of our drug candidates are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with a third-party contract manufacturer and one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of those drugs. Development and commercial quantities of any drugs that we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval.


Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization. We intend to establish a targeted commercial infrastructure in key geographies at the appropriate time prior to regulatory approval of our single-agent drugs and fixed-dose combination therapies. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships.
In addition, we will opportunistically explore commercialization partnerships in territories outside the United States. As our drug candidates progress through our pipeline, our commercial plans may change. Clinical data, the size of the development programs, the size of our target markets, the size of a commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence our commercialization strategies.
Competition
 The biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We believe that our pipeline, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages. However, we face potential worldwide competition from many different sources, including large multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies and smaller or earlier stage biotechnology companies. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. Given the high incidence of NASH and obesity, it is likely that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of liver metabolic diseases, including NASH and obesity, will increase.

Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop, manufacture and market technologically superior products. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products. There are generic products currently on the market for certain of the indications that we are pursuing, and additional products are expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years. If our product candidates are approved, we expect that they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic products. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in undertaking preclinical studies and human clinical trials of new pharmaceutical products and in obtaining regulatory approvals of human therapeutic products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining FDA approval for superior products. Many of our competitors have established distribution channels for the commercialization of their products, whereas we have no such channel or capabilities. In addition, many competitors have greater name recognition and more extensive collaborative relationships. Smaller and earlier-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
Although we believe our product candidate programs possess appealing attributes, we cannot guarantee that our products will achieve regulatory or market success. Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we do, or obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our drug candidate or any future drug candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly, or have a better tolerability profile than our drugs. These competitors may also be more successful than we are in manufacturing and marketing their products. Should we not be able to compete with the aforementioned companies or others, it may hinder our ability to bring our product to market as planned.
Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our drug candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. For our patent portfolio for pipeline drug candidates, we seek to pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use and manufacture. Our policy is to pursue, maintain, defend and enforce patent rights in strategic areas, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, confidential information and other proprietary know-how that may be important to the development of our business.
As of February 21, 2023, our owned and exclusively licensed patent portfolio includes:
•For TERN-701, our small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, we own one patent family directed to composition-of-matter coverage of TERN-701 and its methods of use in the treatment of leukemia and other diseases and conditions. The patent family includes one issued U.S. patent and 20 pending patent applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EPO, India, Japan and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in the patent family are generally projected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions that may be available. This patent family is subject to an exclusive option and license agreement for the greater China region with Hansoh (Shanghai) Healthtech Co., Ltd. and Jiangsu Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Company Ltd., or collectively, Hansoh. For more information regarding this exclusive option and license agreement with Hansoh, please see “—Licensing and Other Intellectual Property-Related Agreements.”
 •For TERN-501, our THR-β agonist, we own five patent families which collectively are directed to composition-of-matter coverage of TERN-501 and its methods of use (including combination therapy) in the treatment of certain liver, metabolic and other diseases and conditions. The composition-of-matter patent family includes two issued U.S. patents, one pending U.S. application and 24 pending applications in foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the EPO, India, Japan and Korea. Any patents that may issue from applications in the composition-of-matter patent family are generally projected to expire in 2039, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions that may be available.
 •We own four patent families covering a number of GLP-1R agonists, including TERN-601. Any patents that may issue from applications in these patent families are generally projected to expire between 2041 and 2043, not including any patent term adjustments and any patent term extensions that may be available.
 •For TERN-101, our FXR agonist, we own ten patent families and exclusively license from Eli Lilly and Company, or Eli Lilly, two patent families, which collectively are directed to composition-of-matter coverage of TERN-101, its formulations and its methods of use (including combination therapy) in the treatment of certain liver, metabolic and other diseases and conditions. The composition-of-matter patent family currently includes one issued U.S. patent and over 20 granted foreign patents. The issued U.S. patent in the composition-of-matter patent family is projected to expire, inclusive of patent term adjustment, in 2029, not including any patent term extensions that may be available. Corresponding foreign patents are generally projected to expire in 2028, not including any patent term extensions that may be available. For more information regarding this exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly, please see “—Licensing and Other Intellectual Property-Related Agreements.” 
 Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection of our current and future drug candidates, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our drugs depends in large part on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed or licensed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to, or licensed by, us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our drug candidates, discovery programs and processes. Moreover, we cannot be sure that any of our owned or licensed patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug, in certain cases, may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term extension as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits such patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended and the amount of available extension to any extension-eligible patent which claims a product, a method of using a product or a method of manufacturing a product, depends on a variety of factors, including the date on which the patent issues and certain dates related to the regulatory review period. Provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drugs receive FDA or analogous foreign approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those drugs from the applicable authorities where patent term extension is available, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. There is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information of our business that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, including trade secrets and unpatented know-how, by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.
Moreover, third parties may still obtain this proprietary information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that information to compete with us. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets and know how the value of this information may be greatly reduced, and our competitive position would be harmed. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent or other intellectual property or other proprietary right would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or any of our drug candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Licensing and Other Intellectual Property-Related Agreements

TERN-701 Exclusive Option and License Agreement with Hansoh
In July 2020, we, along with our subsidiaries, CaspianTern LLC and Terns, Inc., entered into an exclusive option and license agreement with Hansoh pursuant to which we granted an exclusive option to Hansoh to obtain an exclusive, sub-licensable and royalty-bearing license under certain patent and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by us, including patents claiming the composition of TERN-701, our small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of the BCR-ABL fusion gene and methods of using the same, to research, develop, manufacture, use, distribute, sell and otherwise exploit therapeutic products containing TERN-701, or Hansoh Products, for all prophylactic, palliative, therapeutic and/or diagnostic uses in human diseases and disorders in the field of oncology in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, or the Hansoh Territory. In November 2021, Hansoh exercised its option to in-license TERN-701 in accordance with the terms of the exclusive option and license agreement. We retain co-exclusive rights under certain know-how licensed to Hansoh and all rights under the patent rights outside of the field of oncology and Hansoh Territory. We have entered into a manufacturing and technology transfer agreement with Hansoh pursuant to which we receive technical assistance and support for the manufacturing of TERN-701. Pursuant to the terms of the option and license agreement, Hansoh must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a Hansoh Product in the Hansoh Territory and Hansoh may not exploit any other product in the Hansoh Territory with the same primary mechanism of action as the Hansoh Products.
 As consideration for the exclusive option, we received an upfront, refundable payment of $1 million, which became non-refundable upon Hansoh’s exercise of its option in November 2021. Under the license, Hansoh has agreed to pay us up to an aggregate of $67.0 million upon the achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and sales milestones with respect to the Hansoh Products. No such milestones have been achieved to date under this option and license agreement. Hansoh must also pay us royalties of a mid-single digit percentage on net sales of all Hansoh Products. The royalty rate is subject to customary reductions, including reductions based on generic competition to the Hansoh Products and royalties paid to any third party under a license to such third party’s rights necessary to commercialize a Hansoh Product. The royalty term will terminate on a Hansoh Product-by-Hansoh Product and country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights covering such Hansoh Product in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such Hansoh Product in such country and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such Hansoh Product in such country.
Intellectual property developed out of the activities under this option and license agreement, and that is necessary or useful to exploit TERN-701 or Hansoh Products, solely developed by one party shall be owned by that party, and jointly-developed intellectual property shall be jointly-owned. Hansoh will have the first right to prosecute, maintain, defend and enforce the licensed patent rights in the Hansoh Territory.
The option and license agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the Hansoh Products in the Hansoh Territory. Upon expiration of the option and license agreement, the license under our know-how granted to Hansoh shall be considered fully paid-up, perpetual and co-exclusive. Either we or Hansoh may terminate the option and license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. Hansoh may terminate the option and license agreement upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Hansoh may also terminate the option and license agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice if we undergo certain change of control events. If Hansoh terminates the option and license agreement upon such change of control events, we must negotiate with Hansoh the terms of an assignment of our entire right, title and interest in and to TERN-701 and the Hansoh Products, including all intellectual property rights therein, in the Hansoh Territory and Hansoh shall provide us the fair market value of such assignment.
THR-β Agonist Assignment Agreement with Vintagence Biotechnology Ltd.
In June 2019, we entered into an assignment agreement with Vintagence Biotechnology Ltd., or Vintagence, pursuant to which Vintagence assigned to us certain worldwide intellectual property rights and know-how directed to THR-β agonists. In particular, we have been assigned all rights, title and interest in and to a Chinese patent application and any patents or patent applications resulting or derived therefrom in any country, know-how and potentially certain other patents or patent applications relating to our THR-β program. We are also entitled to license the rights granted to us under the assignment agreement to our affiliates, licensees or contractors. We will be responsible for all regulatory activities, including the obtaining of regulatory approvals for a product. We must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a product based on the assigned intellectual property in each of several major market territories.
During the term of the assignment agreement, Vintagence and its affiliates may not develop, manufacture, commercialize or otherwise exploit any compound covered by any of the assigned patent rights. In the event Vintagence develops a THR-β agonist not covered by the assigned patent rights, we will have the first right (but no obligation) to negotiate an assignment or license to exclusively develop, manufacture, commercialize or otherwise exploit such agonist worldwide.
As initial consideration for the assignment, we paid Vintagence an upfront payment of CNY 5 million ($0.7 million). As additional consideration, we are required to pay Vintagence up to an aggregate of CNY 205 million (approximately $32 million) upon the achievement of specified developmental, clinical and regulatory milestone events with respect to products covered by the agreement.
We have the sole responsibility and decision-making authority to prosecute the assigned patents. However, if we decline to pay the prosecution costs for any assigned patent, Vintagence shall have the right to prosecute such assigned patent. If Vintagence takes over prosecution of such assigned patent, we must assign such assigned patent back to Vintagence. We also have the first right (but no obligation) to enforce the assigned patents and know-how. If we do not take any steps to enforce any of the assigned patents or know-how against any infringing third party, Vintagence has the right to take any actions necessary to abate such infringement.
 The assignment agreement will continue on a country-by-country basis until we have paid all milestone payments. We may terminate the assignment agreement in its entirety or on a covered product-by-covered product and country-by-country basis without cause with 60 days’ prior written notice. Either party may terminate the assignment agreement for the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 90 days or for the other party’s bankruptcy, insolvency or similar arrangement for the benefit of creditors. If we terminate the assignment agreement without cause or if Vintagence terminates the assignment agreement for our uncured material breach, we must transfer the assigned intellectual property back to Vintagence.
TERN-101 License Agreement with Eli Lilly
In February 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Eli Lilly, or the TERN-101 License Agreement, pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable (subject to certain conditions), royalty-bearing license under certain intellectual property rights, including patents applications filed in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions claiming the composition of the compound Eli Lilly has designated as LY2562175 and methods of using the same and certain know-how related to the manufacture of LY2562175 owned or controlled by Eli Lilly to develop, manufacture and commercialize therapeutic products containing LY2562175, or TERN-101 Products, for all uses and indications in humans. Eli Lilly also has the right, on a country-by-country and TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis, to negotiate an agreement governing the co-promotion of TERN-101 Products if we, or our sublicensees, decide to commercialize a TERN-101 Product in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan.
Pursuant to the terms of the TERN-101 License Agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, apply for regulatory approval of and commercialize TERN-101 Products in the People’s Republic of China. In addition, Eli Lilly provided us, at its expense, certain support in connection with the transfer of the licensed materials.

As consideration for the exclusive license, we are required to pay Eli Lilly up to an aggregate of $56 million upon the achievement of pre-specified clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone events for TERN-101 Products. No such milestones have been achieved to date under the TERN-101 License Agreement.
We are also required to pay tiered royalties calculated on a calendar year basis, ranging from mid-single digit to mid teen percentages, on annual net sales of TERN-101 Products. The royalty rate is subject to customary reductions, including reductions based on certain generic competition to a TERN-101 Product and amounts paid to any third party under a necessary license to such third party’s patent rights in order to develop, manufacture, commercialize or use a TERN-101 Product. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country, TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights infringed by the sale of such TERN-101 Product in such country, (ii) the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such TERN-101 Product in such country and (iii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such TERN-101 Product in such country.
Any intellectual property or inventions developed solely by either party in connection with activities conducted pursuant to the TERN-101 License Agreement shall be owned solely by that party, and any jointly-developed intellectual property or inventions shall be jointly owned (although no joint development activities are anticipated). We have the sole responsibility to prosecute and maintain and the first right (but no obligation) to defend and enforce certain patents licensed under the TERN-101 License Agreement, including any patents that are solely and directly related to LY2562175 or TERN-101 Products.
The TERN-101 License Agreement shall expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the TERN-101 Products on a country-by-country basis. Upon expiration of the TERN-101 License Agreement, the license granted to us shall be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable, perpetual and non-exclusive. Either we or Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided, or in the event of insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country and TERN-101 Product-by-TERN-101 Product basis upon 180 days’ prior written notice. Eli Lilly may terminate the TERN-101 License Agreement if we, our affiliates or our sublicensees challenge the licensed patents or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents.
 
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Among others, the FDA, the European Commission, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements on companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. Any drug candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in those foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union, or EU, are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations.
A company, institution, or organization which takes responsibility for the initiation and management of a clinical development program for such products is referred to as a sponsor. A sponsor seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically secure the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations; 


•design of a clinical protocol and submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, after completion of all pivotal trials; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; 
 •potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States. 
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. These studies are generally referred to as IND-enabling studies. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages, dose tolerance and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
In December 2022, with the passage of Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act, or FDORA, Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan for each phase 3 clinical trial or any other “pivotal study” of a new drug or biological product. These plans are meant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA-regulated products. Specifically, actions plans must include the sponsor’s goals for enrollment, the underlying rationale for those goals, and an explanation of how the sponsor intends to meet them. In addition to these requirements, the legislation directs the FDA to issue new guidance on diversity action plans.
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
Sponsors of clinical trials are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public registry (clinicaltrials.gov) maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH. In particular, information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Although the FDA has historically not enforced these reporting requirements due to the long delay by the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, in issuing final implementing regulations, the FDA has issued several Notices of Noncompliance to manufacturers since April 2021. The failure to submit required clinical trial information to clinicaltrials.gov is a prohibited act under the FDCA with violations subject to potential civil monetary penalties of up to $10,000 for each day the violation continues.
 
Pediatric Studies
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the FDASIA in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans (if required under PREA), before the date on which the sponsor submits the required assessments or investigation and no later than either 60 calendar days after the date of the end-of-phase 2 meeting or such other time as agreed upon between FDA and the sponsor. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The sponsor, the FDA, and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the sponsor may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the sponsor, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product or therapeutic candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric trials begin. Pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, the FDA must send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. FDASIA further requires the FDA to publicly post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response.
 

U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA’s regulations state that an application “shall not be considered as filed until all pertinent information and data have been received.” In the event that FDA determines that an application does not satisfy this standard, it will issue a Refuse to File, or RTF, determination to the applicant. The FDA may also request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The actual review time may be significantly longer, depending on the complexity of the review, FDA requests for additional information and the sponsor’s submission of additional information.
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. With passage of FDORA, Congress clarified FDA’s authority to conduct inspections by expressly permitting inspection of facilities involved in the preparation, conduct, or analysis of clinical and non-clinical studies submitted to FDA as well as other persons holding study records or involved in the study process.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.

If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may contain limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.

Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may also designate a product candidate as a “Breakthrough Therapy” if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. An NDA for a product candidate is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoints, and to begin such a study prior to accelerated approval, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

Further, with passage of the FDORA in December 2022, Congress modified certain provisions governing accelerated approval of drug and biologic products. Specifically, the new legislation authorized the FDA to: require a sponsor to have its confirmatory clinical trial underway before accelerated approval is awarded, require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to submit progress reports on its post-approval studies to FDA every six months (until the study is completed; and use expedited procedures to withdraw accelerated approval of an NDA or BLA after the confirmatory trial fails to verify the product’s clinical benefit. FDORA also requires the agency to publish on its website “the rationale for why a post-approval study is not appropriate or necessary” whenever it decides not to require such a study upon granting accelerated approval.
 Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.

Post-approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which was enacted in December 2022, clarifies that foreign drug manufacturing establishments are subject to registration and listing requirements even if a drug or biologic undergoes further manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing at a separate establishment outside the United States prior to being imported or offered for import into the United States.
 Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use.
Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or untitled letters; 
 •clinical holds on clinical studies; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; 
 •the issuance of safety alerts, “dear doctor” letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments.
It may be permissible, under very specific, narrow conditions, for a manufacturer to engage in nonpromotional, non-misleading communication regarding off-label information, such as distributing scientific or medical journal information. Moreover, with passage of the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act, or PIE Act, in December 2022, sponsors of products that have not been approved may proactively communicate to payors certain information about products in development to help expedite patient access upon product approval. Previously, such communications were permitted under FDA guidance but the new legislation explicitly provides protection to sponsors who convey certain information about products in development to payors, including unapproved uses of approved products.
 The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labeling.

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

Regulatory Exclusivity
Regulatory exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of regulatory exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
In the United States, the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, provides incentives for the development of drugs for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States (or for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the United States for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the drug in the United States). Certain of the incentives turn on the drug first being designated as an orphan drug. To be eligible for designation as an orphan drug (Orphan Drug Designation), the drug must have the potential to treat such rare disease or condition as described above. In addition, the FDA must not have previously approved a drug considered the “same drug,” as defined in the FDA’s orphan drug regulations, for the same orphan-designated indication or the sponsor of the subsequent drug must provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the previously approved same drug. Upon receipt of Orphan Drug Designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 25% for qualified clinical trial expenses and waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act application fee. In addition, upon marketing approval, an orphan-designated drug could be eligible for seven years of market exclusivity if no drug considered the same drug was previously approved for the same orphan condition (or if the subsequent drug is demonstrated to be clinically superior to any such previously approved same drug). Such orphan drug exclusivity, if awarded, would only block the approval of any drug considered the same drug for the same orphan indication. Moreover, a subsequent same drug could break an approved drug’s orphan exclusivity through a demonstration of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug.
A recent Eleventh Circuit decision in Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vs. FDA regarding interpretation of the Orphan Drug Act exclusivity provisions as applied to drugs approved for orphan indications narrower than the drug’s orphan designation has the potential to adversely impact whether certain label expansions would qualify for orphan exclusivity. Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this decision, they have not been enacted into law. On January 23, 2023, FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that court order, FDA will continue to apply its existing regulations tying orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which the orphan drug was approved.


Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory exclusivity to the term of any existing unexpired patent or regulatory exclusivity, including orphan drug exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data about the active moiety in the product. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.
 
Foreign Government Regulation
Our product candidates will be subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by jurisdictions outside of the United States, and, in particular, the European Union, or EU, which may include, for instance, applicable clinical trial, marketing authorization and post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign jurisdictions. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
Regulations Governing Marketing Authorization of Medicinal Products in the EU

Non-clinical studies and clinical trials
  Similar to the United States, the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Non-clinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new biological substances. Non-clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice, or GLP, as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, non-clinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for non-clinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonisation, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, as set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2017/556, EU Regulation (EU) 2016/679, or GDPR, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU member states, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.

While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate clinical trial application, or CTA, to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.
The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose CTA was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, sponsors were able to choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.
 Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice, or GMP, as set out in EU Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/1569. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 
Marketing Authorization
 In order to market our future product candidates in the EU and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EU, medicinal product candidates can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product. There are two types of MAs:
•“centralized MAs,” which are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and are valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of product candidates, such as (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) designated orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicinal products and (iv) medicinal products indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune or other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for any products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which the granting of a MA would be in the interest of public health in the EU; and 
 •“national MAs,” which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states, only cover their respective territory, and are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU member states make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.

MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
 The European Commission is expected to publish new proposed legislation in March 2023 which, if adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, will introduce significant number of changes to the regulatory procedures described above.
 
Adaptive pathways
 The EMA has adaptive pathways programs which allow for early and progressive patient access to a medicine. The adaptive pathways concept is an approach to medicines approval that aims to improve patients’ access to medicines which have potential to address unmet medical needs. To achieve this goal, several approaches are envisaged: identifying small populations with severe disease where a medicine’s benefit-risk balance could be favorable; making more use of real-world data where appropriate to support clinical trial data; and involving health technology assessment bodies early in development to increase the chance that medicines will be recommended for payment and ultimately covered by national healthcare systems. The adaptive pathways concept applies primarily to treatments in areas of high medical need where it is difficult to collect data via traditional routes and where large clinical trials would unnecessarily expose patients who are unlikely to benefit from the medicine. The approach builds on regulatory processes already in place within the existing EU legal framework. These include: scientific advice; compassionate use; the conditional approval mechanism (for medicines addressing seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases or rare diseases); patient registries and other pharmacovigilance tools that allow collection of real-life data and development of a risk-management plan for each medicine.
The adaptive pathways program does not change the standards for the evaluation of benefits and risks or the requirement to demonstrate a positive benefit-risk balance to obtain MA.

PRIME scheme
 In July 2016, the EMA launched the PRIME scheme. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation includes the appointment of a rapporteur from the Committee for Medicinal Product candidates for Human Use before submission of an MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify product candidates for accelerated review earlier in the application process.

Data and marketing exclusivity
The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, or reference medicinal products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, the data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall 10-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 In March 2023, the European Commission is expected to publish new proposed legislation. If adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, this legislation will introduce new data and market exclusivity periods which are likely to include additional requirements and modulation mechanisms.



Post-approval requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAA must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another. A new legislative proposal by the European Commission expected to be published in March 2023 is likely to contain new proposed rules restricting comparative advertising of medicinal products in the EU.
 Failure to comply with the aforementioned EU and member state laws may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, suspension of the conduct of clinical trials, rejection of clinical trial data, or refusal to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal, revocation or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union took place on January 31, 2020. The European Union and the United Kingdom. reached an agreement on their new partnership in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Agreement, which was applied provisionally beginning on January 1, 2021 and which entered into force on May 1, 2021. The Agreement focuses primarily on free trade by ensuring no tariffs or quotas on trade in goods, including healthcare products such as medicinal products. Thereafter, the European Union and the United Kingdom will form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. As such, the Agreement seeks to minimize barriers to trade in goods while accepting that border checks will become inevitable as a consequence that the United Kingdom is no longer part of the single market.
As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or the MHRA, became responsible for supervising medicines and medical devices in Great Britain, comprising England, Scotland and Wales under domestic law whereas Northern Ireland continues to be subject to European Union rules under the Northern Ireland Protocol. The MHRA will rely on the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (SI 2012/1916) (as amended), or the HMR, as the basis for regulating medicines. The HMR has incorporated into the domestic law the body of EU law instruments governing medicinal products that pre-existed prior to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU. The MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization via the centralized procedure until December 31, 2023.
 

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls, inflationary rebates and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales.
Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular therapy to currently available therapies or so-called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Other countries may allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products and medical devices will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Government Drug Price Reporting
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the 340B drug pricing program, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule program, and other governmental drug pricing programs require participating manufacturers to report certain product and pricing data to the government. Pricing calculations vary among products and programs, are complex, and are often subject to interpretation by manufacturers, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts, which can change and evolve over time. Manufacturers may be held liable for errors associated with submission of data under these programs, including potential civil monetary penalties per item of falsely reported or misrepresented drug pricing information. Such failure also could be grounds for other sanctions, such as termination from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Further, a growing number of states have enacted drug price transparency laws requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to report information to certain state agencies and other parties. Many of these laws provide for civil monetary penalties and other enforcement mechanisms if manufacturers are found to have violated requirements.
Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the ACA has been challenged at the U.S. Supreme Court multiple times since its enactment. While in 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which will remain in effect through 2032 absent additional congressional action, with the exception of a temporary suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 (with a 1% payment reduction from April 1 to June 30, 2022). Additionally, under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (Statutory PAYGO), the Administration is required to issue a sequestration order (capped at 4% for Medicare payments) if the PAYGO scorecard shows a net cost at the end of a Congressional session. Although Statutory PAYGO was expected to be triggered at the end of the 2021 Congressional session, subsequent legislation has delayed a Statutory PAYGO sequestration order until after 2024. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
 For example, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years.
 Specifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at 2,000 a year.

In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.

Data Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information, and could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. The FTC, in particular, has especially been focused on the use and disclosure of health information in its recent enforcement actions, which could increase the risk related to our business. At the state level, five states to date—California (CCPA/CPRA), Colorado (CPA), Connecticut (CTDPA), Utah (UDPA) and Virginia (VCDPA)—have enacted omnibus consumer privacy laws, each of which provides special provisions regarding the privacy of health-related information, and each of which provides for civil enforcement, including the levying of fines for violations. Moreover, the CPRA imposes consumer privacy obligations on businesses with respect to their California-based employees and business contacts. Additionally, California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (H. R. 8152)—which provides for both civil enforcement and a private right of action—imposes specific obligations on pharmaceutical companies with respect to the privacy of medical information. Each of these state laws could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. We note, too, that a draft federal omnibus privacy law—the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (H. R. 8152)—is currently pending in Congress and may impose additional obligations and risks if enacted.

In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the GDPR imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. The GDPR prohibits the transfer of personal data from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to countries outside of the EEA unless made to a country deemed to have adequate data privacy laws by the European Commission or a data transfer mechanism has been put in place. The EU-US Privacy Shield was such a transfer mechanism put in place by the EU and the United States, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated for international transfers of personal data in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU. A replacement of the Privacy Shield is currently being developed. On 13 December 2022, following the signature of a US Executive Order by President Biden on 7 October 2022, the European Commission issued a draft adequacy decision which, if adopted and not successfully challenged in court, is intended to address the concerns expressed by CJEU in their 2016 ruling and allow transfer of personal data from the EEA to companies in the US which commit to comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. At the moment it is unclear if the adequacy decision will be adopted at EU level and whether the anticipated legal challenges against this decision, which may similar to the challenge that led to the invalidation of the Privacy Shield, would be successful. In June 2021, the European Commission adopted new SCCs that are designed to be a mechanism by which entities can transfer personal information out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection. The SCCs require parties that rely upon that legal mechanism to comply with additional obligations, such as conducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect the transferred personal information. The competent authorities and courts in a number of EU Member States increasingly scrutinize and question the GDPR compliance of processing of personal data by US-based entities or entities with links to US-based entities, independently of whether personal data is actually transferred outside the EEA. In June 2021, the CJEU issued a ruling that expanded the scope of the “one stop shop” under the GDPR. According to the ruling, the competent authorities of EU Member States may, under certain strict conditions, bring claims to their national courts against a company for breaches of the GDPR, including unlawful cross-border processing activities, even such company does not have an establishment in the EU member state in question and the competent authority bringing the claim is not the lead supervisory authority.
