ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 
Chilean Cobalt Corp. (“C3,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” or “us”) is a critical materials exploration and development company focused on developing the La Cobaltera project located in Chile’s historic San Juan cobalt district. C3 is mission-driven as an innovator and leader that strives to be the most responsible supplier of critical mineral resources for the development of advanced materials and cleaner energy technologies that address the most pressing environmental and development issues. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context indicates otherwise, “C3,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” or “us” refer to Chilean Cobalt Corp., a Nevada corporation, and its sole subsidiary, Baltum Mineria SpA.
 
Given the transformational shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles (EVs), there has been an increase in demand for cobalt, a critical battery material in lithium-ion batteries that EVs use, along with copper as well. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Baltum Mineria SpA (“Baltum”) has acquired 2,635 hectares of fully exploitable mining concessions in northern Chile’s Atacama region in the San Juan District. The Company continues to seek opportunities to further consolidate mining rights in the district. The San Juan mining district, which includes the La Cobaltera area, has been identified by CORFO, the Chilean governmental agency responsible for the country’s economic development, as likely containing the highest quality cobalt assets in Chile. Chile already being the leading copper-producing country in the world with the La Cobaltera area historically supporting the existence of established and high-quality copper assets. Being strategically located near roads, electricity, water, and ports, the site is in close proximity to robust mining infrastructure. The Company’s principal business activities since incorporation have been the assessment, acquisition and consolidation of mining concessions; the exploration of the potential cobalt-copper resources within the concessions; and developing an accelerated phased implementation plan to generate revenue as quickly as possible.
 
We have not generated revenues to date. Our limited operations have included the formation of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Baltum Mineria SpA, oversight of cobalt exploration activities, and business development activities. These limited operations have been funded by capital raised through the issuance of our common stock, preferred stock, and debt. From December 4, 2017 through March 24, 2023, we raised a total of $29,209,536 from accredited investors through the issuance of our common stock, preferred stock, and debt.
 
We have limited business operations and have achieved losses since inception. We have been issued a going concern opinion from our auditors as a result of not generating sufficient business to date.
 
Our monthly “burn rate,” the amount of expenses we expect to incur on a monthly basis, is approximately $79,000 for a total of $948,000 for the following 12 months. We have relied and will continue to rely on capital raised from third parties to fund operations during the following 12 months.
 
In order to complete our plan of operations, we estimate that approximately $160 million in funds will be required.
 
Our management has concluded that our historical recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations as well as our dependence on securing private equity and other financings raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our auditor has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit reports for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As noted in our financial statements, we had an accumulated stockholders’ deficit of approximately $31,207,496 and recurring losses from operations as of December 31, 2022. See “Risk Factors - We have a history of operating losses and our management has concluded that factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and our auditor has included an explanatory paragraph relating to our ability to continue as a going concern in its audit report for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.”

Our Market Opportunity
 
Our market opportunity is driven by the generational opportunity emerging from the rapidly changing ways that the world produces, stores, and consumes energy. As adoption rates of electric vehicles across the entire transportation spectrum increase, and efficient battery-based renewable energy generation storage becomes more mainstream, thereby causing the demand for critical materials to increase dramatically, we believe that the scope of our market opportunity becomes materially more meaningful and global.
 
Electric Vehicle (“EV”) market penetration is expected to be a major driver of growth, as specifically indicated in the following chart for passenger vehicles in the BloombergNEF (“BNEF” or “Bloomberg”) EV Outlook 2022 forecast of greater than 40% global (dashed line in the chart) penetration by 2030 for share of sales under its economic transition scenario. Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (“BMI” or “Benchmark”) forecasts the EV battery market to grow at a 26% CAGR at the tier 3 level and higher growth rates on average across all tiers through 2031, reaching an annual sales volume of approximately 36.7 million vehicles per BNEF Aug 2021 estimates. In the long term, BNEF forecasts the global EV penetration in the passenger vehicle space to exceed 70% market share by 2040, which given projections on expansion of overall annual passenger vehicle sales between now and 2040 is projected to represent sales of around 66.2 million passenger EV units per year by that point in time per BNEF August 2021 estimates.

More importantly, as shown in the chart below, BNEF believes we are at or near an inflection point in the overall passenger vehicle fleet, where the internal combustion engine (“ICE”) numbers have peaked and will only begin to steadily decline over time as sales of alternative drivetrain light-duty vehicles take an increasingly larger cut of the future annual sales volume and annual fleet retirements reduce the volume of older, obsolete and damaged vehicles, which are predominantly ICE-based.

The International Energy Agency (“IEA”) has projected unit volumes of EV’s produced by year under discreet scenarios for various types of vehicles. These projections go beyond the passenger vehicle projections, as depicted in the following chart.
 

The IEA projects a 200 million EV fleet by 2030, under its most conservative and not necessarily global climate goals achieving scenario and this excludes the 2-wheel and 3-wheel segments. Passenger light-duty EV sales dominate this estimate in excess of 85% of the overall volume. These EV sales require a corresponding volume of battery or fuel cell production to accommodate EV production. If governments and other stakeholders were to incentivize meeting the net zero emissions by 2050 targets, the overall EV fleet would be projected to increase by about 75% to in excess of a 350 million EV fleet. IEA in the chart that follows later in the Industry Demand section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K on page 9, indicated that there is a 15% reduction in cobalt demand equivalent to approximately 35 kilo-tonnes per year between their 2030 base versus constrained methodologies. From this it can be deduced that they project over 233 kilo-tonnes per year base-case and 198 kilo-tonnes per year constrained. To put that in perspective, Statista indicates that there was 170,000 kilo-tonnes of cobalt produced in 2021. Therefore, as it pertains to light-duty vehicles only, albeit the behemoth in the EV sector, by 2030, it is projected that at least 16% or more in cobalt production will be needed than at present. Add to that uses of cobalt for battery applications outside of light-duty vehicles and materials and other technology applications outside the EV spectrum, there will absolutely be a need for expansion of cobalt sourcing to meet demand. Given environmental and global climate considerations, there will be an even bigger demand for responsibly sourced cobalt, given that over 70% of current production comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”), as discussed later in the Quality of Primary Cobalt Project and Potential Producer of Cobalt outside of the DRC section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K on page 5. Demand for copper is expected to increase as well, albeit not quite to the extent of Cobalt, given that copper sources aren’t nearly as constrained.

Government policies around the world have been accommodating and supportive of EV adoption. The U.S., for example, recently signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which has environmental provisions targeted at providing credits toward the purchase of EV’s meeting certain favorable trade criteria. While there is concern over the ability for companies to meet the favorable trade criteria and for end-consumers to qualify for the credits, we believe that it is an indication of the commitment to incentivizing the transition process at the highest levels of government. In addition to penetration targets, other countries have proposed banning sales of internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles by various deadlines, with 2030 being a common goal year for such policies.
 
Battery cell manufacturing has also been the beneficiary of billions in investment, with currently planned “gigafactories” totaling a capacity of 6,388 GWh projected to be deployed by 2031 per the BMI chart presented previously. If all of the planned plants were realized and produced at 100% capacity, the impact on battery raw materials markets would be extraordinary, causing demand for cobalt to expand to over 6X its current level.
 
Although the growth of EVs has given market fundamentals strength in the near term, energy storage provides a whole new source of growing battery material demand over the longer term. Renewable Grid Storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on a large scale within an electric power grid. Electrical energy is stored during times when production, particularly from select alternative sources like wind, tidal, and solar, exceeds consumption and is activated when electricity production falls below consumption. In an electrical power grid without battery energy storage, energy sources that rely on fossil fuels must be scaled up and down to match the rise and fall of energy production from intermittent energy sources. As in EVs, batteries in a grid storage system can store excess energy, mitigating peak-power demand pricing, and decouple intermittent power generation from demand. The capital cost of a utility-scale lithium-ion battery storage system is expected to decrease another 27 – 57% by 2030 per the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (“NREL”). NREL projects that cost decreases could range from 0 – 38% additional between 2030 and 2050. Moreover, BNEF forecasts call for Renewable Grid Storage to grow at a 30% CAGR through 2030, while Brandessence Market Research projected a 27.68% CAGR in taking the Battery Storage Market to nearly 50 billion by 2028.

Quality of Primary Cobalt Project and Potential Producer of Cobalt outside of the DRC
 
C3’s management believes that C3 holds a potentially world-class, scarce mining project with a robust demand profile. Only one primary cobalt mine operates globally, and in 2021 an estimated 70.6% of global cobalt supply was sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo by USGS statistics. Security and reliability of supply is critically important for EV battery and car manufacturers, and supply risk is high due to the concentration of cobalt coming from one source. Historical mine operations and production data associated with this mining jurisdiction lowers the risk that would be associated with a greenfield project and likely increases the speed of execution. The resource has the potential to be a Tier-1 asset, and the unique characteristics of the spatial layout of the resource allow for effective use of multiple mining techniques and processing technologies.
 
Low-Cost Provider, Extensive Process Technology and Know-How
 
The C3 operating team, including its outside consultants, is comprised of a host of professionals with decades of financial, geological and mining experience and expertise. As the Company adds sub-projects to the overall La Cobaltera strategic plan, the scope of our services and materials will expand, providing low-cost benefits and opportunities to increase the pipeline.
 
Culture of Safety and Sustainability
 
Safety and sustainability are core values of our business and a critical part of our value proposition. C3 is developing ESG-focused goals, measures, and targets that are aligned with leading standards from the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”), the International Sustainability Standards Board (“ISSB”), and the initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (“IRMA”) initiatives, in addition to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards under development in the European Union (“EU”) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) Climate-Related Disclosures. We believe our commitment to safety and sustainability is part of what will make us a preferred supplier and customer within the lithium-ion battery ecosystem.

Our Industry
 
Electric Vehicles
 
Spurred by the necessity to aggressively reduce carbon dioxide emissions to preserve the environment and reverse negative effects that have occurred to date, the shift from a global economy mobilized by fossil fuels to one powered by electricity is underway. This transition is no less than revolutionary in terms of the ongoing effects it will have on global civilization. Like the industrial revolution and the rise of the internet in the 1990’s, this is the next major transformative event to shape global economics and everyday human life. Consumer electronics was the first major industry to experience the trend toward electrification. Being in the early stages of the shift from internal combustion engines (“ICE”) to electric vehicles (“EV”), EVs are the segment that is currently receiving the most attention and exponential growth is expected in the near term. Energy grid storage will also become part of the trend to enable scaling of renewable energy like solar and wind. The world is going electric and green. This will require large-scale expansion in energy storage capacity. The best available technology for doing this now and for the foreseeable future is the lithium-ion battery (“LIB”), especially when weight and size are major considerations. This is why LIB technology is the energy storage of choice when it comes to e-mobility. Next-generation EV battery technology is still going to be LIB based, with innovation likely centering on the anode and electrolyte solution. The cathode has seen most of the innovation to date.
 
In the future, we envision a world where everyday life runs on batteries, and ipso facto, materials critical to the manufacture of batteries will see substantial increases in demand. These materials include lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and copper, among others. For a company to maximize shareholder value and capitalize on the creation of incremental demand for these materials, the technology and expertise to extract, process, combine, and recycle the materials is required.
 
Cobalt
 
Cobalt, a transition metal found between iron and nickel on the periodic table, is a hard, lustrous, grayish-silver metallic element with low thermal and electrical conductivity. The unique properties of cobalt and cobalt products are responsible for its extensive applications in energy storage, industrial and other areas. These characteristics include its high energy density, ability to alloy and impart strength at high temperatures, and ferromagnetic properties.
 
Cobalt naturally occurs in three mineral ore forms: cobaltite, smaltite, and erythrite. Concentration levels of the metal are often too low to be extracted economically, so it is usually mined as a byproduct of copper or nickel mining, with economically viable concentration levels usually observed between 0.1% and 0.5%. Ore is extracted, processed and converted into either cobalt metal or a cobalt chemical compound and delivered to chemical manufacturers. Potential chemical compounds include cobalt carbonate, cobalt sulfate, and cobalt salt derivatives. The vast majority of demand for these compounds comes from the rechargeable battery segment.

Cobalt applications can be divided into two primary categories: chemical and metallurgical. Based on research by the CRU Group on behalf of the Cobalt Institute for 2021, the batteries market, including consumer batteries (smartphones, tablets, other electronic devices) and EVs, currently accounts for approximately 87% of cobalt chemical demand and about 65% of overall cobalt demand. Metallurgical cobalt is the second largest cobalt consuming market at approximately 25% of overall cobalt demand. This is used primarily to produce superalloys consisting of cobalt combined with other metals such as nickel and/or iron. These alloys are surface stable and resistant to heat, corrosion and oxidation, which makes them valuable to and widely used by the aerospace, electricity generation, aircraft, medical, automotive, and military-related industries. Other applications for metallurgical cobalt include hard metals and diamond tools, catalysts in oil and gas refinement, and pigments.
 
Cobalt in Lithium-ion Batteries
 
Lithium-ion batteries that contain cobalt have high energy density, making them lightweight and efficient in terms of energy delivered relative to size, which helps to maximize EV driving range. Cobalt’s properties also give it distinct advantages in improving the longevity and safety of lithium-ion batteries, as its tight molecular compound structure allows for a high cycling ability – shorter recharge times and more charging and recharging cycles, and its high heat capacity provides good thermal stability to battery chemistries.
 
Lithium-ion battery cathodes come in a variety of chemistries, some of which contain cobalt and others that do not contain cobalt. The main cobalt containing chemistries are: lithium cobalt oxide (“LCO”) – LiCoO2, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (“NMC”) – LiNiMnCoO2, and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (“NCA”) – LiNiCoAlO2. The NMC chemistry is the dominant chemistry of the cobalt-containing configurations.
 
In the chart that follows in the “Industry Demand” section from the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), it can be seen that by 2030, cobalt-containing chemistries are expected to have somewhere in the range of 28% (constrained case) to 59% (base case) of the overall light-duty vehicle battery chemistry demand, while non-cobalt-containing substitutes, such as lithium iron phosphate (“LFP”) are expected to hold the balance of the market. The constrained case is where a prolonged period of higher battery metal prices pushes automakers toward alternatives.
 
Within the NMC chemistry is the question of what ratio of cobalt to other metals is optimal. NMC532, NMC622, NMC811 and NMC 9.5.5. NMC 811 or NMC 9.5.5 appear to be the most likely NMC chemistry sub-types to become the cobalt-containing battery cathode market leader. However, projections suggest that LFP will become the overall market leader for battery cathodes (i.e., overall for cobalt and non-cobalt containing cathodes). The emergence of chemistries with less cobalt or no cobalt are a definite consideration for long-term cobalt demand. Scientists, however, continue to lament the technical difficulties of implementing low- or no-cobalt configurations, such as the 811 chemistry, for large-scale applications. The bottom line is cobalt is a necessary element to produce lithium-ion batteries with high energy densities coupled with favorable thermal stability profiles. The most likely scenario is that the rate of decrease of cobalt content in batteries will be far outstripped by the rapid increase in demand for lithium-ion batteries due to the exponential growth in the adoption of EVs, as depicted in the following chart.

Industry Demand
 
The growth forecasted in the EV market has resulted in a significant increase in current and expected future demand for battery-grade cobalt compounds. AllianceBernstein (“AB”) as presented in The Economist projected EV battery capacity to increase from approximately 460 Gwh in 2022 to around 2.7TWh in 2030. This has EV battery capacity tracking at more than 40% of the overall LIB demand as depicted in the BMI gigafactory projections presented earlier. In the Cobalt Market Report 2021, released in May 2022, the Cobalt Institute projected medium term increases in cobalt demand from 175 kilotonnes in 2021 to around 320 kilotonnes by 2026, rising at a CAGR of 12.7% over that period. IEA projections are more cautious, expecting the market for EV-related uses of cobalt will increase by 2030 to somewhere between 250 kilotonnes to as much as 295 kilotonnes of annual cobalt demand, unless countries align with a net zero emissions by 2050 (“NZE”) standard, in which case annual demand for cobalt could be expected to reach as much as 410 kilotonnes by the end of that period.

In 2021 EV applications were the largest end-use sector for cobalt as depicted in the following chart compiled by CRU on behalf of the Cobalt Institute. This was the first year ever that EV applications were the predominant end-use sector and expectations are that this sector will only continue to increase its spread compared to other end use applications in the coming years.
 


As of forecasts prepared in late 2020, BMI projected cobalt demand for battery applications to increase from 66,000 tonnes in 2020 to just over 1.1 million tonnes in 2040. Adding in the cobalt demand forecast for non-battery applications, total cobalt demand is expected to reach 1.2 million mt in 2040 from a current level of ~159,000 tonnes, for a predicted CAGR of 11.9%.
 
Additionally, IEA forecasts that by 2030, demand for the NMC-High Nickel type of batteries, which includes the NMC811 cathode chemistry, will range from approximately 13% (constrained) to 27% (base) across all battery chemistries, as depicted in the following chart. As indicated in the earlier BMI chart, while cobalt usage is expected to decrease through 2026, the annual demand is expected to increase substantially through that same period. Therefore, even using relatively conservative assumptions for cobalt-containing battery chemistries, this illustrates that the rapid growth of EV market penetration is likely to still create a substantial increase in cobalt demand in the EV space and overall. This expectation aligns well with the earlier projections that have total annual cobalt demand close to or more than doubling by 2030, depending on the scenario and underlying assumptions. These estimates are roughly in line with a 2022 BNEF projection for a 1.5X increase in demand for cobalt from lithium-ion batteries for 2030 compared to 2021.

Industry Supply
 
Cobalt is a fairly rare metal, comprising only 0.001% of the earth’s crust, though widely dispersed and commonly found and obtained in association with other mining activities. More commonly, cobalt is found in ores of iron, nickel, copper, silver, manganese, zinc, and arsenic. Cobalt is usually mined as a by-product of either nickel, copper, or other more abundant metals. Most cobalt production is ultimately dependent on the production of copper and nickel, and the mined ore often contains only 0.1% - 0.5% elemental cobalt. Global cobalt reserves are estimated by the United States Geological Survey as of January 2021 to be about 7.1 million tonnes with just over 50% of these reserves located in the DRC.
 
Per USGS estimates, mined cobalt production for 2021 was estimated at roughly 170,000 tonnes of mined supply produced. As stated earlier in the “Quality of Primary Cobalt Project and Potential Producer of Cobalt outside of the DRC” section, approximately 70.6% of the current supply comes from the DRC. The next largest mining producer of cobalt is Russia, with around a 4.5% market share.
 
IEA projects that annual cobalt supply will just exceed approximately 300 kilotonnes by 2030 and this will approximately pace the overall demand as referenced earlier in the “Industry Demand” section. This balancing presumes that NZE models aren’t the prevailing scenario, as that would predict much higher demands and imbalances with supply. The following chart is IEA’s long-term cobalt supply forecast, which shows a substantial ramp-up in the quantity of cobalt supplied to the market, particularly over the next few years. IEA expected a CAGR of approximately 12% over the period from 2020 to 2025. In the chart, the y axis represents quantity in kilotonnes, the supply is represented by the light blue highlighted bars, whereas, the green and gold lines and red shaded bars, represent demand for the stated policies scenario (status quo), announced pledges scenario (greater action taken) and NZE scenario, respectively. It should be noted that the supply forecasts by IEA were derived from BMI information and as such, the forecast is likely to include mined production from expected and potential future producers who have a quantifiable probability of bringing supply to market over the projection timeframe, which is a characteristic attribute of BMI projections.

Industry Supply, Demand, and Pricing Dynamics
 
Cobalt is presently in a state of surplus, as more material is being supplied to the market than there is demand. However, as depicted in the side-by-side charts from BMI that follow, annual shortages compared to current and projected sources of supply are expected to begin within the next few years and only get more pronounced with each successive year. By 2040 this shortfall is anticipated to be as drastic as 800 kilotonnes, unless presently unknown sources of potential or proven reserves come online, are exploited and add to the anticipated supply volumes. This shortfall is nearly 5X the 2021 overall global cobalt production. The charts show the situation from a balance of supply and demand to a gap in supply and demand perspective and vary the presentation by showing highly probable supply apart from probable, possible and secondary sources.
 





By observing any trailing 5-year historical charts, it is evident that Cobalt pricing suffered from the second half of 2018 through early 2019. This was primarily due to negative sentiment and increased short-term supply. The price remained fairly flat from its low in early 2019 until around mid-2020, where squeezed supply from the Covid-19 pandemic along with increasing demand, due to the EV transition needs caused prices to start climbing toward their peak around $82,000USD per tonne in early-March 2022 through mid-May 2022. Prices have receded to a more balanced supply-demand state around $50,000USD per tonne from mid-July 2022 to present.
 
The cobalt market is a relatively small niche market compared to other metals and commodities, and much of the supply is tied up in long term contracts between producers and their offtake partners, among others. Companies that are increasingly concerned about being socially responsible within their supply chains enter into these contracts to obtain a reliable and clean supply of cobalt. Market perception of price moves in cobalt is often influenced by cobalt futures pricing published by the London Metals Exchange (LME). Because most cobalt supply is tied up in long-term contracts, the relatively small percentage of supply that trades on the LME does not necessarily originate from the highest quality sources, and due to the small size of the market, pricing is susceptible to increased volatility on low trading volume.

Personnel will typically be sourced from nearby towns for general mining labor once that occurs. Experts, such as geologists, engineers, independent consultants and onsite management are typically sourced from major Chilean cities, such as Santiago, or from non-Chilean labor.

COBALTERA 3, 1 to 300 (300 hectares); COBALTERA 4, 1 to 300 (300 hectares); COBALTERA 5, 1 to 264 (264 hectares); COBALTERA 6, 1 to 270 (270 hectares); COBALTERA 7, 1 to 200 (200 hectares); COBALTERA 8, 1 to 269 (269 hectares); COBALTERA 9, 1 to 200 (200 hectares); COBALTERA 10, 1 to 207 (207 hectares); COBALTERA 11, 1 to 200 (200 hectares); COBALTERA 12, 1 to 189 (189 hectares); COBALTERA 13A, 1 to 2 (2 hectares); COBALTERA 13B, 1 to 8 (8 hectares); COBALTERA 13C, 1 to 9 (9 hectares); COBALTERA 13D, 1 to 23 (23 hectares); COBALTERA 13E, 1 to 11 (11 hectares); COBALTERA 13F, 1 to 14 (14 hectares); COBALTERA 14, 1 to 3 (3 hectares); MANUEL TRES [3] 1 to 13 (13 hectares); MANUEL 4 1/60 (60 hectares); SAN RAMON 1 to 10 (93 hectares). In aggregate, the material mining property is 2,635 hectares. To retain the full exploitation status properties described above, Baltum must pay the Chilean Treasury Department annual patent fees (estimated to be approximately $6.30USD per hectare).

The condition of the mining concession areas within the La Cobaltera Project is generally in their natural state, as little to no exploration has yet to be conducted onsite. What has been completed is GeoMagDrone imaging of magnetic field variances (including Total Magnetic Intensity, Magnetic Intensity Reduction to Pole and Magnetic Analytical Signal) in areas that include COBALTERA 13C, COBALTERA 13E, COBALTERA 13F, COBALTERA 14, MANUEL TRES and MANUEL 4 in their entirety and varying portions of COBALTERA 6 (SE Corner, approximately 15 – 20% by area), COBALTERA 8 (South sliver, approximately 5% or less by area), COBALTERA 10 (Eastern half, approximately 40 – 45% by area), COBALTERA 11 (SE Corner, approximately 5% or less by area), COBALTERA 12 (lower ¾, approximately 70 – 75% by area), COBALTERA 13B (Eastern half, approximately 50 – 55% by area), COBALTERA 13D (lower ¾, approximately 75 – 80% by area) and SAN RAMON (NE Corner, approximately 10 – 15% by area). To reiterate, at present this is an exploration-stage material property as are each of the areas outlined previously.
 
The Company exploration program is focused on the continuance of widespread use of any and all non-destructive means of exploration, such as GeoMagDrone, GeoPhysics, Drone surveys, Robotic fieldwork and other non-invasive or less-invasive methods that we can devise or that become available to us through technological advances. Once this preliminary data is obtained, our geologists will use the data to determine the best target sites for core sample drilling in order to maximum the coverage for higher probability areas and achieving overall minimization of the use of drilling while scoping for resources and/or reserves that could lead toward development and production. There are no existing mines in these areas and the proposed program is exploratory in nature. Furthermore, there is no equipment, facilities, mine infrastructure or underground development on this overall material property. The carrying book value of the La Cobaltera Property for accounting purposes is $0. As none of the areas described have been previously developed, there is no history of previous operations on the material property. There are no significant encumbrances to the material property, as exploitation-level mining concessions in Chile have an indefinite life, as long as the annual patent fees are paid each year, as discussed previously. To do any core sample drilling or more invasive development beyond that would require submittal of an Environmental Assessment and Plan of Work for approval. There is no permitting required to perform the type of non-invasive exploration that is outlined earlier in the paragraph with regard to the exploration program.
 
Baltum may be subject to a fine imposed by the National Forestry Corporation of the Atacama Region ("CONAF"), which is currently being negotiated by Baltum’s counsel and CONAF, of up to $4,000, which may be reduced by as much as 50%. This is in connection with a self-report made by Baltum to CONAF on May 13, 2019, reporting the involuntary cutting of certain vegetation species in the La Cobaltera sector. Since Baltum made a self-report to CONAF, the applicable fine may be reduced by as much as 50%. We do not believe that this fine, even if imposed in the full amount, will have any material effect on the Company’s business, financial position or results of operations.
 
Exploration Program Internal Controls
 
There are no internal controls in place at this time with regard to the Company’s exploration program as there are currently no exploration and mineral resource reserve estimation efforts by the Company at this time. As there are presently no mineral resource and reserve estimation efforts on the Company’s material property, related to any of its mining concession areas, there are no applicable internal controls or quality control and quality assurance programs for their estimation in place at this time. However, when it is appropriate to make mineral resource and reserve estimations, the Company intends to engage industry-respected, independent geological consultants to oversee and provide assurance to this process of estimating mineral resources and reserves.
 
COVID-19
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) as a pandemic. Variants of this virus continues to spread throughout the United States and the world. Efforts implemented by local and national governments, as well as businesses, including temporary closures, have had adverse impacts on local, national and global economies. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on C3 operational and financial performance going forward will depend on certain developments, including but not limited to the duration and continued spread of the outbreak and strand mutations, the availability and use of vaccines, the development of therapeutic drugs and treatments, and the direct and indirect impacts on our employees, vendors, and customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be fully anticipated or predicted.

We have experienced material disruptions to our business because of COVID-19. For example, as discussed below, due in part to complications from COVID-19, the inability to raise capital and maintain operations necessitated the decision on the Company’s part to let the installment options to purchase both La Cobaltera and Carrizal Alto lapse in 2020.
 
As such, we can provide no assurance that our operations will not be materially and/or adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the future that could result from any worsening of the pandemic, the effect of mutating strains, additional outbreaks of the pandemic, actions taken to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, continued availability of vaccines, and their distribution, acceptance and efficacy, and governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic including government-imposed regulations regarding, among other things, COVID-19 testing, vaccine mandates and related workplace restrictions.
 
Corporate History
 
On December 4, 2017, Chilean Cobalt Corp. (“C3”) was incorporated in the state of Nevada.
 
On January 3, 2018, C3 formed a direct, wholly-owned Chilean operating subsidiary, named Baltum Mineria SpA (“Baltum”).
 
Founder Shares
 
On December 4, 2017, in connection with the incorporation of C3 on December 4, 2017, C3 issued 11,666,667 shares (pre-reverse split) of common stock at a purchase price of $0.0001 per share (for an aggregate of $1,166.67 of proceeds) to Genlith, Inc. in a private placement under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D of the Securities Act.
Acquisition of Mining Concessions in Northern Chile's Atacama region
 
In January 2018, C3 entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which C3 agreed to sell to investors 5,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”) at $1.00 per share for gross proceeds of $5,000,000. The proceeds from this stock purchase agreement funded the acquisition of mining concessions to develop premier cobalt and copper projects in Northern Chile's Atacama region.

(i) | On January 19, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary Baltum signed a unilateral option contract for the purchase of mining concessions with Sociedad Legal Minera Soledad Uno de la Sierra Arenillas Atlas and Homero Eduardo Callejas Molina.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | On March 16, 2018, the Company’s subsidiary Baltum signed unilateral option contract for the purchase of additional mining concessions with Sociedad Minera Contractual Carrizal Alto.
-----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
However, due to complications from COVID-19 and Chilean Unrest at the end of 2019 and into 2020, the inability to raise capital and maintain operations necessitated the decision to let the installment options to purchase both La Cobaltera and Carrizal Alto lapse in 2020.
 
Land Consolidation Package
 
On April 2, 2019, Baltum entered into a land consolidation package with Cobalta Chile SpA which included mining exploration and exploitation concessions in the La Cobaltera District, Chile. The total consideration paid to Cobalta Chile SpA was $600,000, of which $550,000 went towards acquisition of exploitation and exploration claims, the other $50,000 went towards an option on three additional exploitation claims of which one was eventually purchased on November 6, 2020 for an additional $116,666. Overall acquisition costs paid to Cobalta Chile SpA were $716,666.

Organizational Structure
 
The following is a current organizational chart of our Company:
 




24
--

Employees
 
As of March 24, 2023, we had 3 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. There are no legal proceedings currently pending against us which we believe would have a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no such legal proceedings contemplated or threatened.
 
We may be subject to a fine imposed by the National Forestry Corporation of the Atacama Region ("CONAF"), on our subsidiary Baltum Mineria SpA (“Baltum”), which is currently being negotiated by Baltum’s counsel and CONAF, of up to $4,000, which may be reduced by as much as 50%. This is in connection with a self-report made by Baltum to CONAF on May 13, 2019, reporting the involuntary cutting of certain vegetation species in the La Cobaltera sector. Since Baltum made a self-report to CONAF, the applicable fine may be reduced by as much as 50%. We do not believe that this fine, even if imposed in the full amount, will have any material effect on the Company’s business, financial position or results of operations.
 
Description of Properties
 
Our corporate offices are located at 1199 Lancaster Ave, Suite 107, Berwyn, Pennsylvania 19312. Genlith, Inc. founder of the Company and former shareholder, allows the Company to share this office at no cost by verbal agreement among the two entities.
 
Baltum’s corporate offices are located at Rosario Norte 100, of. 1401, Las Condes, Santiago, Chile. Gestion Ambiental S.A. (“SGA”), an affiliate of Genlith, Inc. and provider of certain accounting and administrative services to Baltum, SGA allows Baltum to use this office for address-purposes and as necessary at no cost by verbal agreement among the two entities.
 
Competition
 
We expect to compete globally against a number of other cobalt and copper producers. Competition is based on several key criteria, including technological capabilities, service, product performance and quality, ESG factors and price. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources. These competitors may also be able to maintain greater operating and financial flexibility. If we fail to compete effectively, we may be unable to retain or expand our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Government and Environmental Regulations 
 
In the ordinary course of business we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for our current limited operations at our projects. We will also need additional governmental permits to accomplish our long-term plans to mine cobalt under plans yet to be developed. Obtaining or renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving costly undertakings by us. The duration and success of our efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority and intervention by third parties in any required environmental review. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary on a timely basis or at all, and the cost to obtain or renew permits may exceed our estimates. Failure to comply with the terms of our permits may result in injunctions, fines, suspension or revocation of permits and other penalties. We can provide no assurance that we have been, or will at all times be, in full compliance with all of the terms of our permits or that we have all required permits. The costs and delays associated with compliance with these permits and with the permitting process could alter all or a portion of any mine plan we may propose in the future, delay or stop us from proceeding with the development of our projects or increase the costs of development or production, any or all of which may materially and/or adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.
 
We are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, employee health and safety, the composition of our planned products, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the usage and availability of water, the cleanup of contaminated properties (including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the U.S., and similar foreign and state laws) and the reclamation of our future mine extraction operations and certain other assets at the end of their useful life. In addition, our future production facilities will require numerous operating permits. Due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our planned operations, we may incur substantial capital and operating costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The Company does not currently have any production facilities in place as these are all in the future planning stages at this time and accordingly, the Company has not yet started the permit process in respect to such planned production facilities.
 
We may also incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws and regulations or permit requirements. In addition, we may be required to either modify existing or obtain new permits to meet our capacity expansion plans. We may be unable to modify or obtain such permits or if we can, it may be costly to do so. Furthermore, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years. Future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could require us to alter our production processes, acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify our planned products or incur other expenses, which could harm our business and results of operations.
 
If we violate environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, in addition to being required to correct such violations, we can be held liable in administrative, civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally. Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities, including, for example, current and prior property owners or operators, as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances.
