ITEM 1.  Description of Business
Company Background
 
General Enterprise Ventures, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated as Ultronics Corporation (the “UC”) under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 14, 1990. UC never had operations and was formed to investigate potential companies that would be interested in merging with it.

(“GEM”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger whereby UAC would be merged into GEM (“Merger”) with GEM to be the surviving corporation. On February 14, 2005, a Certificate of Merger was filed in Delaware; however, there is no evidence of a Certificate of Merger being filed in Nevada. As such, GEM did not cease to exist in Nevada.
 
The acquisition was treated as a reverse merger with GEM deemed to be the accounting acquiror, and UAC the legal acquiror. UAC’s name was changed to General Environmental Management, Inc. (the “Company”) on March 16, 2005.
