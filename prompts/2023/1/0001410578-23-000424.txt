All of them are our key customers. For overseas customers, the Company has supplied power steering gear to Fiat Chrysler North America since 2009 and to Ford Motor Company since 2016.
The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act
Pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspections by the PCAOB for two consecutive years, the SEC will prohibit our shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determination that the PCAOB was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including our auditor. In April 2022, the SEC conclusively listed us as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA following the filing of the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB issued a report that vacated its December 16, 2021 determination and removed mainland China and Hong Kong from the list of jurisdictions where it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms. For this reason, we do not expect to be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer under the HFCAA after we file this annual report on Form 10-K. Each year, the PCAOB will determine whether it can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, among other jurisdictions. If PCAOB determines in the future that it no longer has full access to inspect and investigate completely accounting firms in mainland China and Hong Kong and we continue to use an accounting firm headquartered in one of these jurisdictions to issue an audit report on our financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, we would be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer following the filing of the annual report on Form 10-K for the relevant fiscal year. There can be no assurance that we would not be identified as a Commission-Identified Issuer for any future fiscal year, and if we were so identified for two consecutive years, we would become subject to the prohibition on trading under the HFCAA and our securities may be delisted from Nasdaq as a result. Delisting of our securities would force holders of our securities to sell their securities. Further, we may be prohibited from listing our securities on another U.S. securities exchange. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of such legislative or executive actions upon, as well as negative investor sentiment toward, companies with significant operations in mainland China and Hong Kong that are listed in the United States, regardless of whether such actions are implemented and regardless of our actual operating performance. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related To Doing Business In China And Other Countries Besides The United States—The PCAOB had historically been unable to inspect our auditor in relation to their audit work performed for our financial statements and the inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of our auditor in the past has deprived our investors with the benefits of such inspections.” And “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related To Doing Business In China And Other Countries Besides The United States—Our shares may be prohibited from trading in the United States under the HFCAA in the future if the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely auditors located in China. The delisting of the shares, or the threat of being delisted, may materially and adversely affect the value of your investment.”
Our Corporate Structure
The Company is not a PRC operating company but a Delaware holding company with operations primarily conducted through its wholly owned direct subsidiaries, Genesis and HLUSA, and its several indirect subsidiaries that are either wholly owned or majority owned by either Genesis or HLUSA. Our investors hold shares of common stock in China Automotive, the Delaware holding company.
We do not have or intend to set up any subsidiary or enter into any contractual arrangements to establish a variable interest entity structure with any entity in China.
Our holding company structure presents unique risks as our investors may never directly hold equity interests in our operating subsidiaries and will be dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to finance our cash flow needs. Our ability to receive dividends and other contributions from our subsidiaries are significantly affected by regulations promulgated by Hong Kong and PRC authorities. Any change in the interpretation of existing rules and regulations or the promulgation of new rules and regulations may materially affect our operations and or the value of our securities, including causing the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of the risks facing the Company associated with our structure, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in China and Other Countries Besides the United States.”

Currently, PRC laws and regulations do not prohibit direct foreign investment in our operating subsidiaries. Nonetheless, in light of the recent statements and regulatory actions by the PRC government, such as those related to the promulgation of regulations prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies operating in certain industries, which are constantly evolving, and anti-monopoly concerns, we may be subject to the risks of uncertainty of any future actions of the PRC government in this regard, which would likely result in a material change in our operations, including our ability to continue our existing holding company structure, carry on our current business, accept foreign investments, and offer or continue to offer securities to our investors, and the resulting adverse change in value to our common stock. We may also be subject to penalties and sanctions imposed by the PRC regulatory agencies, including the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, if we fail to comply with such rules and regulations, which would likely adversely affect the ability of the Company’s securities to continue to trade on Nasdaq, which would likely cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless.
As of the date of this report, there is no Chinese Communist Party official who sits on CAAS’ board of directors and CAAS’ certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not contain any charter of the Chinese Communist Party.
Doing Business in China
As a result of our operations in China, the Chinese government may intervene in or exert influence over our operations at any time with little or no advanced notice, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities. For example, the Chinese government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding any industry that could adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of our company.
Furthermore, the Chinese government has also recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over securities offerings and other capital markets activities that are conducted outside of China and over foreign investment in China-based companies. Any such action, once taken by the Chinese government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless. Recently, the Chinese government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China, including enforcement actions against illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed outside of China using the variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. For example, on July 6, 2021, the relevant PRC government authorities made public the Opinions on Intensifying Crack-Down on Illegal Securities Activities. These opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities and the supervision on overseas listings by China-based companies and proposed to take measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies. On November 14, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”) released the draft Administrative Regulations on Cyber Data Security (the “Draft Cyber Data Security Regulations”) for public comments, which requires, among others, that a prior cybersecurity review should be required for listing abroad of data processors which process over one million users’ personal information, and the listing of data processors in Hong Kong which affects or may affect national security.
The Chinese government may further promulgate relevant laws, rules and regulations that may impose additional and significant obligations and liabilities on overseas listed Chinese companies regarding data security, cross-border data flow, anti-monopoly and unfair competition, and compliance with China’s securities laws. It is uncertain whether or how these new laws, rules and regulations and the interpretation and implementation thereof may affect us, but among other things, our ability to obtain external financing through the issuance of equity securities in the United States, Hong Kong or other markets could be negatively affected, and as a result, the trading prices of our securities could significantly decline or become worthless. For a detailed description of risks related to our doing business in China, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related To Doing Business In China And Other Countries Besides The United States.”

Permissions Required from the PRC Authorities for Our Operations
We conduct our business primarily through our subsidiary Genesis, which owns interests in eight Sino-joint ventures and seven wholly owned subsidiaries in the PRC. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. As advised by our PRC counsel, Zhong Lun Law Firm, as of the date of this report, these entities have obtained the requisite licenses and permits from the PRC government authorities that are material for their business operations, including, among others, certain business licenses, approvals for the establishment of enterprises with foreign investment, approvals for overseas direct investment and environmental and occupational safety and health approvals. Given the uncertainties of interpretation and implementation of relevant laws and regulations and the enforcement practice by relevant government authorities, we may be required to obtain additional licenses, permits, filings or approvals for the functions and services of our platform in the future.
On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies, or the Trial Measures, which will come into effect on March 31, 2023. On the same day, the CSRC also published a series of guidance and Q&As in connection with the implementation of the Trial Measures. The Trial Measures established (i) a list outlining the circumstances where a PRC domestic company is prohibited from offering and listing securities overseas (the “Trial Measures Negative List”) and (ii) a new filing-based regime to regulate overseas offerings and listings by PRC domestic companies. According to the Trial Measures, in connection with an overseas offering of securities (including shares, depository receipts, corporate bonds convertible into shares and other equity securities) and listing by a PRC domestic company, either in a direct or indirect manner, the issuer must file certain documents with the CSRC (the “Trial Measures Filing Obligations”). An indirect offering and listing is determined by a set of quantifiable standards. For example, any overseas offering and listing by an issuer that meets both of the following standards will be deemed to be indirect: (i) 50% or more of the issuer’s operating revenue, total profit, total assets or net assets as documented in its audited consolidated financial statements for the most recent accounting year is accounted for by PRC domestic companies, and (ii) the main parts of the issuer’s business activities are conducted in mainland China, or its main places of business are located in mainland China, or the senior managers in charge of its business operation and management are mostly Chinese citizens or domiciled in mainland China.
The Trial Measures provide the CSRC with the authority to warn, fine, and issue injunctions against PRC domestic companies, their controlling shareholders, advisors, and other responsible persons in connection with a listing or offering securities (collectively, the “Subject Entities”), as well as individuals directly responsible for these Subject Entities (the “Subject Individuals”). In cases of serious violation, the relevant responsible persons may be prohibited from entering the securities market1 by the CSRC and may be held criminally liable. For failure to comply with the Trial Measures Negative List or the Trial Measures Filing Obligations, or materially false or misleading statements in the filing and reporting required by the Trial Measures, PRC domestic companies and their controlling shareholders, if the controlling shareholders induced the PRC domestic companies’ failure to comply, severally, may face warnings, injunctions to comply, and fines between RMB 1.0 million and 10.0 million. The Subject Individuals in these entities may severally, face warnings and fines between RMB 0.5 million and 5.0 million. Advisors in listings or offerings of securities that failed to dutifully advise the PRC domestic companies and their controlling shareholders in complying with the Trial Measures and caused such failures to comply can face warnings and fines between RMB 0.5 million and 5.0 million. The Subject Individuals of these advisor entities may, severally, face warnings and fines between RMB 0.2 million and 2.0 million.
Because our shares have already listed on Nasdaq, we believe we will be deemed as an “Existing Issuer” pursuant to the Trial Measures and the implementation guidance and, accordingly, are not required to complete the filing procedures with the CSRC for our historical securities offering. Nevertheless, in the event that we conduct any securities issuance or offering in the future that would be captured by the Trial Measures after they come into effect, we will have to complete the filing procedures with the CSRC within three (3) business days following the closing of thesuch securities issuance or offering.

Therefore, in connection with our business operations and issuance or offering of securities to foreign investors, under currently effective PRC laws, regulations, and rules, and taking the Trial Measures into account, as of the date of this annual report, we and our PRC subsidiaries (i) are not required to obtain permissions from, or complete the filing procedures with, the CSRC for our prior issuances and offerings of securities to foreign investors which were completed before the date of implementation of the Trial Measures, but are required to go through filing procedures with CSRC for our future issuances or offerings of securities (including shares, depository receipts, corporate bonds convertible into shares and other equity securities) to foreign investors if we meet certain conditions set forth in the Trial Measures to be considered as an indirect overseas offering and listing by a PRC domestic company, (ii) are not required to go through cybersecurity review by the CAC for our issuance or offering of securities to foreign investors, and (iii) are not required to obtain any prior permission or approval from any other PRC government authorities for our issuance or offering of securities to foreign investors. If we and our subsidiaries are deemed to be a critical information infrastructure operator, or CIIO, or a network platform operator, whose network product or service purchasing or data processing activities affect or may affect national security, we would be required to go through a cybersecurity review by the CAC. As of the date of this annual report, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries has been identified as a CIIO by any government authority, involved in any investigations or become subject to a cybersecurity review by the CAC based on the Cybersecurity Review Measures. However, there might remain some uncertainty as to how relevant rules published by the PRC government authorities will be interpreted or implemented, and our opinions summarized above are subject to any new laws, rules, and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form. We cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government authorities, including the CSRC and the CAC, would reach the same conclusion and hence, we may face regulatory actions or other sanctions from them. For more details, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Doing Business in China — The PRC government has significant oversight over the conduct of the business of our PRC subsidiaries; such oversight could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of our securities or could significantly limit our ability to offer or continue to offer securities and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline.” and “Item 1A - Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Doing Business in China—The approval of and filing with the CSRC or other PRC government authorities may be required in connection with our offshore offerings under PRC law, and, if required, we cannot predict whether or for how long we will be able to obtain such approval or complete such filing.”
Cash Flows through Our Organization
China Automotive is a holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations in China primarily through our subsidiaries, particularly Genesis, which owns interests in eight Sino-joint ventures and seven wholly owned subsidiaries in the PRC. As a result, although other means are available for us to obtain financing at the holding company level, China Automotive’s ability to pay dividends to the shareholders and to service any debt it may incur may depend upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries. If any of our subsidiaries incurs debt on its own behalf, the instruments governing such debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends to China Automotive. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to China Automotive only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Further, our PRC subsidiaries are required to make appropriations to certain statutory reserve funds, which are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of a solvent liquidation of the companies.
We may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders or to service any debt we may incur. If any of our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a certain statutory reserve fund, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Such reserve funds cannot be distributed to us as dividends. At its discretion, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to an enterprise expansion fund, or a staff welfare and bonus fund. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal in the PRC, up to the amount of net assets held in each operating subsidiary. The amounts restricted include the paid-up capital and the statutory reserve funds of our PRC subsidiaries, totaling RMB 465.9 million, RMB 499.8 million, RMB 504.7 million and RMB 508.8 million as of December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.
Under PRC law, China Automotive may provide funding to its PRC subsidiaries only through capital contributions or loans.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company received loans which were interest free from its subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of $4.3 million, $6.6 million, $2.5 million and $6.1 million, respectively, and no principal was repaid in such years.
Although the Company announced a special cash dividend of $0.18 per common share to the Company’s shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 26, 2014, it does not anticipate paying any other cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company currently intends to retain future earnings, if any, to finance operations and the expansion of its business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors and will be based upon the Company’s financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, plans for expansion, restrictions imposed by any financing arrangements and any other factors that the Company’s board of directors deems relevant.

In December 2009, the Company, through Henglong, formed Testing Center and cooperated with Nanyang Ind. Co. Ltd. and Tsinghua University to engage in the research and development of new products, such as Electric Power Steering (“EPS”), integral rack and pinion power steering and high pressure power steering, to optimize current products design and to develop new, cost-saving manufacturing processes. In January 2015, Hubei Henglong formed Shanghai Henglong, which mainly engages in the design and sale of automotive electronics, to capture the market opportunities for EPS, which were included in traditional hydraulic power steering products by many automobile makers. In November 2017, Hubei Henglong formed Jingzhou Qingyan Intelligent Automotive Technology Research Institute Co., Ltd.(“Jingzhou Qingyan”), which mainly engages in the research and development of intelligent automotive technology. In August 2018, Hubei Henglong established a non-wholly owned subsidiary, Hubei Henglong KYB Automobile Electric Steering System Co., Ltd., which mainly engages in design, manufacture, sales and after-sales service of automobile electronic systems. In March 2019, Hubei Henglong established a non-wholly owned subsidiary, Hyoseong (Wuhan) Motion Mechatronics System Co., Ltd., which mainly engages in the design, manufacture and sales of automotive motors and electromechanical integrated systems. In December 2019, Hubei Henglong formed Wuhu Hongrun New Material Co., Ltd. (“Wuhu Hongrun”), which mainly engages in the development, manufacturing and sale of high polymer materials. In April 2020, Hubei Henglong acquired 100.0% of the equity interests of Changchun Hualong Automotive Technology Co. Ltd., “Changchun Hualong”, which mainly engages in design and R&D of automotive parts. In April 2021, Hubei Henlgong acquired 100.0% of the equity interests of Wuhu Henglong Automotive Steering Systems Co., Ltd., “Wuhu”, which mainly engages in the production and sales of automobile steering systems. Jingzhou Qingyan deregistered from the local business administration on June 22, 2022.

--+------------------------------------------------

CUSTOMERS
The Company’s five largest customers represented 42.8% of the Company’s total sales for the year ended December 31, 2022. The following table sets forth information regarding the Company’s five largest customers.
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​
----------------------------+---+---------------------+--
​ | | Percentage of Total | 
Name of Major Customers | | Revenue in 2022 | 
Fiat Chrysler North America | | 20.2 | %
Hubei Hongrun | | 6.2 | %
Great Wall Motors | | 5.9 | %
BYD Auto Co., Ltd., | | 5.3 | %
Chery Automobile Co.,Ltd. | | 5.2 | %
Total | | 42.8 | %

​
The Company primarily sells its products to the above-mentioned customers, which, except for Hubei Hongrun, are original equipment manufacturing, “OEM”, customers; it also has excellent relationships with them, including serving as their first-rank supplier and developer for product development for new models. While the Company intends to continue to focus on retaining and winning this business, it cannot ensure that it will succeed in doing so. It is difficult to keep doing business with the above mentioned OEM customers as a result of severe price competition and customers’ diversification of their supply base. The Company’s business would be materially and adversely affected if it loses one or more of these major customers.
SALES AND MARKETING
The Company’s sales and marketing team has 98 sales persons, which are divided into an OEM team, a sales service team and a working group dedicated to international business. These sales and marketing teams provide a constant interface with the Company’s key customers. They are located in all major vehicle producing regions to more effectively represent the Company’s customers’ interests within the Company’s organization, to promote their programs and to coordinate their strategies with the goal of enhancing overall service and satisfaction. The Company’s ability to support its customers is further enhanced by its broad presence in terms of sales offices, manufacturing facilities, engineering technology centers and joint ventures.
The Company’s sales and marketing organization and activities are designed to create overall awareness and consideration of, and therefore to increased sales of the Company’s modular systems and components. To achieve that objective, the Company organized delegations to visit the United States, Korea, India and Japan and has supplied power steering gear to Fiat Chrysler North America (“Fiat”). Through these activities, the Company has generated potential business interest as a strong base for future development.
DISTRIBUTION
The Company’s distribution system covers all of China. The Company has established sales and service offices with certain significant customers to deal with matters related to such customers in a timely fashion. The Company also established distribution warehouses close to major customers to ensure timely deliveries. The Company maintains strict control over inventories. Each of these sales and service offices sends back to the Company, through e-mail or fax, information related to the inventory and customers’ needs. The Company guarantees product delivery in 8 hours for those customers who are located within 200 km from the Company’s distribution

warehouses, and 24 hours for customers who are located outside of 200 km from the Company’s distribution warehouses. Delivery time is a very important competitive factor in terms of customer decision making, together with quality, pricing and long-term relationships. The Company has two distribution warehouses in the United States, which are located in Michigan and Texas, respectively. The warehouses deliver parts to customers every day.
EMPLOYEES AND FACILITIES
As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 4,093 persons, including approximately:

● | 1,139 by Henglong (including Testing Center formed by Henglong);

--+--------------------------

As of December 31, 2022, Henglong, Jiulong, Shenyang, Chongqing, Wuhan Chuguanjie, Hubei Henglong and Wuhu had a manufacturing and administration area of 111,211 square meters, 39,478 square meters, 35,354 square meters, 57,849 square meters, 53,675 square meters, 277,269 square meters and 83,705 square meters, respectively.
Hubei Province, which is home to Dongfeng, one of the largest automakers in China, provides an ample supply of inexpensive but skilled labor to automotive-related industries. The annual production of one of the Company’s main products, power steering gears, was approximately 8.1 million units and 7.8 million units in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Although the production process continues to rely heavily on manual labor, the Company has invested substantially in high-level production machinery to improve capacity and production quality. Approximately $53.7 million was spent over the last three years to purchase professional-grade equipment and extend workshops.
RAW MATERIALS
The Company purchases various manufactured components and raw materials for use in its manufacturing processes. The principal components and raw materials the Company purchases include castings, finished sub-components, aluminum, steel, fabricated metal electronic parts and molded plastic parts. The most important raw material is steel. The Company enters into purchase agreements with local suppliers. The annual purchase plans are determined at the beginning of the calendar year but are subject to revision every three months as a result of customers’ orders. A purchase order is made according to monthly production plans. This protects the Company from building up inventory when the orders from customers change.
The Company’s purchases from its ten largest suppliers represented in the aggregate 24.8% of all components and raw materials it purchased for the year ended December 31, 2022, and none of them provided more than 10% of total purchases.
All components and raw materials are available from numerous sources. The Company has not, in recent years, experienced any significant shortages of manufactured components or raw materials and normally does not carry inventories of these items in excess of what is reasonably required to meet its production and shipping schedules.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Company owns the Testing Center, a Hubei Provincial-Level technical center, which has been approved by the Hubei Economic Commission. The center has a staff of about 227, including 94 engineers, primarily focusing on steering system R&D, tests, production process improvement and new material and production methodology application.
In addition, the Company has formed Shanghai Henglong to engage in the design and sale of automotive electronics, including key parts of EPS.
The Company believes that its engineering and technical expertise, together with its emphasis on continuing research and development, allow it to use the latest technologies, materials and processes to solve problems for its customers and to bring new, innovative products to market. The Company believes that continued research and development activities, including engineering, are critical to maintaining its pipeline of technologically advanced products. The Company has aggressively managed costs in other portions of its business in order to increase its total expenditures for research and development activities, including engineering, at approximately $36.1 million and $28.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In 2022 and 2021, the sales of such newly developed products accounted for about 29.5% and 23.2%, respectively, of total sales.
COMPETITION
The automotive components industry is extremely competitive. The Company’s customers consider criteria including quality, price/cost competitiveness, system and product performance, reliability and timeliness of delivery, new product and technology development capability, excellence and flexibility in operations, degree of global and local presence, effectiveness of customer service and overall management capability. The power steering system market is fragmented in China, and the Company has seven major competitors. Of these competitors, two are Sino-foreign joint ventures while the other five are state-owned. Like many competitive industries, there is pressure on downward selling prices.
The Company’s major competitors, including Shanghai ZF, Nexteer and First Auto FKS, “FKS,” are component suppliers to specific automobile manufacturers. Shanghai ZF is the joint venture of SAIC and ZF Germany, which is an exclusive supplier to SAIC-Volkswagen and SAIC-GM. FKS is a joint venture between First Auto Group and Japan’s Koyo Company and its main customer is FAW-Volkswagen Company.
While the Chinese government limits foreign ownership of auto assemblers to 50%, there is no analogous limitation in the automotive components industry. Thus, opportunities exist for foreign component suppliers to set up factories in China. These overseas competitors employ technology that may be more advanced and may have existing relationships with global automobile assemblers, but they are generally not as competitive as the Company in China in terms of production cost and flexibility in meeting client requirements.
CHINESE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY
The Company is a supplier of automotive parts and most of its operations are located in China. An increase or decrease in the output and sales of Chinese vehicles could result in an increase or decrease of the Company’s results of operations. According to the latest statistics from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, “CAAM”, the output and sales volume of passenger vehicles in 2022 was 23.8 million and 23.6 million units respectively, an increase of 11.2% and 9.5%, respectively, compared to 2021. The output and sales volume of commercial vehicles in 2022 was 3.2 million and 3.3 million units, respectively, a decrease of 31.9% and 31.2%, 

14 | Page



respectively, compared to 2021. In 2022, the Company’s sales of steering gears for passenger vehicles increased by 15.6% and the sales of steering gears for commercial vehicles decreased by 26.1%, compared to 2021 in China.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
The Company is subject to the requirements of U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S., including China’s, environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge and waste management. The Company has an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support its compliance with these requirements globally. Although the Company intends to comply with all such requirements and regulations, it cannot provide assurance that it is at all times in compliance. The Company has made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements, although such expenditures were not material during the past two years. Environmental requirements are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that its eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not be material.
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not make any material capital expenditures relating to environmental compliance.
