ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Our Company
Interlink Electronics, Inc. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Interlink” or the “Company”) operates in two principal divisions: force-sensing resistors/Human Machine Interface (“HMI”) technology and gas-sensing technology. 
Force-Sensing Resistors. We design, develop, manufacture and sell a range of force-sensing technologies that incorporate our proprietary materials technology, firmware and software into a portfolio of standard products and custom solutions. These include sensor components, subassemblies, modules and products that support effective, efficient cursor control and novel three-dimensional user inputs. Our Human Machine Interface (“HMI”) technology platforms are deployed in a wide range of markets including consumer electronics, automotive, industrial, and medical. The application of our HMI technology platforms includes vehicle entry, vehicle multi-media control interface, rugged touch controls, presence detection, collision detection, speed and torque controls, pressure mapping, biological monitoring and others.
Interlink has been a leader in the printed electronics industry for over 35 years with the commercialization of our patented Force-Sensing Resistor (“FSR®”) technology that has enabled rugged and reliable HMI solutions. Our solutions have focused on handheld user input, menu navigation, cursor control, and other intuitive interface technologies for the world’s top electronics manufacturers.
We invented FSR® technology and pioneered commercialization of printed electronics manufacturing, paving the way for industry-wide adoption of force-sensing technology. Our extensive knowledge and experience with this technology, along with the firmware we incorporate in our HMI solutions, differentiates us from other providers of HMI solutions. We, along with our customers, incorporate our FSR® and force-sensing sensors and modules into end-user products. Our sensors and modules are used in electronics devices and systems where user input must be converted into useful output data. Our force-sensing technology solution platforms enable industry-first implementations in gaming, smartphone, rugged notebook, automotive cockpit and automotive entry applications. Consumer and end-user demand for enhanced user experience is driving the need for innovative multi-modal HMI technologies and applications. Force-sensing input provides a critical novel modality that drives a paradigm shift in HMI.
The market is increasingly requiring innovative solutions that enable smaller, thinner devices, lower power consumption, highly refined designs, better navigation and more intuitive usability in all environments, which is driving increased demand for our products. High-tech products are moving towards the use of multi-modal HMI in the home, industrial, medical and automotive spaces. Interlink delivers cutting edge, high performance HMI solutions for customers who wish to replace outdated switches and knobs in these environments.
Significant market opportunities are rapidly emerging for us to improve upon the functionality of standard capacitive sensors which are widely available and competitively priced. Inadvertent activation, where users unintentionally activate a control, is a common problem with capacitive technology. In contrast, force-sensing solutions require a deliberate application of force to operate. We have had success in using our force-sensing solutions in combination with capacitive technologies to minimize the latter’s performance issues, enabling force-sensing solutions to complement competitive technologies and provide hybrid solutions and open up new opportunities for growth. We continue to simultaneously expand our standard product portfolio and develop new technology platforms to grow existing markets and capture emerging markets. This portfolio expansion will incorporate other complimentary sensing technologies. This broader portfolio of technologies will allow us to use our expertise in integrating multiple sensing technologies for applications in the rapidly growing Internet-of-Things (“IoT”).
Gas-Sensing Technology. We entered the gas-sensing market through our acquisition in December 2022 of the business assets of SPEC Sensors, LLC (“SPEC”) and KWJ Engineering, Inc. (“KWJ”), early pioneers in miniaturized, low-cost gas-sensing technologies, for approximately $2.2 million. Through these divisions (collectively, “SPEC-KWJ”), we now offer electrochemical gas-sensing technology products and solutions for industry, community, health and home, with uses in fields such as carbon monoxide and ozone detection and air quality monitoring.

Our SPEC-KWJ division operates three primary business activities:

● | Custom Design and Engineering. For customers requiring specialized design and engineering work on new products incorporating gas-sensing, we offer circuit design and optimization, advanced characterization and compensation, development of operating firmware and algorithms, enclosure design and implementation, and testing and calibration. Examples include the world’s first carbon monoxide shutoff for portable generators and a rapid transdermal alcohol detector that can serve as a barrier to starting a vehicle while intoxicated. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SBIR Awards. We have been successful in obtaining Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grants from government agencies such as the NIH, the USDA, the NSF and the EPA that have enabled us to conduct research and development and develop new products. For example, SPEC’s Screen Printed Electrochemical Sensor technology was developed in part under NSF Phase I, II and IIB grants. Recent SBIR-funded projects include wildland fire air pollution monitoring and firefighter safety devices, transdermal blood alcohol monitors, and a simple lead test for drinking water safety.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Proprietary Product Lines. We offer our own line of instruments including Eco Sensors ozone monitors, an inline monitor for CO and other gases, a low-pressure alarm to notify users when tanks for life-critical gases such as oxygen and nitrogen need to be replenished, and sensor modules for air quality monitoring in “smart city” projects and IoT applications. Additionally, we provide a line of electrochemical sensors that are suited for wearable technology.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The market for gas sensors is growing rapidly, driven by demand in a broad range of industries and the availability of smaller, lower-cost, connected sensors. On a worldwide basis, green initiatives and accompanying government mandates are driving demand for facilities monitoring, especially in the energy space where regulations targeting fugitive gas emissions will require expanded detection efforts. Additionally, government and consumer demand for air quality information and pollution monitoring represent a significant opportunity for high performance, low-cost sensors and IoT devices as part of smart cities and smart homes. New applications in breath analysis and transdermal detection are also expected to create new opportunities in medical, commercial and consumer markets. Traditional safety and environmental monitoring markets are expected to grow with the reduction in size and cost of sensors and instruments, leading to larget networks of gas sensors improving the safety and performance of infrastructure. We believe we are positioned to take advantage of these trends with our proprietary, low-cost, low-power gas-sensing technologies and deep domain expertise in instrument design and implementation.

Our Industry
Force-Sensing and HMI. HMI technologies have been available since the early 1970’s but were used almost exclusively in industrial products during the first 20 years of their existence. The introduction of touchpad mouse devices for laptop computers in the early 1990’s represented the first significant transition of HMI technologies into the consumer electronics market. Personal devices utilizing touch-sensitive technology became ubiquitous in our daily human-machine interactions with the introduction in 2007 of smart phone technology incorporating capacitive touchscreens. As the smart phone became an integral part of consumers’ daily lives throughout the world, it influenced consumers’ expectations of how we should interact with all types of devices. Whether those devices are personal electronics, industrial and medical equipment, or automobiles, users of this equipment expect sleek, highly-functioning design including touch-sensing technology. Consumers no longer want to push buttons or flip switches; rather, they expect smooth touch pads and gesture-driven input. Engineers are responding to this demand by incorporating touch-sensitive technology into a wide range of products, and any device that can utilize force and position sensing inputs to control or enhance its functionality is a candidate for use of the technology.
The products and solutions that we design, develop and manufacture for HMI and IoT applications are primarily printed electronic products. Printed electronics is an additive manufacturing technology used to create electrical devices on various substrates. For over 35 years we have honed and developed the processes necessary to manufacture high quality printed electronic products for HMI applications. Printed electronic technologies are emerging as potential low-cost replacements to silicon-based electronics in many specific application areas. As reported by industry analyst group IDTechEx, printed force sensors alone already account for approximately 30% of printed sensor market share, and by 2025, the projected market for all printed sensor components is expected to surpass $8 billion. According to the IDTechEx study Printed, Organic and Flexible Electronics 2020-2030: Forecasts, Technologies, Markets, the total market for printed, flexible, and organic electronics will grow from $41.2 billion in 2020 to $74 billion in 2030. The majority of that is OLEDs (organic but not printed) and conductive ink used for a wide range of applications; however, stretchable electronics, logic and memory, thin film sensors have huge growth potential. As a member of OE-A, the Organic and Printed Electronics Association, we actively influence and contribute to the global landscape of printed electronics.
IoT-enabled intelligent sensing applications are gaining rapid commercial attention. Our sensing technology platforms are capable of providing the critical backbone for data sensing, measurement and analytics used in emerging wireless connectivity implementations in both short-range low-power wireless communications such as Bluetooth and long-range ultra low-power wireless communications such as LoRaWAN®.
Gas-Sensing Technology. The modern era of gas detection started in the 1920s with the development of the catalytic combustion sensor by Dr. Oliver Johnson, the father of KWJ’s namesake Ken Johnson. Dr. Johnson also started what is widely recognized as the first electronics company in Silicon Valley, J-W Instruments, to commercialize the technology. The market has consistently demanded innovations making gas sensors smaller and more portable, and KWJ-SPEC and its predecessors have been on the forefront; for example, KWJ’s SPARROW stands out in today’s marketplace as the world’s smallest Bluetooth low energy (“BLE”)-enabled carbon monoxide monitor. Similarly, Dr. Jospeh Stetter, the inventor of SPEC’s Screen Printed Electrochemical Sensor technology, was one of the first to design and build commercial electrochemical gas sensors, and today SPEC delivers one of the smallest electrochemical gas sensors on the market. 
The gas-detection industry has traditionally revolved around safety applications in hazardous environments, from oil and gas facilities to coal mines and other confined spaces where toxic and combustible gases could cause catastrophic losses. Over time, devices became smaller and more portable, reflecting the need for better solutions to improve health and safety in the workplace, but for many years, gas-sensor technology lagged begind. Most sensors used today are still relatively large or expensive or require too much power to operate to enable new applications in the field. SPEC’s screen-printed sensors offer an alternative using proven electrochemical techniques with new materials and manufacturing techniques to produce sensors that offer high performance but at low cost and with a small footprint. 
Today, the demand for gas sensors has expanded beyond traditional applications with new industries requiring solutions from breath analysis to food transport and storage to wearable monitors for air quality and transdermal detection. Government and consumers are looking for information about their environment as the negative impact of global pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions, has become apparent. Gas sensors are a core element of many IoT applications and a critical part of the vision of a sensor-driven society where new technologies enable improved monitoring to enhance lives and protect the planet. We see SPEC’s printed sensor technology as a pathway to ubiquitous environmental sensing where low-power, low-cost sensors can provide a hyper-local picture of the air we breathe everyday, not just for those in industrial settings.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our product development teams are skilled in concept definition, rapid prototyping, hardware and firmware development and integration support. Interlink benefits from its own world-class manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China, and its advanced and proprietary KWJ-SPEC facility in Silicon Valley, allowing us to react quickly to customer needs while ensuring the highest quality standards. We also maintain a technical sales force that can address new and existing customer opportunities worldwide. Our teams engage early in the development phase with our customers and we provide critical design inputs to ensure the solutions developed address the customer’s needs and meet their design goals and intent. We strive to solve our customers’ problems.
Our Technology Platforms and Products
Force-Sensing Technology and HMI. Interlink was founded on the invention and commercialization of FSR® technology, the industry’s first force-sensing solution using printed electronics manufacturing. As we transition from an FSR® sensor supplier to an HMI solutions provider, we pursue and embrace leading edge force-sensing and related technology platforms. Our embedded software engineering team located in Singapore, along with our VP of Engineering & Advanced Materials and our expanding materials science and engineering team in Camarillo, California, are focused on strategic technology roadmaps, development of scalable technology platform architectures and pursuit of synergistic technology partnerships. We also expect to launch an engineering, research and development center in the United Kingdom. In an ever-changing and competitive landscape, we are committed to staying ahead of the technology curve.
The two primary types of user-input technologies common in today’s devices are capacitive and resistive. Capacitive sensors are used in the touch screens found in most smart phones and similar devices used globally by millions of consumers. The most significant drawback to the capacitive technology is its inability to measure force, although there has been some progress recently in enhancing the technology with pseudo force-sensing. Capacitive sensors have become a high-volume, low-margin commodity product.
Our patented FSR® sensor technology consists of a bottom layer of conductor electrodes, a proprietary resistive material top layer and a separator between the two layers. An additional top layer that contains graphics and protects the sensor can also be added. FSR® sensors can be as thin as eight thousandths of an inch, making them particularly well suited for use where the design space is restricted, as in portable or wearable electronics. Our force-sensing technology enables the sensor to be used for continuously variable control functions. For example, in a pointing device, increased pressure can be used to produce faster cursor movement. Unlike

capacitive devices, an FSR® sensor’s performance is not impeded by the presence of moisture, dirt or dust, making the sensor suitable for use outdoors and in moist and other “hostile” environments. Our FSR® sensors have no moving parts, can be packaged in a sealed environment, and are lower power and less susceptible to false readings or unintended touches than capacitive sensors. We have developed sophisticated algorithms and firmware that allows our FSR® technology to become a complete solution delivering effective HMI functionality to our customers.
Custom Solutions. Interlink offers a comprehensive portfolio of standard solutions, from simple force sensors to multi-finger capable rugged trackpads. The largest part of our business, however, is the development and manufacture of custom solutions for our major customers. We offer full integration capability spanning initial concept to large volume manufacturing. Custom solutions can be a single- or multi-technology platform to meet customer requirements and include both input and output technologies. We also offer full embedded firmware development and integration support. In many instances we work very closely with our OEM partners from the concept phase to ensure that our solutions are successfully integrated.
Standard Solutions. Our portfolio of standard solutions includes:

● | Our standard single zone FSR® sensors are the most versatile force-sensing technology on the market today. These innovative sensors provide an inverse change in resistance in response to an increase or decrease in applied force. These provide engineers and designers with a durable, reliable, easy to measure, easy to integrate, thin-form factor and low-cost solution for HMI touch solutions and analog data capture for machines. FSR® sensors are available in a range of sizes, shapes and lengths and with several connection options. We also now offer them in different force-sensing ranges, with the introduction of our FSR X® and FSR UX® range of standard sensors. These new sensors were developed in our material science development lab.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Force-sensing linear potentiometers (“FSLP”) are sensors which can be used for menu navigation and control. Our use of force allows for high rate scrolling and a more intuitive user experience. The FSLP is an easy to integrate, high resolution, ultra-low-power based solution that brings intuitive user controls to reduced form factor hand-held consumer electronic devices. These sensors are available in multiple lengths. We also offer a ring sensor for full 360-degree position sensing. These sensors are designed to be integrated into a device’s host processor without the need for a dedicated microprocessor.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our integrated mouse modules and pointing solutions can add touchpad or 360-degree pointing control to virtually any electronic device. Ranging from simple mouse button integration to NEMA rated (National Electrical Manufacturer Association) industrial pointing devices, these solutions are ideal for applications away from the desktop. The modules use FSR® technology and measurement firmware in a four-zone sensor or 4-wire resistive touchpad configuration along with a micro-controller to provide pressure sensitive cursor direction and speed control in a durable and easy to integrate form factor.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Piezoelectric sensors are an upcoming addition to our standard sensor portfolio. After highly successful custom implementation in automotive applications, we have developed a set of standard piezo sensors and development kit. These sensors are polymeric piezoelectric sensors with a wide range of applications and uses such as dynamic strain gauges, impact/force sensors, vital signs sensors, motion sensors, vibration sensors, accelerometers, and solid state rugged switches. Many of these diverse application modes require extensive domain knowledge for successful integration. We believe our expertise in this area will allow us to be a trusted advisor to help our customers develop specialized solutions and solve their integration challenges.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gas-sensor technologies are diverse and fragmented with devices and sensors focused on specific solitions and applications. Electrochemical gas sensors are typically more sensitive and selective to particular gases and are inherently low power to operate. They are also typically very large, expensive and prone to short lifespans in the field. SPEC Sensors was created to address the growing market demand for smaller, lower cost, high performance electrochemical sensors for wireless, wearable and IoT applications, and we now combine proven electrochemical sensor technology with new materials and manufacturing methods to produce some of the smallest, thinnest, lowest cost gas sensors still capable of performing in demanding applications. 
Our electrochemical gas-sensing technology products and solutions combine our innovations with custom electronics, calibration and compensation to deliver unique solutions and address needs in industry, community, health and home settings, with uses in fields such as carbon monoxide and ozone detection and air quality monitoring.

● | Our Eco Sensors™ branded line of ozone monitors and detectors is the low-cost market leader in the space, incorporating state-of-the-art SPEC sensors to achieve reference-level accuracy at a low cost. Ozone is commonly used in a wide variety of commercial applications to clean, disinfect and remediate odors without the use of environmentally harmful chemicals. Ozone is a powerful oxidant that can be produced on site and dissipates into oxygen after reaction or its end of half-life. However, ozone is toxic to humans and can destroy materials at higher concentrations and therefore needs to be monitored during use for safety and process control. Under the Eco Sensors brand, we offer a full line of ozone instruments, including low cost handhelds, wall mount alarms, remote generator controllers and OEM modules.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We offer a number of standard and custom solutions for in-line carbon monoxide monitoring for supplied breathing air applications. Designed to meet the requirements of OSHA monitoring for CO in compressed gas lines and carrying CSA approval, our CO monitors offer a robust and reliable solution for medical gas verification and demanding supplied air applications such as sandblasting and painting. We also make low-pressure cylinder alarms and the world’s smallest Bluetooth CO monitor, the SPARROW.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our line of screen-printed electrochemical gas sensors offer high performance and a unique, small form factor at a low price. Our UL-2034 recognized CO sensor offers air quality level sensitivity with an industry-leading 10-year lifetime. Additionally, we offer sensors for H2S, Ozone, NO2, SO2, Ethanol and VOC’s, as well as new sensors for hydrogen and low-level outdoor CO. We also sell gas-sensor modules that incorporate operating electronics and signal processing to deliver compensated PPM output off the shelf.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
We believe that intellectual property protection is crucial to our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, nondisclosure agreements with employees and third parties, licensing and other contractual agreements with third parties to protect our intellectual property. We maintain and support an active program to protect our intellectual property primarily through the filing of patent applications and the defense of issued patents against infringement. We are not currently engaged in any patent infringement suits. We implement a ring-fencing strategy of patenting core technology platforms related to sensors, sensing systems and human interface devices. This strategy is designed to provide a strong barrier against competition in our core sensor technologies while ensuring competitive advantages in applications of sensing systems and human machine interface devices in the event a competitor successfully circumvents the core sensor patents.
Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property rights for any reason could hurt our competitive position. There is no guarantee that patents will be issued from the patent applications that we have filed or may file. Our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and claims of our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength, or issued in the proper geographic regions, to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with patents and intellectual property.
Our FSR® sensors are manufactured using proprietary screen-printing techniques. All proprietary aspects of the manufacturing process are currently conducted in-house at our U.S. and China manufacturing facilities to maintain quality and protect our force-sensing technology from infringement. While screen-printing is a common process in various industries, the quality and precision of printing, as well as the specific processes required to make high-quality FSR® sensors, require considerable domain knowledge expertise and know how. We believe this expertise is difficult to replicate over the short term and, to our knowledge, no unrelated party has done so. As a result, we consider this expertise to be one of our more important trade secrets. We require our employees to sign nondisclosure agreements and seek to limit access to sensitive information to the greatest practical extent.

As of December 31, 2022, we held twenty-four (24) patents, and had sixteen (16) patents pending. We group our patents into three general categories: sensors, which includes eight (8) patents expiring between 2024 and 2032; sensing systems, which includes five (5) patents expiring between 2029 and 2038; and human interface devices, which includes eleven (11) patents expiring between 2024 and 2036. Our intellectual property strategy involves filing patent applications in our strategic focus markets on a regular basis. We have also strengthened our patent portfolio to align with rapidly emerging market opportunities in IoT and smart surfaces. Our sensor fusion platform portfolio, for example, enables strategic pre-positioning in capturing intelligent multi-sensing applications including, for example, haptics. This will be enabled by emerging ultra low-power wireless technologies including WiFi, BLE, LoRaWAN®, as well as cellular technologies such as LTE-M and NB-IoT.
Competition
The markets for our products, both in force-sensing/HMI and gas-sensing, are highly competitive and subject to rapid advancement in design technology. We must identify and capture future market opportunities by developing and deploying value-added products.
We compete for market share based on our customers’ selection of our components over our competitors during the design phase of their products. Our ability to compete is dependent on the needs of our customers, how well our products address those needs, our corporate relationships, and a variety of other factors.
In force-sensing/HMI, we offer a disruptive technology that is replacing outdated and undesirable approaches including switch technology. We often must convince companies to abandon older, proven but less elegant technologies and adopt our solutions. This change is supported by significant end-user demand for touch-sensitive solutions. We also compete against the highly commoditized capacitive sensing technology. However, our solutions are focused on providing functionality in situations where capacitive is not the appropriate solution, is unreliable or entirely unavailable. Our hybrid sensor fusion solutions better address our customers’ unique sensing and HMI challenges.
In gas-sensing, we offer sensors that are smaller, thinner, and lower cost than most competitors that offer sensors in commoditized packages and pinouts. We are also capable of rapid customization of our sensors to meet the specific detection needs of our OEM customers, giving us an advantage in new and difficult applications and providing a better solution overall. We also combine our sensors with custom electronics, calibration and compensation to enhance performance and provide plug-and-play solutions that reduce the customer’s need to invest in calibration infrastructure. We maintain a market advantage in ozone sensing through our deep industry knowledge and advanced calibration and compensation. Our in-line CO monitors remain the industry standard for reliability and can garner a premium over lower cost, lower quality competitors. We believe that adding features such as connectivity and portability will enhance our offering and maintain our advantage in the future.
The markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition and we anticipate that our products will continue to face substantial pricing pressure. We believe that our strategy of developing and offering more sophisticated solutions, including smart surfaces for HMI applications and connected, cost-effective gas detection instruments, will enable us to maintain our leading edge over our competitors.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our products and solutions through our direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives and distributors. We work directly with large multi-national companies, small start-up companies, technology design houses and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). Our sales personnel have extensive engineering backgrounds and receive substantial support from our internal engineering resources. Sales frequently result from interactions between senior management, design engineers, procurement departments, and our sales personnel. We interact with our customers throughout the product development and order process. We maintain sales offices in the United States and Japan. We primarily utilize Digi-Key Electronics, based in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, as a global, full-service distributor of our standard products. In addition to Digi-Key Electronics, we distribute gas-detection instruments through Grainger, Cole Parmer and other worldwide distributors, and we have representative companies located in key markets so we can provide local support to strategic customers in these regions.

Our customers generally do not provide us with firm, long-term volume purchase commitments, opting instead to issue purchase orders that they can cancel, reduce, or delay at any time. In order to meet the expectations of our customers, we must provide innovative solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. This requires us to match our design and production capacity with customer demand, manage inventory, maintain satisfactory delivery schedules, and meet performance goals.
Our customer base is widely dispersed geographically. Sales to customers located outside the United States have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues, and we expect this to continue. On a bill-to basis, international sales constituted 55% and 71% of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, with sales in 2022 to customers in Japan, China, and Taiwan accounting for 24%, 15%, and 6% of net revenues, respectively.
Future sales of our products will be based on, among other elements, expansion into adjacent markets, continued expansion of our product line, the acceptance of our product line, expansion into additional domestic and international markets, and our ability to maintain a competitive position against other technology providers.
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had three customers that represented 24.9%, 17.8% and 9.3% of net revenues, respectively, and have been customers of ours for over 30 years, over 10 years, and over 10 years, respectively. These same three customers represented 14.7%, 9.4%, and 14.7% of net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Manufacturing Operations and Principal Suppliers
We have our own modern manufacturing facility of approximately 14,476 square feet in Shenzhen, China that is ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 13485 certified. We plan to start the process of acquiring IATF 16949 certification as our automotive customer base expands. We work hard to meet current environmental and sustainability standards required by our customers and legislation in various geographic markets. All products are RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) and REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) compliant. We also monitor all of our suppliers to ensure that conflict minerals are eliminated from our supply chain.
We purchase our materials from outside suppliers. We carefully select suppliers based on their ability to provide quality parts and components that meet technical specifications. We actively monitor these suppliers, but we are subject to substantial risks associated with the performance of our suppliers. We source certain of our components from single-suppliers, including multinational conglomerates Henkel, DuPont, Solvay, SABIC and 3M, which increases the risk of shortages and shipment delays and decreases our ability to negotiate with that supplier. Many of our products are subject to qualification testing and approval by our customers, which includes approval of the materials used in a customer’s product. These single-source materials, however, are available from other suppliers, and while their procurement from other sources likely would necessitate additional approvals from our customers and might result in short-term disruption to our business, we do have options to purchase single-sourced materials from alternative suppliers should the need arise.
Engineering, Research and Development
Rapid advancements in process technologies and increasing levels of functional integration characterize the market for our products. We believe that our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue improving our products and our process technologies, and to develop or acquire new technologies.
In 2021, we launched our new Global Product Development and Materials Science Center in Camarillo, California, where our VP of Engineering & Advanced Materials is located, along with other current and future resources. At this location, we focus on new product development including, among other areas, materials science and printed electronics. We also maintain a core embedded software engineering team in Singapore, and we expect to launch an engineering, research and development center in the United Kingdom. We also operate an engineering center in our facility in Shenzhen, China, which is focused on sustaining engineering, customer support, quality control and new product introduction in our force-sensing/HMI business, and an engineering and R&D facility in Newark, California, focused on new product development, SBIR-funded research and quality control.
The global R&D team pursues scientific research, technology platform development and advanced product development in areas of materials science, printed electronics devices and manufacturing processes, and multi-disciplinary system engineering. The global R&D centers support strategic partnerships with key partners in electronics manufacturing services, digital manufacturing including 3D printing and product development. This team also explores opportunities to work on government funded research projects that are aligned with our technology competencies.
Our Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 98 full-time employees worldwide. Our employees, listed in population size order from largest to smallest, are in the following departments: operations, R&D, administration, and sales. Our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is essential to our continued success. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our employee relations are good.
