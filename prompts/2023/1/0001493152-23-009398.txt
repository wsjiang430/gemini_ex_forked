ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
On January 4, 2001, ADM Endeavors, Inc. (“ADM Endeavors,” or the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in North Dakota as “ADM Enterprises, Inc.” On May 9, 2006, the Company changed its name to “ADM Endeavors, Inc.” and its domicile to the State of Nevada. On July 1, 2008, the Company acquired all of the assets of ADM Enterprises, LLC (“ADM Enterprises”) in exchange for 10,000,000 newly issued shares of Company common stock. As a result, ADM Enterprises became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. ADM then provided installation services to grocery décor and design companies primarily in North Dakota.
 
On April 19, 2018, the Company acquired Just Right Products, Inc. (“Just Right Products”), a Texas corporation, from its sole shareholder, Marc Johnson, through a share exchange transaction whereby the Company acquired 100% of Just Right Products and issued 2,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred stock (“Series A Preferred Stock”) to the shareholder of Just Rights Products. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 shares of Company common stock and each share has 100 votes on a fully diluted basis. The preferred shares represented 61% of the Company’s voting shares and constituted a change of voting control of the Company, with the transaction accounted for as a reverse acquisition. As a result of the transaction, Just Right Products became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
On January 1, 2020, the Company determined that it would discontinue its business operations in North Dakota, specifically, ADM Enterprises LLC (the “Disposed Company”). The Company transferred the Disposed Company to Ardell Mees in exchange for Mr. Mees’ assumption of the liabilities of the Disposed Company. As part of the transaction, Mr. Mees resigned from all positions with the Company and, in a private transaction, sold a significant portion of his ownership in the Company to Marc Johnson. The Company and Mr. Mees entered into an indemnification agreement pursuant to which Mr. Mees indemnified the Company for the liabilities of the Disposed Company.
 
Since that time, the Company has exclusively focused on its Just Right Productions operations.
 
Current Business Operations
 
Just Right Products
 
Since 2010, Just Right Products has operated a diverse vertical integrated business, which consists of a retail sales division, screen print promotions, embroidery production, digital production, import wholesale sourcing, and uniforms. All of these divisions are promoted and supported by SEO (Search Engine Optimization) /Web in-house department.
 
The Retail Sales Division focuses on any product with a logo. It sells a very wide range of products from business cards to coffee cups. Its motto is “We sell anything with a logo.” Just Right Products’ salespeople excel at sales because they are selling the items people like to buy. Our sales consist of sales made by in-house hourly employees and commissioned-based employees. In-house accounts are more profitable for Just Right Products than commissioned sales. Based on profitability reasons, Just Right Products has focused its resources on SEO and Website to develop more in-house customers.
 
The Screen Printing Department utilizes its five screen printing machines to print garments and other fabric items. The department can produce over 8,000 units per day. There are two types of orders, as follows: 1) Retail – where printing is done on purchased products, and 2) Contract printing – performed on wholesale customer provided products. Retail sales printing is more profitable whereas contract printing is less profitable but is beneficial at maximizing production capacity. Just Right Products is currently operating at approximately 70% of capacity with its current equipment therefore, growth without additional equipment is feasible.
 
The Embroidery equipment has 51 heads of embroidery capacity. It is the same type of production as screen printing, as stated above, in regard to retail and contract embroidery. The Embroidery Department is operating at approximately 40% of capacity with its current equipment therefore, growth without additional equipment is feasible.
 
The Digital Department also operates in the same manner as Screen Printing and Embroidery and is operating at approximately 50% of capacity based on its current equipment with significant growth potential.
 
All production departments have more equipment exceeding the workload of the employees’ potential. This gives Just Right Products the ability for expansion in revenue with the hiring of additional employees, and/or having the luxury of having backup equipment eliminating down time and the ability to handle large jobs with the help of part-time employees. The additional equipment is also part of an expansion plan.

The Import Department sources products for retail and wholesale customers. We shifted some import operations from China to Pakistan. We also have fluent Arabic, Spanish, and Hindi speakers. We are also looking at India as a possible source to replace China sourced products. The Import Division is a significant asset as it allows the Company to meet customers’ demands with flexible delivery times.
 
The Uniform Division sells uniforms to businesses, schools and municipalities. Our advantages over our competition are in-house production and international sourcing and the ability to process the seasonal demands of the uniform business. This division is able to draw labor from other departments during peak demands thereby reducing the labor expense traditionally required to facilitate this type of seasonal business.
 
The Company has selected DAC Construction of Red Oak, Texas, to build our new corporate headquarters. Danny Christensen and his team have already started the building process. Eyncon Engineering has completed drilling to conduct soil samples. The drilling consisted of four boring holes at 25 ft, and four at 20 ft and three at 6 ft. This drilling is needed to evaluate the soil and substructure before we can pour the foundation, parking and roads. Grading has been completed, and the Company is now waiting on permits to allow construction to begin. The planned facility will be 80,000 to 100,000 square feet. Funding has tentatively been secured from CapTex bank.
 
Our company currently outsources signs and banners. We hope to acquire a sign shop allowing us to bring production in house and increase margins and customer base.
 
The new facility should allow us to add a fulfilment center that will enhance service to existing customers and attract larger customers that require fulfillment. We should also be able to enhance our current online retail store and have the ability to increase our inventory capacity for existing programs.
 
The Company believes the SEO/Web department is one of the keys to future growth. The Company has seen that customers tend to go online as their first source when our products are needed. Due to this trend, the Company is focusing approximately 80% of its advertising budget to maintain and grow the Company’s online presence.
 
The Company reports its businesses under the following SIC Code: 7319, Advertising-Promotional.
 
Competition
 
Just Right Products, Inc.
 
According to Promotional Products Association International (“PPAI”), in the past five years the United States promotional products industry expanded greatly, with annual revenues of over $23 billion and growth of over 3% per year, the industry employs over 250,000 people in over 26,000 businesses. Similar to other advertising industries over the period, the growing economy fostered healthy consumer spending, so businesses respond by increasing expenditures on advertisements to capture the attention of shoppers and downstream clients. In addition, an increase in the total number of US businesses added to the industry’s potential pool of clientele, as new companies often use promotional products to endorse their business, product or service. Over the next five years, we anticipate continued growth in corporate profit and total advertising expenditure will boost industry demand, compelling companies to spend more on promotional products.
 
Every single consumer for every single product is a potential recipient of branded promotional products. Countless thousands of promotional products have a far greater reaching impact than most people might think, considering the following facts: (source: PPAI)
 

● | 83% of customers say they enjoy receiving a promotional product with an advertising message;

● | 58% of customers keep a promotional product for up to four years; 
● | 89% of customers can recall the advertiser on a promotional product they received in the past two years; and
