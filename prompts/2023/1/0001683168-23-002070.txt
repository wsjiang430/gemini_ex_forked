General Development of Business
 
Telkonet, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” or “Telkonet”), formed in 1999 and incorporated under the laws of the state of Utah, is the creator of the EcoSmart and the Rhapsody Platforms of intelligent automation solutions designed to optimize energy efficiency, comfort and analytics in support of the emerging Internet of Things (“IoT”). The platforms are deployed primarily in the hospitality, educational, governmental and other commercial markets, and is specified by engineers, HVAC professionals, building owners, and building operators. We currently operate in a single reportable business segment.
 
In 2007, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Smart Systems International (“SSI”), which was a provider of energy management products and solutions to customers in the United States and Canada and the precursor to the Company’s EcoSmart Platform. In 2020, the Company launched the Rhapsody Platform, which simplifies the installation and setup of the Company’s newest products and integrations. Both platforms provide comprehensive savings, management reporting, analytics and virtual engineering of a customer’s portfolio and/or property’s room-by-room energy consumption. Telkonet has deployed more than a half million intelligent devices worldwide in properties within the hospitality, educational, governmental and other commercial markets. The platforms are recognized as solutions for reducing energy consumption, operational costs and carbon footprints, and eliminating the need for new energy generation in these marketplaces – all whilst improving occupant comfort and convenience.
 
On August 6, 2021, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with VDA Group S.p.A., an Italian joint stock company (“VDA”), pursuant to which VDA would, at the Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), contribute $5 million to Telkonet (the “Financing”) and, in exchange, Telkonet would issue to VDA (the “Issuance”): (i) 162,900,947 shares of the Company’s common stock; and (ii) a warrant to purchase 105,380,666 additional shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Warrant”) (the Issuance and the Financing referred to collectively herein as the “VDA Transaction”). The Closing occurred on January 7, 2022.
 
Following the issuance of 162,900,947 shares of the Company’s common stock to VDA upon the Closing, VDA owns 53% of the issued and outstanding common stock on a fully diluted as exercised/converted basis, resulting in a change of control of the Company. VDA could eventually own as much as 65% of the issued and outstanding common stock on a fully diluted as exercised/converted basis if it fully exercises the Warrant. 
 
The Company has elected not to apply pushdown accounting adjustments to the Company’s financial statements related to the change in control as allowed by Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-17.
 
Form 8-K was filed on March 29, 2023, announcing the Company’s intention to voluntarily deregister its common stock from the requirements of Sections 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and suspend its reporting obligations under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Telkonet intends to file a Form 15 to effect the deregistration and suspension with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) shortly after Telkonet’s filing of its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, to be filed on or before March 31, 2023 (the “2022 10-K”). The filing of the 2022 10-K will be Telkonet’s final periodic SEC filing. For more details, please see Note P SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.

Recent Developments
 
Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic
 
We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and any lingering effects of the pandemic may continue to have, an adverse effect on many of our customers and suppliers, which has had an adverse effect on our results of operations and may affect our future results of operations.
 
We cannot predict the extent to which any lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our future business or operating results, which is highly dependent on inherently uncertain future developments, including the severity of outbreaks of COVID-19, the effects of new variants, the actions taken by governments and private businesses in relation to COVID-19 containment, the availability, deployment and efficacy of vaccines, and the transition from COVID-19 being a pandemic to an endemic illness.
 
In geographies where we, our customers and our suppliers operate, health concerns and political or governmental developments in response to COVID-19 have resulted in, and could in the future result in, economic, social or labor instability or prolonged contractions in the industries in which our customers operate, slowdowns in our sales process, customers not purchasing at all or at reduced volumes, customers failing to make payments, slowdowns in our product development efforts, or other effects that may have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations and financial condition.
 
Recently, the effects of the pandemic have been most severe in China, where we employ several members of our product development team. Because our platform is offered as a subscription-based service, the effect of the pandemic may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods, if at all.
 
The hospitality industry, our largest market that generally accounts for a majority of our revenue, has suffered as much as any since the onset of the pandemic. While the industry is trending toward recovery, the situation remains fragile. The effects of supply-chain issues, inflation, rising interest rates labor shortages, and subsequent rising wages, all present some level of pandemic uncertainty for the foreseeable future. STR and Tourism Economics reports that the U.S. hotel industry achieved revenue per available room (RevPAR) in 2022 that was above 2019 levels on a nominal basis, but would not be fully recovered (when adjusted for inflation) until 20251.
 
Preservation of Liquidity and Expense Management 
 
The Company is focused on preserving liquidity, managing expenses, and targeted sales and new product growth. The Company has taken, and is continuing to take, a number of actions to preserve cash. These actions include decreasing the use of engineering consultants, exploring cheaper alternatives for our facility leases, cancelling all non-essential travel and limiting the Company’s attendance at trade shows (implemented prior to applicable government stay-at-home orders being put in place). In early April of 2020, management made the decision to furlough certain employees, instituted pay cuts for certain other employees and suspended the Company’s 401(k) match through the end of 2020. With the receipt of a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) (discussed below), the Company was able to bring back the furloughed employees, restore payroll to prior levels and delay suspension of the 401(k) match. However, the pandemic continued to impact the Company’s operations and financial results, and consequently, in late June of 2020 management once again made the decision to furlough certain employees, instituted pay cuts for certain other employees and suspended the Company’s 401(k) match. The furloughs and pay cuts continued through September 2020, at which time management determined it was necessary to discontinue the furloughs and pay cuts in order to retain necessary personnel for the Company’s ongoing operations. The Company’s 401(k) match was reinstated in January 2023.
 
In addition to the actions noted above, on April 21, 2020, the Company entered into an unsecured promissory note, dated April 17, 2020, with Heritage Bank for a $913,063 loan under the PPP (“the First PPP Loan”). In January 2021, the Company applied for forgiveness of the amount due on the First PPP Loan. On February 16, 2021, the outstanding principal and interest accrued of $7,610 on the First PPP Loan was fully forgiven.

On April 27, 2021, the Company entered into a second unsecured promissory note, dated as of April 26, 2021, for a second PPP loan (“the Second PPP Loan” and, together with the PPP Loan, the “PPP Loans”), with Heritage Bank under a second draw of the PPP administered by the SBA and authorized by the Keeping American Workers Employed and Paid Act. In September 2021, the Company applied for forgiveness of the amount due on the Second PPP Loan. On September 15, 2021, Heritage Bank confirmed that the Second PPP Loan granted to the Company, in the original principal amount of $913,063 plus accrued interest of $3,044 thereon, was forgiven in full.
 
See Note G – Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the terms of the PPP Loans.
 
The more recent actions described above are in addition to the cost elimination and liquidity management actions that the Company began implementing in the second half of 2019, including reviewing opportunities to decrease spend with third party consultants and providers, strategically reviewing whether or not to fill employee positions in the event of vacancies, and implementing sales campaigns to sell slow-moving inventory and reduce existing inventory volumes. There is no guarantee, however, that these actions, nor any other actions identified, will yield profitable operations in the foreseeable future.
 
Markets & Products
 
Rhapsody Platform and Expanded Sales through Value-Added Resellers 
 
The Company remains focused on selling its EcoSmart Platform (discussed below) into its target markets, while also developing a new platform – Rhapsody. The Rhapsody Platform was launched in 2020. The Rhapsody Platform simplifies the installation and setup of Telkonet’s newest products and integrations. The key goals of the Rhapsody Platform are to open up Telkonet’s core products to distribution and additional resellers through expanded capabilities while also reducing the reliance on internal Telkonet resources for support.
 
The Rhapsody Platform focuses on utilizing WIFI and Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) for mobile app based setup and configuration. By utilizing an installer’s smart phone, the barrier for technical training is reduced as well as the potential commissioning and support needs of Telkonet for its value-added resellers. With continued enhancements to the Rhapsody Platform, Telkonet hopes to further grow both domestic and international value added resellers.
 
Narrative Description of the Business 
 
Telkonet is the creator of the EcoSmart and Rhapsody Platforms of intelligent automation solutions designed to optimize energy efficiency, comfort and analytics in support of the emerging IoT. The platforms are deployed primarily in the hospitality, educational, governmental and other commercial markets, and is specified by engineers, HVAC professionals, building owners, and building operators.

The EcoSmart Platform provides comprehensive energy and operational savings, management monitoring, reporting, analytics of a property or individual room by adding intelligence to HVAC runtimes and through integrations with door locks, lighting, window coverings, and more end-user attributes. The EcoSmart Platform is a solution for reducing energy consumption, operational costs and carbon footprints, and eliminating the need for new energy generation in these markets – all while engaging and delighting guests.
 
Controlling energy consumption can make a significant impact on a building’s bottom line, as HVAC costs represent a substantial portion of a facility’s overall utility bill. Hospitality is a key market for Telkonet. U.S. hotels spend an average of $2,196 per room on energy costs each year. HVAC and lighting account for approximately 45% of hotel energy usage2. Telkonet approaches the opportunity to reduce consumed energy by adding intelligence to a property’s HVAC and lighting systems.
 
Energy is often wasted through the lighting, powering, heating and cooling of unoccupied spaces. These spaces with intermittent occupancy constitute Telkonet’s target markets, and our experience, supported by independent research and customer data, suggests these rooms are unoccupied as much as 70% of the time.
 
EcoSmart Product Suite:
 

· | EcoInput: A lighting controller installed directly in line with existing light switches, making them intelligent and manageable. IoT solutions are no longer hindered by interior design requirements, often mandating specific light switches be featured in guest rooms, which can result in increased project costs. It is compatible with LED, CFL, and incandescent lighting for enhanced dimming controls.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EcoTouch Thermostat: An all touch capacitive thermostat interface available in wired and wireless models offering a premium aesthetic. The EcoTouch allows building owners to match the thermostat with the design of their room by changing the color of the outer edge and by selecting between black or white options.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | EcoInsight Thermostat: A programmable and controllable wired thermostat with over 125 configurable settings used to control the efficiency of HVAC through the use of environment variables and triggers. 
· | EcoAir Thermostat: A wireless thermostat mirroring the EcoInsight footprint while enabling the relocation of in room controls without the usual construction expense and downtime. 
· | EcoSource Controller: The remote HVAC control device associated with Telkonet’s thermostat interfaces allowing control while removing the need for expensive rewiring and construction. The EcoSource may also be used for third-party integrations, monitoring and control scenarios. 
· | EcoSmart VRF Controller: Works with most of the new variable refrigerant systems coming to market. The devices replace the EcoSource where discrete relays are not available. 
· | EcoConnect Bridge: An Ethernet to Zigbee bridge that serves as the coordinator for all EcoSmart devices connected to the intelligent automation network, managing approximately 30 - 70 device connections each. 
· | EcoCommander Gateway: EcoSmart’s network-edge gateway server that provides real-time proactive data aggregation, analytics, reporting and management of the EcoSmart product suite. 


· | EcoSense Occupancy Sensor: A remote occupancy sensor that monitors environments with ultra, high-sensitive sensors designed to detect motion or body heat. All sensors are programmed to ensure accurate occupancy detection. The EcoSense Occupancy Sensor may be hardwired or programmed to communicate wirelessly and may be battery operated or utilize external power.

· | EcoSwitch Light Switch: An EcoSmart energy management product with the appearance of a traditional ‘rocker’ light switch. Turning lights off, even for a short time, saves energy and extends lamp life. The EcoSwitch can be used to compose and automate dramatic lighting scenes in a room. 
· | EcoGuard Outlet: An EcoSmart control that acts as the replacement for an in-wall outlet and has the ability to monitor and control the flow of power to one or both outlets. Based on occupancy, it can turn off lamps, televisions, appliances, and any other energy-consuming loads that are plugged in, preventing a property from consuming power in an empty room. The EcoGuard completely disconnects devices from the power supply, preventing lights and other in-room electronics from needlessly consuming energy as well as providing monitoring of energy flow and efficiency when a plug is enabled.
· | EcoContact Door & Window Sensor: A remote, wireless door/window contact with the ability to provide additional occupancy data and control HVAC operability and other consumption measures when doors or windows are open. 

 
Several of these devices have been recently released in “Plus” models which provide greater functionality and increased capabilities.
 
EcoCentral
 
Telkonet’s EcoSmart Platform is a comprehensive solution for intelligent automation and energy management. The platform has a well-developed upgrade path with the final and complete version of the platform offering real-time control and analytics provided through a cloud computing platform called EcoCentral. EcoCentral derives its name through its ability to direct user resources to where they add the most value. From monitoring equipment operation and determining where engineering efforts are needed and notifying staff when performance is degrading, EcoCentral creates a comprehensive tool for providing insights and access for EcoSmart Platform deployments either individually or across an entire building portfolio.
 
EcoCare
 
EcoCare is Telkonet’s professional support services including call, email and chat support, repair and replacement services, periodic reporting, communication with customers’ utility and Internet Service Provider (“ISP”) partners and more. Telkonet provides three packages of EcoCare services as well as allows customers to create their own package of services ala carte. EcoCare allows EcoSmart customers to ensure that they continue to recognize the savings estimated and benefit from the intended return on investment (ROI). Typical EcoCare contracts range from one to five years and have automatic renewal terms built into each individual contract. All support staff are located at Telkonet’s Waukesha, Wisconsin headquarters.
 
Rhapsody Platform
 
Telkonet launched a new platform in 2020 named Rhapsody. Although the Rhapsody Platform shares many similarities with the EcoSmart Platform, it extends beyond some EcoSmart capabilities with native support for our new devices that use WIFI and BLE for configuration and setup. It also provides a more modern architecture to allow for enhanced scalability of real time IoT data. For example, data reporting is instantaneous with the Rhapsody Platform because it is based on data change instead of 15-minute interval reporting like the EcoSmart Platform.  The main components that make up the Rhapsody Platform are:

· | Rhapsody Dashboard: The cloud-based portal that provides remote management, monitoring and reporting capabilities of supported hardware. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rhapsody Mobile: The app that assists with the installation and configuration of all supported hardware. It also provides remote control capabilities for residential customers 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | API: The collection of interfaces available for third party data and command access to products running on the Rhapsody Platform. These interfaces include BACnet and Rest API options.

Intelligent Energy Management
 
Telkonet’s energy management platforms apply and improve building intelligence to deliver energy and cost savings through controlling lighting, plugload and HVAC runtimes. Captured data may be presented on a grouped, property or room-by-room basis, allowing very granular management of in-room energy use and environmental conditions. Telkonet achieves this by leveraging our device platforms, including occupancy sensors and intelligent programmable thermostats connected with packaged terminal air conditioner (“PTAC”) controllers or any other terminal equipment HVAC products and managed wireless light switches and in wall electrical plugs to adjust and maintain energy consumption including a room’s temperature according to occupancy, eliminating wasteful heating and cooling of unoccupied rooms. All of these can be accomplished from the in-room devices or via any web-connected device, such as smart phones, tablets and laptop computers.
 
EcoSmart and Rhapsody are energy management platforms that deliver optimal, individual room energy savings without compromising occupant comfort, due to a proprietary technology named “Recovery Time.”
 
Recovery Time Technology
 
Telkonet’s HVAC controls feature Recovery Time, technology designed to maximize energy efficiency without sacrificing occupant comfort. When a room is occupied, the temperature selected by the occupant will be maintained by the Telkonet system. Once a Telkonet occupancy sensor determines that the room is unoccupied, the system adjusts the room temperature using Recovery Time. Unlike other systems, Recovery Time technology constantly performs calculations that evaluate how far each individual room’s temperature can drift from the occupant’s preferred setting (“set-point”), to harvest energy savings while still being able to return to the occupant’s set-point within a customer’s pre-defined period of time.
 
When determining the temperature setting, Recovery Time technology considers how long it will take to return the temperature to the occupant’s set-point once they return to their room. The temperature will only drift far enough to ensure the system will return to the occupant’s preferred temperature setting within minutes upon their return to the room. The specific length of recovery time is selected by property management at the time of the installation; however, it can be altered at any time by management.
 
How Do Other Systems Work?
 
In competing systems the occupant chooses their preferred temperature. When the occupant leaves, the thermostat reverts to a set-point of a fixed number of degrees different than the preferred set temperature (lower in winter and higher in summer). In some products temperature gap is a fixed temperature selected by the property owner. Because each occupant room will require different lengths of time to return to the occupant’s desired temperature, based on room size and orientation, whether blinds are open, outdoor temperature, sun, and wind, the length of time required for the HVAC to return to temperature can vary dramatically and can often be prohibitive. Additionally, a dirty HVAC filter or coil will reduce heat transfer, increasing that recovery time.
 
EcoSmart and Rhapsody Deliver Room-by-Room Savings
 
Because each room’s environment is unique, Telkonet’s approach is likewise unique. Rooms are evaluated independently in real-time to determine its energy efficient temperature, or setback. Recovery Time technology constantly calculates in real-time how far the room temperature can drift, by taking into consideration the environmental characteristics that impact the temperature in the room, including:
 

· | The occupant’s preferred temperature setting
--+---------------------------------------------


· | The location of the room within the building
--+---------------------------------------------


· | The window placement – facing the sun or shade
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | If the drapes are open or closed
--+---------------------------------


6
-


· | If the climate is dry or humid
--+-------------------------------


· | The varying weather conditions throughout the day
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | The condition of the HVAC unit, such as age and efficiency
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 
Through the constant monitoring of the HVAC unit’s ability to drive the temperature and the real-time adjustment of the setback temperature, rooms are never excessively hot or cold when an occupant returns to the room. The room will always be just minutes away from an occupant’s desired comfort setting. As a result, Recovery Time technology delivers room-by-room, occupant-by-occupant savings. The technology also significantly improves the guest experience, driving loyalty to the property and brand, and decreases service calls.
 
The EcoSmart and Rhapsody Platforms maximize energy reductions while at the same time ensuring occupant comfort, maximizing energy savings and extending equipment life expectancy. The technology is particularly attractive to customers in the hospitality industry, as well as the education, healthcare, public housing and government/military markets, who are constantly seeking ways to reduce costs and meet federal and state mandates without impacting building occupant comfort.
 
Using standard communication protocols, ensuring widespread adoption and a simple interface, Telkonet’s technology may also be integrated with utility controls, property management systems and building automation systems to be used in load shedding initiatives. This feature provides management companies and utilities enhanced opportunities for cost savings, environmental protections and energy management. Additionally, Telkonet’s energy management systems qualify for most state and federal energy efficiency and rebate programs.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We believe our intelligent automation platforms, with our proprietary Recovery Time technology, deliver extensive differentiation against competing products, including:
 

· | Technology that evaluates each room’s environmental conditions results in maximum energy savings;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The ability to reduce HVAC runtimes increases overall equipment life;

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ROI in as little as two years; and
--+-----------------------------------


· | Mobile applications provide installation, remote management and end-user accessibility.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our open, scalable and standards-based architecture approach allows for truly custom deployments. The platforms integrate seamlessly with back-office management systems, property management systems, building automation systems, and utility demand/response programs, as well as additional third-party network architecture to recognize increased efficiency and savings.
 
Based on these platform features and capabilities, we’ve been awarded, and continue to receive, contracts in the hospitality, educational, governmental and other commercial markets. In addition, our relationships with utility-sponsored direct-install and rebate-funded programs provide us with a significant advantage over our competitors in the commercial space.
 
Given the population growth in the United States and the increasing demand for energy, we forecast additional energy-related infrastructure will be needed. We believe the use of Smart Grid technologies and energy efficiency management platforms are affordable alternatives to building additional power generation through leveraging existing resources and providing enhanced energy savings costs.
 
Target Markets
 
Rooms with intermittent occupancy are most commonly found in the following market sectors:
 

· | Hospitality: hotels, motels, resorts, timeshares and casinos.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Educational: residence halls, dormitories and other campus living options. Also K-12 environments with distributed and portable classrooms.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Government: residence halls, barracks, military apartments and other campus living options.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Healthcare: medical office buildings, assisted and independent living facilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Multiple Dwelling Units (“MDUs”): apartments and other public living options.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Industry and Market Overview
 
A significant amount of the energy consumed by commercial buildings in the United States is used to cool, heat, or light the buildings.3 In an effort to remain competitive and manage expenses, governments, building owners, building tenants, and companies in general are looking for ways to become more efficient both fiscally and environmentally. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy reported that the cost of saving one unit of energy through energy efficiency is one-fifth (1/5) the cost required to generate that same unit of energy. As a result, we feel that the growth opportunities in the energy management market are in their infancy.

Telkonet’s key industries are all prime candidates for energy management, in part due to their utilizing energy “on-demand” or intermittently. Providing energy, and engaging the equipment to supply it, to those rooms and spaces only when occupied results in significant energy savings in addition to affording longer life and reduced maintenance to the HVAC systems.
 
Hospitality Industry
 
There is a constant balancing act for hotel operators between managing guest comfort and operating margins. Telkonet’s Recovery Time allows operators to manage operation costs yet still provide for a comfortable and engaging guest experience. Through Telkonet’s platforms, individual hospitality brands and properties can create a desired guest environment and still allow for energy savings via the Recovery Time algorithm.
Educational Industry
 
Telkonet approaches the education industry with strategic relationships with enterprise energy service companies (“ESCOs”) throughout the USA. Telkonet partners with ESCOs to include our energy management platforms for deployment within residence halls on university campuses. The ESCOs bundle our technology with other facility improvement measures designed to reduce operating costs across the entire campus, bundling solutions with acceptable ROI and which meet state mandated guidelines. ESCOs also structure self-funding financial transactions called “Performance Contracts” in which the savings are greater than the repayment costs, typically guaranteeing the financial and operational performance in this type of engagement. This type of approach can remove any capital expense barriers and improve adoption.
 
During our history, deployments have occurred at the University of California-Davis, University of Miami, Kansas State University, North Carolina State University, University of Notre Dame, US Military Academy at West Point, New York University, and Texas A&M University-Commerce.
 
The opportunities in this market are not limited to higher education institutions. According to an NRG Business Energy Advisor report, schools in the United States spend $8 billion on energy costs annually, with 73% of natural gas use going towards heating and 35% of electricity consumption going towards cooling. While heating and cooling account for only 2 – 4% of district costs, it is an opportunity for significant impact and gain.
 
We believe that our platforms are important tools for participants in the education industry seeking to control student-related energy costs. We have focused our sales efforts on members of the education industry who are seeking to expand their energy efficiency initiatives as well as the ESCOs who target the educational marketplace and have thus far had success with at least one school district installing EcoSmart in each classroom throughout the district.
 
Governmental Industry
 
The Department of Defense (“DOD”) is the single largest energy consumer in the United States federal government – accounting for more than 76% of the entire federal government’s energy expenditures during FY2017.4 Thus, we view this market as strategically significant to Telkonet’s interests.
 
Our energy management platforms are already successfully incorporated into the energy initiatives in several military housing sites, military academies and barracks. Telkonet benefited from and continues to make use of government funding and other government contracts to provide our platforms for use on military bases and other facilities, helping both the DOD and the government as a whole achieve their long-term energy efficiency goals.

Healthcare Industry
 
Healthcare organizations currently spend over $6.5 billion on energy each year, a cost which continues to rise in an effort to meet patient needs5. This is viewed as an emerging market for energy management systems. Although hospitals have many specific regulatory mandates, Telkonet has been working closely with operators and developers of healthcare support facilities, like medical office buildings, assisted living and other similar facilities, to integrate our energy management initiatives into efficiency opportunities supported by state and federal energy programs. For example, hospital energy managers can use energy efficiency strategies to offset high costs caused by growing plug loads and rising energy prices. A typical 200,000-square-foot, 50-bed hospital in the U.S. annually spends $680,000, or roughly $13,611 per bed on electricity and natural gas. By increasing energy efficiency, hospitals can improve the bottom line and free up funds to invest in new technologies and improve patient care.
 
These facilities offer a commercial environment similar to the hospitality or educational housing markets, and the increasing aging population and assisted living markets present attractive potential for energy efficiency. This market is expected to grow rapidly over the next several years due to its energy savings capabilities and an aging population.
 
MDU Industry
 
Public housing, which are properties owned and managed by the government, is an additional emerging market for energy management solutions. The tenants occupying these properties must meet specific eligibility requirements, and their utility bills are typically paid for by government programs. Many of the ESCO clients that Telkonet supports today have dedicated teams pursuing opportunities with the owners and operators of government-subsidized housing. Telkonet’s platforms are an ideal solution for conserving energy, allowing remote monitoring, and improving tenant comfort.
 
Competition for Markets
 
We currently compete primarily within commercial and industrial markets, including the hospitality, education, healthcare, governmental and MDU sectors. Within each target market, we offer savings through our intelligent automation platforms. Our products offer significant competitive and complementary benefits when compared with alternative offerings including Building Automation Systems (“BAS”) or Building Management Systems (“BMS”), static temperature occupancy-based systems, scheduling/programmable thermostats and high-efficiency HVAC systems.
 
We participate in a relatively small competitive field within the hospitality industry, with the majority of the energy management sales handled by fewer than seven manufacturers. The key competitors in the market segment are Inncom by Honeywell and Schneider Electric, with each offering some level of comparable products to our standalone and/or networked products. Telkonet leverages the above-mentioned competitive advantages to successfully compete in these spaces and win business.
 
The educational space is new to adopt occupancy-based controls. Our platforms have been introduced for use within student dormitories, which traditionally had few, if any, controls. More recently we’ve also been requested to install our products into classrooms, which traditionally have been an environment for BAS/BMS. Since the dormitory environment is very similar to the hospitality market, we believe we offer similarly-scaled energy savings. Since the market is still in its infancy, very few comparable offerings have entered the market but competitors within the hospitality segment are beginning to respond. Again, our key differentiators allow us to compete and win business in this space.

The healthcare and governmental markets are very similar in scope, relative to energy management systems. A key differentiator in these environments is the specific implementation being considered. Each market utilizes BAS/BMS for wide scale energy management initiatives. When addressing housing environments, including elderly care and assisted living facilities and military dormitories or barracks, Telkonet’s platforms are able to provide increased energy savings and efficiency. Competitors operating in the BAS/BMS space include Honeywell, Schneider Electric, Johnson Controls, Siemens, Trane and others, many of whom Telkonet partners with to provide a comprehensive and integrated energy management solution to effectively address energy efficiency opportunities in all types of facilities. The MDU market is split into two distinct categories, public and upscale residential housing. Public housing benefits similarly to hospitality and educational housing where intelligent, occupancy-based automation reduces operating costs.  Upscale residential facilities benefit from exclusive automation solutions and centralized data reporting resulting in maintenance efficiencies.
 
Inventory
 
We are dependent on a limited number of vendors to provide certain inventory and components. We’ve not experienced significant problems or issues purchasing any essential materials, parts or components, but have experienced gross profit pressure as a result of price increases and the impact of tariffs (discussed below). We contract the majority of our inventory with ATR Manufacturing, based in China, which provides substantially all the manufacturing requirements for Telkonet’s energy management platforms. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 81% of our total purchases were from ATR Manufacturing.
Customers
 
We are neither limited to, nor reliant upon, a single or narrowly segmented customer base to derive our revenues. Our current focus includes the hospitality, educational, governmental, healthcare, and MDU markets, as well as expanding into the consumer market specifically through our resale channel as part of our long term strategic growth.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers represented approximately 20% and 17% of total net revenues, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer represented approximately 18% of total net revenues.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Telkonet has acquired certain intellectual properties, including but not limited to patent US-10564660-B2 granted 2/18/20 on the water heater energy management controller and a provisional patent US-20200022243-A1 granted 20/1/16 on the lighting dimmer module and method of calibration. While we view these patents as valuable, we do not view any single patent as material to the Company as a whole.
 
There can be no assurance that any of our current or future patent applications will be granted, or, if granted, that such patents will provide necessary protection for our technology or our product offerings, or be of commercial benefit to us.
 
On November 30, 2020, Telkonet entered into a Wireless Network Patent License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Sipco, LLC (“Sipco”) and IPCO, LLC dba IntusIQ (collectively, the “Licensors”) in order to settle a patent infringement lawsuit without the expense of costly litigation. Without admission as to infringement, validity, or enforceability of the Licensed Patents (as defined in the License Agreement) or liability with respect to any claims of the complaint filed in the patent infringement lawsuit, Telkonet has agreed to pay certain royalty fees to the Licensors in exchange for the right under the Essential Claims (as defined in the License Agreement) of the Licensed Patents (as defined in the License Agreement), including multiple essential wireless mesh (“EWM”) patents to manufacture, have manufactured, sell, offer to sell, import, export, and use the Licensed Products (as defined in the License Agreement). The EWM patent portfolio covers technologies used in multi-hop wireless networks utilizing wireless protocols such as, but not limited to, Zigbee. The portfolio also covers applications including, but not limited to, home and building automation and industrial controls.
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a current liability of approximately $200,000, of which $60,000 is included in accounts payable and $140,000 in other accrued liabilities (See Note F – Current Accrued Liabilities for further breakdown of accrued liabilities), along with a non-current liability of $220,000 included in accrued royalties – long-term recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. The corresponding expense was recorded in 2020 in the selling, general and administrative line of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The payment of the royalty fees is expected to have a material and adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and liquidity. See Note M – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the patent infringement lawsuit and the License Agreement.

Government Regulation
 
As discussed in Item IA – Risks Relating to Our Financial Results, given the fact that we purchase the majority of our inventory from a supplier based in China, we are subject to and have been adversely affected by the tariffs imposed by the United States Federal Government on imports of industrial sector products from China.
 
In addition, we are subject to regulation in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”).  FCC rules permit the operation of unlicensed digital devices that radiate radio frequency emissions if the manufacturer complies with certain equipment authorization procedures, technical requirements, marketing restrictions and product labeling requirements.
 
Future products designed by us will require testing for compliance with FCC and European Commission (“EC”) standards. Moreover, if in the future, the FCC or EC changes its technical requirements, further testing and/or modifications may be necessary in order to achieve compliance.
 
Research & Development
 
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company spent $1,070,473 and $1,129,957, respectively, on research and development activities. Telkonet continues to invest in research & development to maintain and grow our competitive differentiation and customer value.
