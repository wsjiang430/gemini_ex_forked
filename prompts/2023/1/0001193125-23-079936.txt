ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 Mastech Digital, Inc. (referred to in this report as “Mastech Digital”, “Mastech”, the “Company”, “us”, “our” or “we”) is a provider of Digital Transformation IT Services. The Company offers data and analytics 
 
1 


  solutions; digital learning; and IT staffing services for both digital and mainstream technologies. Headquartered near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we have approximately 1,560 consultants that provide services across a broad spectrum of industry verticals. We do not sell, lease or otherwise market computer software or hardware and essentially 100% of our revenue is derived from the sale of data and analytics, IT staffing and digital transformation services through our two reportable segments, Data and Analytics Services and IT Staffing Services. 
 Our Data and Analytics Services segment delivers specialized data management, data engineering, customer experience consulting, data analytics and cloud services to customers globally. Each of these services can be delivered using onsite and offshore resources. 
 Our IT Staffing Services segment combines technical expertise with business process experience to deliver a broad range of services in digital and mainstream technologies. Our digital technology services include data management and analytics, cloud, mobility, social and automation. Our digital transformation services also include staffing and project-based services around digital learning. Our mainstream technologies services include business intelligence / data warehousing; web services; enterprise resource planning & customer resource management; and e-Business solutions. We work with businesses and institutions with significant IT-spend and recurring staffing needs. We also support smaller organizations with their “project focused” temporary IT staffing requirements. Additionally, we provide offshore staffing services to our U.S.-based clients and local offshore clients. 
 Sales and marketing of our services are handled by separate and distinct sales organizations within each of our two business segments. Our data and analytic services are marketed through 1) account executives who largely focus on new business development; and 2) technical relationship managers (principals) who focus on growing strong relationships within existing clients. Both account executives and technical relationship managers reside in the U.S., Canada, India and the U.K. 
 Our IT staffing and digital transformation services are marketed through account executives across the U.S. who deploy a telesales model, supplemented with client visits. This cost-effective model is aimed at integrator and other staffing clients, with a need to supplement their abilities to attract highly qualified temporary IT personnel. Additionally, we use a branch service sales model in select geographies within the U.S. The branch services model employs local sales and recruitment resources, aimed at establishing strong relationships with both end-clients and candidates. 
 We recruit for both segments through global recruitment centers located in the U.S. and India that deliver a full range of recruiting and sourcing services. Our centers employ approximately 225 recruiters and sourcers that focus on recruiting U.S.-based candidates to service a geographically-diverse client base in the U.S. Our ability to respond to client requests from our offshore recruiting centers, with their expanded search coverage, round-the-clock sourcing, and extensive pool of candidates, gives us the ability to deliver high-quality candidates to our clients in a timely fashion. 
 History and Developments 
 Historically, we operated as the former Professional Services segment of iGATE Corporation (“iGATE”). Mastech Digital, Inc. (f/k/a Mastech Holdings, Inc.) was incorporated in Pennsylvania as a wholly-owned subsidiary of iGATE on June 6, 2008 in anticipation of our spin-off from iGATE. On September 30, 2008, we spun-off from iGATE and began operating as an independent public company. Together with our operating subsidiaries, we have over 35 years of history as a reliable provider of IT staffing services. 
 Established in 1986, our business model focused on importing global IT talent to the U.S. to meet the growing demand for IT professionals. In the early 2000s, the demand for IT professionals declined and the supply of IT resources quickly exceeded a declining demand curve. No longer was there a need to recruit abroad 
 
2 


  for technology talent, as supply was abundant in the U.S. Accordingly, we retooled our recruiting model to focus on the recruitment of local U.S.-based IT talent. Given our reputation with and knowledge of H1-B visas, part of our recruiting efforts focused on attracting H1-B visa holders currently in the U.S. This approach gave us access to a larger and differentiated recruiting pool when compared to many of our competitors. 
 In 2003, we launched our offshore global recruitment center model in an effort to meet an increase in industry demand with lower cost recruiting resources. Over the last nineteen years, we have made significant investments in our offshore center to improve infrastructure, processes and effectiveness. Additionally, we have made investments in our domestic recruitment structure, primarily to support our branch service model. 
 On June 15, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Hudson Global Resources Management, Inc.’s U.S. IT staffing business (“Hudson IT”). Hudson IT was a domestic IT staffing business with offices in Chicago, Boston, Tampa and Orlando. Hudson IT deployed a branch service business model that targeted clients that are direct end-users of IT staffing services. Additionally, as part of the Hudson IT acquisition, we acquired a digital learning services practice which became one of our technology practices. 
 In 2016, we changed our name to Mastech Digital, Inc. The name change was part of our rebranding initiative that reflects our transformation into a digital technologies company. The rebranding also included a logo change and a refreshed corporate website. 
 In 2017, we added specialized capabilities in delivering data management and analytics services to a global customer-base through the acquisition of the services division of InfoTrellis, Inc. (“InfoTrellis”), a project-based consulting services company with specialized capabilities in data management and analytics. 
 In 2018 and 2019, we significantly expanded our service offerings and capabilities within our Data and Analytics Services segment. 
 In 2020, we launched a new service offering in our IT Staffing Services segment branded as MAS-REMOTE. This new offering allows clients to transcend beyond self-imposed geographical boundaries to gain access to top talent in the U.S. and Canada and reflects learnings from the COVID-19 pandemic that remote workers can be equally or more effective. Also in 2020, we completed the acquisition of AmberLeaf Partners, Inc., (“AmberLeaf”) which enhanced our Data and Analytics Services segment’s capabilities with its expertise in customer experience consulting and managed services. 
 In 2021, we added cloud service capabilities to our Data and Analytics Services segment and expanded our IT Staffing Services segment’s MAS-REMOTE offering to include off-shore staffing services. 
 In 2022, we established in new subsidiary in NOIDA, India to support our offshore staffing services business. 
 Operating Segments 
 Our revenues are generated from two business segments: Data and Analytics Services and IT Staffing Services. Details related to these two businesses are discussed separately below, while information about our employees, differentiators, intellectual property rights and various other aspects of our business is shown in the aggregate for Mastech Digital, Inc. 
Data and Analytics Services 
 Our Data and Analytics Services segment began with the acquisition of InfoTrellis, Inc.’s service business in July 2017. InfoTrellis, Inc. was founded by the engineering principals behind IBM’s Master Data Management (“MDM”) products and Informatica’s Customer 360 code-base. This acquisition provided Mastech InfoTrellis 
 
3 


  with a solid foundation upon which to build, as we acquired a business with one of the largest concentrations of technology-agnostic data management expertise in the marketplace. With our October 2020 acquisition of AmberLeaf, we gained complimentary capabilities in customer experience consulting and managed services, as well as a sizeable roster of existing clients. 
 Today, professional service firms have increasingly focused their efforts on partnering with their clients on enterprise-wide Digital Transformation. Organizations that are not digitally-native are facing increased pressure to modernize the way they operate to remain competitive within their industry. The landscape of digital transformation providers is constantly changing with new entrants. There is constant positioning and re-positioning of existing providers to claim new and niche spaces within the transformation arena. Additionally, the components of “Digital Transformation” are open to interpretation. While there continues to be large scale discussion and a lack of consensus on what constitutes Digital Transformation, there is a general view that, at the core of the (r)evolution is Data Modernization — migration from legacy platforms, processes and strategies to new, dynamic, cloud-based approaches that focus on solving business problems and driving business outcomes. 
 Data Modernization is the core focus of our Data and Analytics Services segment. We have partnered with industry leaders in this space and intend to continue to broaden our reach with new partners in the future. With our recent investments, our world class delivery center in Chennai, India provides us with the ability to increase capacity to nearly 500 concurrent team members, while providing white glove access to upwards of a dozen additional clients in their own dedicated “clean rooms”. We are also re-aligning ourselves to be a more dynamic, globally integrated organization across our traditional services offerings and to support our goal of expanding beyond niche services and providing full Data Modernization support to a wide range of organizations — from a $10 million start up to a Fortune 100 enterprise. Our mission is a simple one — we help clients put data in front of the people and machines where prudent decisions are made. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and Marketing at our Data and Analytics Services segment is a single, integrated function spanning across four groups in multiple locations: Marketing, Inside Sales, Principals, and Client Partners. 

• | Our Marketing team is responsible for designing outbound campaigns around data and business value, for dissemination through our omni channels and industry publications. Our Marketing team also works with our experts and thought leaders to create and disseminate data management, data engineering and data science thought leadership articles and white papers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our Inside Sales team is responsible for operating integrated email outbound marketing campaigns targeted at specific industries and functional populations, on an ongoing basis.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our onshore team of Principals and Client Partners is responsible for building buyer relationships with prospects and leads, and for converting those conversations into value-positive revenue generating engagements.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our typical credit terms require our invoices to be paid within 45 to 60-days of receipt by the client.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition to the above, our Partner / Alliance Relationships (such as those we have with IBM and Informatica, Oracle, among others) also provide us with a significant pipeline of opportunities and new business. Furthermore, prospective clients reach us through referrals from our existing client base, our reputation in the data & analytics domain, and through our industry partners. 
 Once engaged with a prospect, our approach to value-delivery starts with the definition of a discrete business problem. We then master and manage our clients’ data and develop data products and deploy purpose-built advanced analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to deliver greater business velocity, significant cost reduction, and greater corporate resilience.

Geographic and Vertical Focus 
 Mastech InfoTrellis’ primary customer geographies are in North America; however, we have customers and prospects in Europe. Our target clients are largely corporations with revenues exceeding $1 billion and include Fortune 100 organizations. Our typical project size, excluding our multi-year Center of Excellence contracts, is in the $500,000 to $2.5 million range depending on the scope and duration of the engagement. Our Center of Excellence contracts generally range from $5 million to $12 million. From a vertical perspective, customers in the financial services, retail, healthcare, manufacturing and government segments are significant users of our services. Below is a breakdown of customer revenue percentages for each industry vertical in 2022: 

Financial Services | 37 | % | Healthcare | 16 | %
Manufacturing | 21 | % | Government | 5 | %
Retail | 16 | % | Other | 5 | %

IT Staffing Services 
 In our IT Staffing Services business, we typically negotiate our business relationship by using one of three methods to gain agreement on the services to be provided. We either establish our relationship based on a simple standard term sheet; create a Statement of Work (“SOW”) specific to a project; or enter into a master service agreement with a client that describes the framework of our relationship. In each case, a client will submit to us 
 
6 


  positions and / or requirements that they plan on satisfying by using temporary contractors. We propose consultants to the client that we believe satisfy their needs and propose an hourly bill rate for each consultant submitted. The client will select our consultant or a competing firm’s consultant based on their view of quality, fit and pricing. Consultant specific contractual details, such as billable rates, are documented as an annex to the agreement type that is chosen by the client. While we have the ability to deliver our digital transformation services on a managed solutions basis, the vast majority of our assignments have been delivered as staffing assignments. 
 We generally do not enjoy exclusivity with respect to a client’s contractor needs. Most of our clients use multiple suppliers to satisfy their requirements and to ensure a competitive environment. Our success with any particular client is determined by (a) the quality and fit of our consultant; (b) our ability to deliver a quality consultant on a timely basis; and (c) pricing considerations. We invoice our clients on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, in accordance with the terms of our agreement. Typical credit terms require our invoices to be paid within 30 to 45 days of receipt by the client. 
 While our primary focus is on contract IT staffing and digital transformation services, we also provide permanent placement services for our clients when opportunities arise. Permanent placement revenues have historically represented approximately 1% of our total revenues. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We target much of our marketing efforts on businesses and institutions with significant budgets and recurring IT staffing and digital transformation needs. We look to develop relationships with new clients. In addition, we work to penetrate our existing client relationships to deeper levels. Most of our strategic relationships are established at the vice president / sales director level. 
 Selling is conducted through account executives utilizing a sales model which is desirable to our clients’ needs. For clients with a need to supplement their own abilities to attract highly qualified temporary IT personnel and prefer a low-touch sales model, such as integrator and staffing clients, we generally deploy a centralized telesales model, complemented with client visits. We supplement these domestic sales efforts through our sales organization in India, whose account executives target smaller IT staffing clients utilizing a cost-effective offshore telesales model. For end-user clients, who typically prefer a higher-touch sales model, we generally utilize a branch service model which deploys sales and recruitment resources locally, or regionally, in select geographies within the U.S. Account executives generally are responsible for a combination of new business development efforts and expanding existing client relationships. Account executives at our branch operations call on, and meet with, potential new customers and are also responsible for maintaining existing client relationships within their geographic territory. These account executives are paired with recruiters and both receive incentive compensation based on revenue generation activities using a localized sales and recruitment model. 
 Many large end-users of IT staffing services retain a third party to provide vendor management services to centralize the consultant hiring process and reduce costs. Under this arrangement, the third-party managed service provider (“MSP”) retains control of the vendor selection and vendor evaluation process, which somewhat weakens the relationship built with the client. Our lower-cost centralized telesales model and highly efficient offshore recruiting model have better positioned us to respond to the growing use of MSPs. 
 Recruiting 
 We operate several small recruiting centers located in the U.S. and one significantly larger facility in NOIDA, India that deliver a full range of recruiting and sourcing services. Our centers employ approximately 225 recruiters and sourcers who focus on recruiting U.S.-based candidates to service a geographically diverse client base in the U.S. Our ability to respond to client requests faster than the competition is critical for success in our industry as most staffing firms access the same candidate pool via job boards and websites. The combination 
 
7 


  of our offshore recruiting capabilities, investment in sourcing and recruiting processes, expanded search coverage, around-the-clock sourcing, and extensive candidate pool, gives us the ability to deliver high-quality candidates to our clients in a timely fashion. 
 We continue to invest in leading technologies and recruitment tools to enhance efficiencies. For example, we use artificial intelligence and web-based tools to expand the reach of our candidate searches. We also employ a state-of-the-art applicant tracking system that has recently been enhanced with proprietary tool-kits and job board / internet interfacing capabilities, resulting in further operational efficiencies. 
 In late 2018, we significantly expanded our offshore recruitment offices in NOIDA which gave us the ability to nearly double our recruiter seats. This facility provides our offshore organization with state-of-the-art infrastructure and workforce amenities to attract top-quality recruiters and sourcers. This centralized offshore facility also affords us the ability to improve operational efficiencies compared to operating two offshore facilities. 
 We have access to a large and differentiated recruiting pool due to our brand recognition with both U.S. citizens and H1-B visa holders in the U.S. Unlike most staffing firms that have a high concentration of either H1-B workers or W-2 hourly U.S. citizens, we have historically maintained a balance of H1-B and W-2 hourly employees. We believe that this balanced mix allows us to access a broader candidate pool than our primary competition. 
 Technology and Client Focus of our IT Staffing and Digital Transformation Services 
 Our staffing delivery teams, spread across the U.S. and India, are segmented 1) by technologies, allowing us to reach deep and wide in our understanding of technology domains; and 2) by client relationships which gives us a keen understanding of our clients’ needs and preferences. The delivery teams work in an integrated manner to provide quality IT talent with a faster turnaround time than many of our competitors. We have long-standing engagements with marquee brands and other premier global enterprises across various industries. 
 IT Staffing — Digital Technologies 
Recognizing that a new breed of IT professionals adept in digital technologies are in high demand, we enhanced our recruitment capabilities to focus on digital technology skill sets. Today, Mastech Digital provides its clients with the ability to secure skill sets that encompass social, mobile, analytics, cloud-based technologies and automation. IT staffing for digital technologies is growing much faster than mainstream technologies, a trend that is expected to continue into the future. Digital technologies include the following areas: 

• Social Analytics | • Data Engineering 
• Social Blogging | • Data Analytics 
• Social Campaign Management | • Data Science 
• Enterprise Mobility Strategy | • Cloud Strategy 
• Mobile Application Development | • Cloud Implementation and Support 
• Artificial Intelligence | • Machine Learning 

 
8 


 IT Staffing — Mainstream Technologies 
 A large part of our business today comes from IT staffing services around mainstream technologies. We provide services and have strategic relationships in many high-demand mainstream technology areas. Our IT professionals help design, develop, integrate, maintain and support mainstream technologies in the following areas: 

• Mainframes | • Open Source (JAVA) 
• Databases | • Data Warehousing 
• Middleware | • Microsoft (C, .NET, SQL) 
• Enterprise Systems | • IT Administration 
• SoA and Web Services | • IT Helpdesk and Support 
• Verification and Validation | • Business Analysis 
• Project Management | 

Digital Learning Services 
 Our digital learning practice provides custom training programs for different organizational needs. With rich experience and proven success in handling several learning and performance engagements across industries, Mastech Digital’s team combines digital and physical modes of learning methods to ensure unified organizational behavior and augmented performance across teams. Mastech Digital’s learning paradigm consists of web-based learning, mobile learning, social learning, hybrid learning and virtual learning. 
 Geographic Presence & Industry Verticals 
 All of our IT staffing services revenues are generated from services provided in the U.S. We market our services on a national basis and have the ability to provide services in all 50 U.S. States. Our geographical concentration tends to track major client locations, such as California, Texas, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts, and in large metropolitan areas such as Chicago and New York City. 
 We provide these services across a broad spectrum of industry verticals, including: financial services, government, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, technology, telecommunications and transportation. Below is a breakdown of our IT Staffing billable consultant base by industries that represented at least 5% of our billable consultants as of December 31, 2022: 
 

Financial Services | 53 | % | Technology | 6 | %
Healthcare | 9 | % | Retail | 5 | %
Government | 8 | % | Other | 12 | %
Telecom | 7 | % | | | 

Mastech Digital, Inc. 
 Employees 
 At December 31, 2022, we had 1,071 North American employees and 624 employees offshore, in addition to 324 subcontracted professionals. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our Company. We employ our consultants on both an hourly and salary basis. A large portion of our salaried employees are H1-B visa holders. We believe that we enjoy a good reputation within the H1-B visa community, which allows us to access a very broad candidate pool. The majority of our hourly employees are U.S. citizens. On average, we maintain a balanced composition of salaried and hourly employees. We believe that our employee relations are good. 
Intellectual Property Rights 
 Our intellectual property consists primarily of proprietary processes; client, employee and candidate information; and proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property. We also own 
 
9 


  proprietary knowledge of the frameworks and products that we have built in our Mastech InfoTrellis business. We rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other arrangements to protect our intellectual property. 
 Seasonality 
 Our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations. However, our consultants’ billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation trends. Accordingly, we typically have lower utilization rates during the fourth quarter. Additionally, assignment completions tend to be higher near the end of the calendar year, which largely impact our revenue and gross profit performance during the subsequent quarter. 
Our Competitive Position 
 We operate in highly competitive and fragmented industries, with largely low barriers to entry in our IT Staffing Services segment. In our Data and Analytics Services segment, we primarily compete with Cognizant, Tata Consultancy Services, Deloitte, Accenture, as well as with smaller boutique data and analytics firms. Many competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources in comparison to us. Our IT Staffing Services segment competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, other staffing services firms and, to a lesser extent, temporary personnel agencies. 
 We believe that the principal competitive factors for securing and building client relationships are driven by the ability to precisely comprehend client requirements and by providing highly qualified personnel who are motivated to meet or exceed a client’s expectations. We must be able to do this efficiently to provide speed to market with pricing that is competitive and represents value to our clients. The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified personnel are compensation, availability, location, quality of projects and schedule flexibility. We believe that many of the professionals included in our database may also pursue other employment opportunities. Therefore, our responsiveness to the needs of these professionals is an important factor in our ability to be successful. 
 Our Strengths 
 We believe our strengths compared to industry peers include: 
 Established client-base 
 Our client base consists of large, medium-sized and small companies that span across multiple industry verticals. Long-standing relationships with corporate clients, blue-chip IT integrators and MSPs are a core component of our future growth strategy for our staffing business, while good relationships with customer influencers and C-level decision makers drives our Mastech InfoTrellis business. These relationships, exemplified by our consistently low customer attrition rate, reflect our focus and commitment to our customers. 
 Operational excellence 
 In our Data and Analytics Services business, our global delivery model is designed to ensure operational excellence by delivering higher value to our customers on project-based Mastech InfoTrellis engagements. Projects are delivered using our proprietary SMART Implementation Methodology — a multi-phased approach based on parts of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and Agile development methodologies. 
 In the IT Staffing Services business, operational excellence largely relates to a firm’s ability to effectively recruit high quality talent. Our offshore recruitment operation gives us the ability to respond to clients’ staffing needs in a timely and cost-effective manner. Investments in sourcing and recruiting processes and leading technologies and recruitment tools have resulted in a highly scalable offshore recruiting model, which has delivered value to our clients. 
 
10 


 Additionally, we employ a human resource management model, featuring portal technology as well as immigration support services, for our widely dispersed consultant base. This model enables us to maintain attrition rates that are lower than the industry averages for our salaried workforce. 
 Minority-owned status 
 Our businesses benefit with some clients from the fact that we are a large minority-owned staffing firm. We have received multiple awards for our commitment to diversity. We have been certified as a minority-owned business by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (“NMSDC”). This certification is attractive to certain existing and potential clients in the U.S. government and public-sector segments, where project dollars are specifically earmarked for diversity spending. 
 Attractive financial profile 
 We have historically enjoyed a lower operating cost structure than our industry peers due to our low cost telesales in our IT Staffing Services segment and our offshore delivery models in both of our operating segments. These business models are cost-effective and allow us to quickly adjust our cost structure to changes in our business environment. Our blue-chip client base has resulted in high quality accounts receivable and a strong and predictable cash flow conversion metric. Additionally, we have an existing credit facility to support our organic and inorganic growth aspirations. 
 Expertise in high-demand digital transformation IT skills 
 In our Data and Analytics Services segment, we have strong expertise in data management, data engineering, analytics and customer experience consulting — both in North America as well as off-shore. Additionally, we have considerable industry experience by serving some of the world’s most-respected brands in financial services, manufacturing, retail and healthcare. 
 In our IT Staffing Services segment, we have substantial expertise in certain advanced technology IT skills, including: cloud, mobile, data & analytics, social media, artificial intelligence/machine learning and digital learning. We also have the capacity in both of our business segments to take advantage of our technical expertise in these high demand growth areas, as we are well positioned in terms of scale, capabilities, and a blue-chip client base. 
 Experienced management team 
 Business leaders of our Data and Analytics Services business were part of the original thought leaders in the Master Data Management space, which lends significant credibility to this segment’s Master Data service offerings. Today, we are led by an executive team of “business transformation” veterans and data science experts, with a track record of delivering positive business outcomes for clients across industry verticals. 
 Our IT staffing management team is comprised of business leaders with deep industry experience, is a unique blend of executives with significant Mastech Digital experience and others who have held leadership roles in other companies. We believe this talent, together with combined experience across a variety of industries, allows us to capitalize on the positives of our existing business models and, at the same time, improve our service offerings, internal processes and long-term strategy for future growth. 
 Reportable Financial Segments 
 The Company has two reportable segments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 280 “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”. Refer to Note 18 “Business Segments and Geographic Information” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 herein for information about our two reportable segments.

 Government Regulation 
 We recruit IT professionals on a global basis from time to time and, therefore, must comply with the immigration laws in the countries in which we operate. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 27% of our workforce was working under Mastech Digital sponsored H1-B temporary work permits. Statutory law limits the number of new H1-B petitions that may be approved in a fiscal year to enter the U.S. Legislation could be enacted limiting H1-B visa holders’ employment with staffing companies. In recent years, the vast majority of our H1-B hires were not subject to the annual quota limiting H1-B visas because they were already in the U.S. under H1-B visa status with other employers. Additionally, the U.S. Congress has recently considered, and may consider in the future, extensive changes to U.S. immigration laws regarding the admission of high-skilled temporary and permanent workers and increases in prevailing wage related to H1-B employees. Such changes, if enacted, may impact the types of H1-B temporary work permits that could be granted, the number of available H1-B temporary work permits, or the required prevailing wage that we are required to pay our H1-B employees, which in turn may have a negative impact on our revenues and profits.
