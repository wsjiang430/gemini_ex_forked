Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel disease-modifying approach to target what we believe to be a key underlying cause of Alzheimer’s disease, or AD. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain that leads to loss of memory and cognitive functions and ultimately results in death. Our scientific founders pioneered research on soluble amyloid-beta oligomers, or AßOs, which are globular assemblies of the amyloid-beta, or Aß, peptide that are distinct from Aß monomers and amyloid plaques. Based on decades of research and supporting evidence, AßOs have gained increasing scientific acceptance as a primary toxin involved in the initiation and propagation of AD pathology. We are currently focused on advancing a targeted immunotherapy drug candidate, ACU193, through clinical proof of mechanism trials in early AD patients. ACU193 is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin gamma 2, or IgG2, monoclonal antibody, or mAb, that was designed to selectively target AßOs, has demonstrated functional and protective effects in in vitro assays, and has demonstrated in vivo safety and pharmacologic activity in multiple animal species, including transgenic models for AD.
ACU193 is the result of over a decade of research and development undertaken by the company, which included a drug discovery partnership with Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, from 2003 to 2011. ACU193’s mechanism of action is intended to slow disease progression and potentially preserve or improve memory function in early AD patients by binding to AßOs and neutralizing their toxicity. AßOs have been shown to bind to neurons, contributing to synaptic malfunction, memory deficits, cognitive impairment and, ultimately, neurodegeneration and cell death. As such, we believe AßOs are the most toxic and pathogenic form of Aß in the brains of AD patients relative to other forms of amyloid, including Aß monomers and amyloid plaques. We believe the development and commercialization of a drug that reduces toxicity of AßOs is one of the most promising approaches for the potential treatment and prevention of the progression of AD. 
In our nonclinical studies, we observed that ACU193 has over 500-fold greater selectivity for targeting AßOs over Aß monomers and, based on immunohistochemical studies of human AD brain tissue, appears to have limited or no binding to amyloid plaques. Also, ACU193 potently prevents binding of AßOs to hippocampal neurons and preserves long-term potentiation for those cell, an electrophysiological surrogate for brain circuit function such as memory. Recent laboratory studies conducted by Acumen and others suggest that inhibiting AßOs may enable damaged brain circuits to regain some function and prevent further degeneration from occurring. ACU193 has demonstrated in vivo biochemical and behavioral activity in several AD mouse models, including crossing the blood-brain barrier and forming complexes with AßOs in a dose-dependent manner. ACU193 has shown consistent pharmacokinetics and brain penetration properties in four animal species. Safety toxicology studies in rats and monkeys provide acceptable margins for acute and chronic dosing in the clinic. Additionally, studies in transgenic mice indicate low potential for microhemorrhage. Based in part on its binding selectivity for AßOs rather than amyloid plaques, ACU193 has the potential to have a lower rate of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA, than the plaque-directed anti-amyloid antibody therapies currently in development or approved. ARIA is a common adverse event for antibodies targeting amyloid plaque and can be a dose-limiting safety liability for those antibodies. 
We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of ACU193 in the second quarter of 2021, which we named “INTERCEPT-AD.” This trial enrolled 65 patients with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, due to AD, conditions referred to as “early AD.” INTERCEPT-AD is a U.S.-based, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with overlapping single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts involving patients with early AD. The overall objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ACU193 and to establish clinical proof of mechanism of ACU193 administered intravenously. The primary trial endpoints are focused on safety and immunogenicity. An important safety measure will be the use of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, to assess the presence or absence of ARIA. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetics in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, and target engagement as evidenced by detection of ACU193 bound to AßOs in CSF. Clinical scales typically used in AD trials as well as computerized cognitive testing and arterial spin labelling with MRI scans are included as exploratory measures. In October 2021, we announced the initial dosing of the first patient in the INTERCEPT-AD trial and the subsequent successful sentinel safety review of the first two patients. 
In January 2023, we submitted a protocol amendment to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to modify the planned dose level of Cohort 7 of INTERCEPT-AD to 25 mg/kg every two weeks from 60 mg/kg every two weeks. The proposed change was based in part on a blinded review of preliminary pharmacokinetic data, inclusive of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels, which indicated a dose of 60 mg/kg every two weeks should not be needed to attain central 
target engagement, and preliminary safety data, inclusive of two asymptomatic cases of ARIA-E (one in Cohort 4 after a single 60 mg/kg dose and one in Cohort 5 after a third 10 mg/kg dose). We announced the completion of enrollment in INTERCEPT-AD in February 2023 and we anticipate reporting topline data from this trial in the third quarter of 2023.
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that destroys memory and other important cognitive functions and ultimately leads to patient death. AD currently affects over 6 million people in the United States and approximately 32 million people worldwide and is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. However, due to the aging population, patient populations in the United States impacted by AD are expected to grow to approximately 13 million people by 2050 without effective preventative measures or safe and effective disease-modifying treatments. By 2050, healthcare costs for AD in the United States alone are estimated to exceed $1 trillion. The target population for ACU193 and other monoclonal antibodies in development is what is now being called “early AD.” This population includes people with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, or mild dementia due to AD who are also amyloid positive based on either imaging studies or cerebrospinal fluid biochemical analyses. The term “mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to AD” has also been used and is accepted by regulators as inclusion/exclusion criteria in clinical trials. While epidemiologic studies of this population are evolving, approximately 4-5 million people in the United States are likely to have early AD. 
In June 2021, the FDA granted approval for Biogen’s Aduhelm (aducanumab) under the FDA’s Accelerated Approval Pathway, or AAP. Aduhelm was the first new AD product approval since 2004 and the first approved disease-modifying product. In April 2022, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, released a final National Coverage Decision, or NCD, that restricts reimbursement for monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid for the treatment of AD, including Aduhelm, under a Coverage with Evidence Development, or CED, designation. The CED limits reimbursement of anti-amyloid antibodies, including Aduhelm, to placebo-controlled clinical trials. In May 2022, Biogen announced its decision to eliminate substantially all commercial support for Aduhelm in the U.S. and withdrew its marketing application for Aduhelm in Europe. 
In January 2023, the FDA granted approval for Eisai’s Leqembi™ (lecanemab) under the AAP based on results of its Phase 2 study. Lecanemab is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibrils) and insoluble (plaque) forms of amyloid beta. In September 2022, Eisai announced positive results of its lecanemab Phase 3 CLARITY-AD trial. In CLARITY-AD, lecanemab demonstrated highly statistically significant effects on primary and secondary clinical measures and a lower rate of ARIA than observed for aducanumab in the Phase 3 EMERGE and ENGAGE studies. Though a full FDA approval for Leqembi is anticipated for the third quarter of 2023 based on the Phase 3 CLARITY-AD results, the need for additional options for AD treatment and prevention becomes more urgent with each passing year, and we believe that our novel approach can potentially help address this pressing need.
Understanding the Foundation of Our Therapeutic Approach
While the pathology of AD was first described by Dr. Alois Alzheimer in 1906, the amyloid hypothesis was not developed until the Aß peptide was first identified as a major constituent of amyloid plaques in the 1980s. Historically, the primary hypothesis of decades of AD research, known as the amyloid hypothesis, held that AD dementia is the clinical consequence of Aß peptide monomers accumulating into extracellular amyloid plaques, or amyloid plaques, which in turn contribute to the formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of the tau protein and cause inflammation, ultimately leading to neuronal cell loss and progressive dementia. The primary constituent of amyloid plaques is the Aß peptide, although other proteins are present to lesser degrees. 
The amyloid hypothesis was more firmly established when a series of genetic mutations causing AD were discovered in the early to mid-1990s. These mutations were found in genes coding for the Amyloid Precursor Protein, or APP, and the genes coding for one of the enzymes which cleaves APP, creating the Aß peptide. Based on this hypothesis, a number of monoclonal antibodies currently or previously in clinical development for AD have primarily targeted either Aß monomers or amyloid plaques; for our purposes, this broadly defined class is referred to as anti-Aß/plaque antibodies. Several of these antibodies are currently in late-stage development, two having received accelerated regulatory approval, and collectively they have provided a biological foothold for treating AD. While aducanumab targets deposited amyloid plaques, lecanemab was intended to target soluble aggregated species of Aß known as protofibrils (although it also lowers plaque). However, the clinical data available to date indicate some of the potential limitations of these approaches with respect to clinically meaningful patient benefit and safety. 
Though alternative hypotheses to the amyloid hypothesis propose that amyloid accumulation is a consequence of another process such as infection, the field has now developed an understanding that three predominant pools of Aß species exist in vivo: Aß monomers (single Aß peptides), amyloid plaques (insoluble fibrillar Aß), and soluble AßOs (dimers and up to 200-mers). Some experts in the field differentiate soluble AßO oligomers into globular structures or linear protofibrils. Linear soluble protofibrils may elongate to form the insoluble fibrils that make up deposited amyloid plaques. ACU193 was developed to bind to globular AßOs rather than to Aß monomers or deposited amyloid plaques. The more recent appreciation of the crucial role of soluble AßOs in the pathologic process is the central tenet of our therapeutic approach.
Our therapeutic approach focuses on targeting AßOs, which we believe are the most toxic and pathogenic form of Aß relative to Aß monomers and insoluble amyloid plaques. Growing evidence, spurred by advances in AD research and analytic techniques, supports our view that AßOs are one of the primary instigators of AD neurodegeneration. AßOs have been observed to be potent neurotoxins that cause both acute synaptic toxicity and induce neurodegeneration. Experimentally in animal models, the accumulation of AßOs is associated with core AD neuropathology, including synapse deterioration and loss, tau hyper-phosphorylation, and inflammation. Research has also shown that the accumulation of AßOs is associated with AD-related behavioral deficits, such as learning and memory impairment. In light of this evidence, we believe that blocking the toxicity of AßOs is a promising approach for maximizing the therapeutic index (efficacy compared to safety) for the treatment of AD, which led us to discover and develop ACU193.
Our Product Candidate
Our product candidate, ACU193, is a recombinant humanized, affinity-matured, immunoglobulin G2, or IgG2, subclass monoclonal antibody, derived from the murine immunoglobulin G1, or IgG1, parent, ACU3B3. We are developing ACU193 for intravenous, or IV, administration every four weeks for the treatment of early AD. We believe that ACU193 represents a differentiated approach from current and prior anti-Aß/plaque immunotherapies because it is highly selective for soluble AßOs. ACU193 has a nanomolar affinity for AßOs, over 500-fold greater selectivity for AßOs over Aß monomers, and limited or no binding to dense core amyloid plaques. We believe that ACU193 is the most advanced immunotherapy candidate in development that was designed to selectively target AßOs.
We believe that ACU193 has characteristics that make it a promising potential treatment for AD relative to other antibodies that do not selectively target AßOs. ACU193 is designed to have reduce immune effector function signaling and to avoid binding to vascular amyloid plaques, which we expect will reduce the incidence of ARIA observed with amyloid plaque-targeting immunotherapies approved and in development for AD. We are currently assessing ACU193 in INTERCEPT-AD, a proof of mechanism Phase 1 clinical trial involving early AD patients. We anticipate our next clinical study, pending success in Phase 1, starting as a Phase 2 clinical trial with the potential to expand to a Phase 3 registration trial based in part on an interim expansion analysis. However, completion of a Phase 2 trial, with or without an expansion to Phase 3, will likely require us to raise capital in an amount sufficient to extend our cash runway into the second half of 2026.
Our Differentiated Approach to the Treatment of AD
We believe that, based on its differentiated mechanism of action, potential for symptomatic improvement and disease modification, and potential for higher dosing, ACU193 has several potential advantages in comparison to other AD drugs that are currently approved or in development: 
Differentiated mechanism of action:
•Potentially addresses an underlying cause of AD. A growing body of evidence indicates that AßOs, rather than Aß monomers or amyloid plaques, are the primary toxic species of Aß that impair neuronal synaptic function and contribute to impairment in memory and cognition and neurodegeneration. We believe that AßOs are an optimal therapeutic target relative to other Aß species and that ACU193 has the potential to be the first AßO mAb treatment to slow the progression of AD. 
•Selectively binds to AßOs. ACU193 is the first monoclonal antibody discovered and designed to selectively target AßOs. In our nonclinical studies, ACU193 demonstrated a greater than 500-fold affinity to bind to AßOs over monomers and did not bind vascular amyloid or dense core amyloid plaques. In immunohistochemical studies using human AD brain tissue, little or no binding to thioflavin-S positive amyloid plaques appeared to be present. In comparison, most other non-selective anti-Aß/amyloid antibodies in development bind primarily to Aß monomers or amyloid plaques.
•Binds to a broad spectrum of toxic AßOs. AßOs are present in the brain in a wide range of sizes. ACU193 has the ability to bind to a broad spectrum of toxic AßOs across various molecular weights. Nonclinical data shows that ACU193 binds to oligomeric species from dimers to approximately 100-mers of Aß. 
Potential for symptomatic improvement and disease modification:
•May provide symptomatic improvement in addition to disease modification. While recent anti-Aß monoclonal antibody results have established a biological foothold for disease-modifying treatments for AD, they fail to demonstrate clinically meaningful symptomatic improvement as measured by AD clinical assessments. Recent nonclinical studies show that AßOs are acutely toxic to neuronal function. By selectively targeting and neutralizing AßO toxicity, we believe that ACU193 has the potential to build upon this biological foothold and provide improvements in cognitive function in addition to disease-modifying effects.
Potential for higher dosing:
•Selectivity for AßOs could result in reduced rates of ARIA, allowing a broader therapeutic window. Amyloid plaque binding antibodies have been associated with ARIA, with IgG1 monoclonal antibodies in particular showing elevated rates of ARIA, which presents a safety concern. In contrast, ACU193 was developed as an IgG2 subclass monoclonal antibody, which has reduced inflammatory effector functions compared to IgG1 antibodies. Because ACU193 exhibits limited or no binding to amyloid plaques and has reduced inflammatory effector functions, we believe that treatment with ACU193 could result in lower rates of ARIA-E relative to IgG1 monoclonal antibodies that bind to amyloid plaque. ACU193 has demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in nonclinical studies. Based on the results of Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, safety studies in rats and monkeys, dose-ranging for the INTERCEPT-AD study included doses up to 60 mg/kg, and based on ongoing blinded safety reviews, the ARIA rate to date has been low. While certain anti-plaque antibodies have dose limitations due to ARIA, we believe that ACU193 may be well-tolerated at higher doses compared to other antibodies.
Figure 1: Summary comparison of ACU193 to anti-Aß/plaque antibodies in clinical development
Despite recognition that AßOs are key structures contributing to AD memory dysfunction, cognitive deficits, and neurodegeneration, drug discovery efforts targeting these species have been hampered by technical difficulties of generating physiologically relevant preparations of synthetic AßOs, or syn-AßOs. Our founders and early-stage researchers were instrumental in the development of well-characterized preparations of syn-AßOs, initially termed Aß Derived Diffusible Ligands, or ADDLs, which are globular structures. ADDL preparations were used as the immunogen to generate and discover ACU3B3, the murine IgG1 parent of ACU193. 
In December 2003, we entered into an exclusive license and research and development collaboration agreement with Merck for the research, discovery, development, and commercialization of immunotherapies for AD. From 2003 to 2011, Merck carried out extensive research leading to the humanization of ACU3B3 and creation of ACU193. ACU193 emerged as the lead product candidate based on its preferential AßO binding, favorable immunogenicity profile, and an absence of off-target binding. In 2011, Merck chose to terminate the program largely based on internal strategic priorities. Consequently, we regained an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license for the research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of ADDL antibodies, ADDL antigens, or products, including ACU193.
Clinical Development Plan
We are currently conducting INTERCEPT-AD, a U.S.-based, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of ACU193 in 65 patients with early AD. The early AD patient group is comprised of individuals who have mild dementia or MCI due to AD, and our trial excludes patients with moderate to severe AD dementia. Patients have been enrolled across seven cohorts, consisting of a single ascending dose in Part A and an overlapping multiple ascending dose in Part B. Part A contains Cohorts 1 through 4; each cohort received a single IV dose between 2mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, or placebo. Part B contains Cohorts 5 through 7; each cohort receives a total of three doses of ACU193 or placebo as follows: 10 mg/kg every four weeks (Q4W), 60 mg/kg Q4W, or 25 mg/kg every two weeks (Q2W). 
Figure 2: Design of INTERCEPT-AD
Trial Design Part A - Single Ascending Dose 
In Part A of our clinical trial, participants were randomized in a 6:2 ratio into one of four cohorts to receive a single dose of ACU193 or placebo as follows: 
•Cohort 1: One IV dose of ACU193 (2 mg/kg) or placebo. 
•Cohort 2: One IV dose of ACU193 (10 mg/kg) or placebo.
•Cohort 3: One IV dose of ACU193 (25 mg/kg) or placebo.
•Cohort 4: One IV dose of ACU193 (60 mg/kg) or placebo.
The double-blind treatment period for Cohorts 1-4 of Part A was approximately 20 weeks and included ten visits (four inpatient and six outpatient). A sequential dosing scheme was followed for each cohort in Part A. Dosing of Cohorts 1-3 began at least one week after all participants in the immediately preceding lower-dose cohort had received one administration of study drug and safety data had been reviewed by our internal blinded safety team. Dosing of Cohort 4 began at least one week after all participants in Cohort 3 received one administration of study drug and these safety data, along with Cohort 2 aggregate pharmacokinetic data, had been reviewed by our internal blinded safety team. An unblinded, 
independent Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, also monitored the trial and was able to review safety data on an ad hoc basis if requested by the blinded study team. 
Trial Design Part B - Multiple Ascending Dose
In Part B of our clinical trial, participants were randomized in an 8:2 ratio into one of three cohorts to receive a total of three doses of ACU193 or placebo as follows:
•Cohort 5: One IV dose of ACU193 (10 mg/kg) or placebo once every four weeks. 
•Cohort 6: One IV dose of ACU193 (60 mg/kg) or placebo once every four weeks. 
•Cohort 7: One IV dose of ACU193 (25 mg/kg) or placebo once every two weeks. 
Participants in Cohorts 5 and 6 will be evaluated over approximately 35 weeks, consisting of a seven-week screening period followed by a 28-week, double-blind treatment period. A follow-up safety check will be performed approximately eight weeks after the final visit of the double-blind treatment period.
Participants in Cohort 7 will be evaluated over approximately 31 weeks, consisting of a seven-week screening period, followed by a 24-week, double-blind treatment period. A follow-up safety check will be performed approximately eight weeks after the final visit of the double-blind treatment period. 
In order to maintain participant safety for Part B of the clinical trial, dosing of Cohort 5 began at least one week after all participants in Cohort 2 of Part A had received one administration of ACU193 or placebo and the Cohort 2 safety data had been reviewed by our internal blinded safety team. For Cohort 6, dosing began at least one week after all participants in Cohort 4 of Part A had received one administration of ACU193 or placebo and the Cohort 4 safety data had been reviewed by our internal blinded safety team. Dosing of Cohort 7 began after review of Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 safety data at least one week after the last person in the cohort was dosed. If a potential safety signal, an unexpected adverse reaction, or higher than expected exposure had occurred, our internal blinded safety team would have notified the independent, unblinded DMC to review the safety and pharmacokinetic data and advise on dose escalation. Cohort 7 will allow for additional pharmacokinetic modeling to more accurately determine if every two-week dosing is necessary and if accumulation of ACU193 occurs with this dosing frequency. 
Endpoints 
Our goal for the Phase 1 trial is to establish clinical proof of mechanism of ACU193 in patients with early AD. The endpoints we will measure as part of this trial include: 
Primary Endpoint
•safety and immunogenicity, including assessment for ARIA; 
Secondary Endpoints and Exploratory Objectives
•pharmacokinetics in plasma;
•determination of CSF concentrations of ACU193; 
•evaluation of central target engagement as measured by levels of ACU193 AßO complex in CSF;
•evaluation of possible changes in concentration of biomarkers for AD in CSF or blood; 
•evaluation of possible changes in amyloid plaque load as determined by PET imaging; 
•exploratory evaluation of possible changes in cerebral blood flow as determined by MRI imaging, using Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) pulse sequence; and 
•exploratory evaluation of possible changes in cognitive, functional, and behavioral measures using computerized testing and standard clinical measures for AD.
The main objective of INTERCEPT-AD is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and target engagement of single and multiple ascending doses of ACU193 administered by intravenous infusions. Exploratory outcomes will include cognitive scales and computerized cognitive testing. Our goal is to establish clinical proof of mechanism of ACU193 in early AD patients in order to enable progression into an adaptive Phase 2/3 clinical trial. In October 2021, we announced the initial dosing of the first patient in the INTERCEPT-AD trial and the subsequent successful sentinel safety review of the first two patients. Due to delays in clinical trial site activation and patient enrollment that we believe are principally related to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded the anticipated number of trial sites to support our enrollment objectives and anticipated timelines. We announced enrollment completion in February 2023 and anticipate reporting our topline data from this trial in the third quarter of 2023. Following, and subject to the results of, INTERCEPT-AD, we plan to request an end-of-Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA, which we anticipate will occur in the fourth quarter of 2023, to discuss the clinical trial design for our next clinical study and potential pathway for registration. The FDA granted Fast Track designation to ACU193 in October 2022. 
Nonclinical and Laboratory Data 
In nonclinical studies, ACU193 has demonstrated promising characteristics that indicate its potential to inhibit AßOs as a possible therapeutic treatment of AD. ACU193 has high selectivity, with over 500-fold binding selectivity for AßOs compared to Aß monomers and has limited or no binding to amyloid plaques. ACU193 binds to a broad spectrum of small to large soluble AßOs. Additionally, ACU193 has been shown to offer protection from synaptic toxicity by inhibiting binding of AßOs to primary hippocampal neurons. ACU193 has also demonstrated suitable in vivo pharmacology, target engagement, blood-brain barrier penetration and reduction of behavioral deficits. Based on nonclinical studies, AßO target engagement has the potential to be achieved at doses of ACU193 that will be tested in our Phase 1 clinical trial. Lastly, Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, toxicity studies conducted in two animal species supported the Phase 1 study. We believe these data indicate that ACU193 has the potential to offer patients a reduction in cognitive decline. 
Summary of Nonclinical Studies
In our nonclinical studies, ACU193 has demonstrated: (i) preferential selectivity for binding to AßOs versus other forms of Aß monomers and amyloid plaques in in vitro assays, human AD tissue samples and in vivo transgenic mouse models; (ii) consistent data in support of ACU193 protective effects against AßO synaptic toxicity in in vitro and ex vivo assays; (iii) in vivo pharmacology in multiple species confirming blood-brain barrier penetration, target engagement, and behavioral effects; and (iv) safety data in multiple species including GLP toxicology studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys confirming an adequate safety margin for the first in human clinical trial. Based on the strength of the data we observed in our nonclinical studies, we initiated INTERCEPT-AD, a Phase 1 clinical trial, in the second quarter of 2021.
Key Characteristics and Data

Selectivity | •ACU193 binds a broad range of synthetic and human-derived AßOs (~dimers to ~100-mers). 
In vivo pharmacology | •ACU193 crosses the blood-brain barrier and demonstrates dose-dependent target engagement in the brain following peripheral administration of antibody. 
Safety | •GLP studies via IV route established no observed adverse effect level, or NOAEL, of 300 mg/kg/dose in a 14-week cynomolgus monkey study and 250 mg/kg/dose in a 28-day rat study.

Selectivity for AßOs 
In order to understand ACU193 selectivity for AßOs, we performed biochemical assays and immunohistochemistry experiments. 
Selectivity for AßOs versus Aß monomers
We demonstrated that ACU193 shows significant preferential selectivity for AßOs compared to Aß monomers. In a competition ELISA assay, ACU193’s binding to AßOs was 556-fold greater than binding to Aß monomers. Figure 3A shows comparative syn-AßO versus Aß monomer affinity data for ACU193, and illustrates the high selectivity of ACU193 for AßOs. Further evidence of ACU193 selectivity for syn-AßOs was obtained using a very high concentration of monomeric Aß, 5 µm, which did not decrease binding to syn-AßOs (Figure 3B). We believe ACU193’s selectivity for AßOs in the presence of abundant Aß monomers is representative of the in vivo levels of these Aß species in AD patients. 
Thus, ACU193 does not experience “target distraction” from non-toxic Aß monomers in an environment simulating brain interstitial fluid. 
Figure 3: [A] Competitive ELISA for ACU193 binding to syn-AßO or monomeric Aß40 [B] 5µM monomeric Aß did not substantially change binding to syn-AßO
These results support the conclusion that selectivity of ACU193 for AßOs is maintained in a biochemical environment simulating the brain. 
Selectivity for AßOs versus amyloid plaques
We have shown in our nonclinical data that ACU193 binds AßOs from AD patients with limited or no binding to amyloid plaques. In Figure 4 below, thioflavin S-positive ß-amyloid plaques are shown in green fluorescence while ACU193 binding is shown in red fluorescence. ACU193 binds significantly in regions that are thioflavin-S-negative, i.e., without 
amyloid plaques (Figure 4, Panels B and E), but only infrequently and minimally binds to thioflavin-S-positive fibrillar Aß structures (Figure 4, Panel D); close examination shows possible co-localization of ACU193 with thioflavin-S-positive Aß deposits in their periphery (Figure 4, Panel F). We believe a likely explanation of ACU193 infrequent binding near the periphery of some amyloid plaques is due to binding to AßOs that surround the periphery of amyloid plaques. Taken together, these results are consistent with the concept that ACU193 binds endogenous AßOs, does not block binding by thioflavin-S, and, importantly, preferentially binds AßOs versus fibrillar Aß. 
Figure 4: ACU193 binding to AßOs versus amyloid plaques 
The upper left portion of the immunohistochemistry figure shows that in areas with no amyloid plaque binding (no green fluorescence staining, A) there is substantial binding by ACU193 (red fluorescence staining, B) that is not related to amyloid plaque. The merge of these panels (Panel E) shows ACU193 binding with no amyloid plaque present. On the upper right portion of the figure, the area that is positive for amyloid plaque (green fluorescence staining, C) shows minimal ACU193 binding (red fluorescence staining, Panel D). The merge of these panels (F) shows the minimal binding of ACU193 (red fluorescence staining) on the periphery of the amyloid plaque (green fluorescence staining), likely related to AßO binding in the halo of the amyloid plaque. 
Figure 5: AD stages based on AD neuropathic change, or ADNC, scoring
ADNC scoring is a combination of amyloid plaque levels, neuritic plaque levels, and neurofibrillary tangle pathology, or NFT, levels (Braak stage). In human tissue samples, ACU193 shows a disease state-relevant signal based on 
immunohistochemistry shown on the left from aged controls, intermediate AD pathology, and advanced AD pathology. On the far-right panel, ACU193 detects AßOs in soluble hippocampal extracts from an autosomal dominant AD patient, but not from a cognitively normal patient. 
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that ACU193 does not bind to amyloid plaque surrounding blood vessels (cerebral amyloid angiopathy). In a study of transgenic mice, we did not observe binding to vascular amyloid, in contrast to hu3D6 (bapineuzumab), which displayed significant binding at all dose levels.
Figure 6: ACU193 versus hu3D6 binding to vascular amyloids 
ACU193 (A and C) shows no binding to the vascular amyloid that is visible in the vessels stained by thioflavin-S (green fluorescence, B and D) in the brain 24 hours following IV dosing of 10 or 50 mg/kg in seven- to eight-month-old Tg2576 mice. In contrast, hu3D6 (bapineuzumab) binds vascular amyloid (E) at all dose levels assessed. 
The data above related to vascular plaque binding support our belief that ACU193 is likely to have limited ARIA liability. Given that the amyloid plaque-binding properties of multiple antibodies have been associated with ARIA (e.g., aducanumab, lecanemab, gantenerumab, and donenamab), we believe that ACU193’s negligible binding of amyloid plaques, including amyloid plaques associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, provides evidence that ACU193 may have a lower rate of ARIA in comparison. 
Binding to a broad spectrum of molecular weight AßOs 
In addition, we demonstrated that ACU193 binds a broad spectrum of AßOs across various molecular weights. In another series of experiments, syn-AßOs were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and characterized by ELISA using ACU193, hu3D6 (bapineuzumab) or hu266 (solanezumab) as the capture antibody and biotinylated anti-human Aß antibody 82E1 for detection. These data show ACU193 binds AßOs ranging from dimers to approximately 100-mers, with preferential binding to mid-molecular weight oligomers compared to hu266. This range of sizes is very similar to the range of sizes of oligomers thought to be most toxic. 
Figure 7. Binding of humanized antibodies to size exclusion chromatography fractions of synthetic Aß species
Size exclusion chromatography fractionation of syn-AßO prep with sandwich ELISA detection. hu3D6 is also known as bapineuzumab; hu266 is also known as solanezumab. These data demonstrate the specificity of ACU193 for oligomers versus monomers, and also demonstrate a range of oligomers that are bound by ACU193.
Collectively the data show that ACU193 binds AßOs with 556-fold selectivity versus Aß monomers and demonstrates limited to no binding to amyloid plaques, but does bind to a broad range of synthetic and endogenous low, mid, and higher molecular weight AßOs. Based on these and other data, we believe that ACU193 can target therapeutically relevant AßOs in the brain of early AD patients. 
Protection from AßO-induced synaptic toxicity 
In order to understand ACU193’s ability to either neutralize or limit AßO-induced physiological changes, we performed ex vivo studies using brain slices or cell cultures. 
Prevention of AßO toxic effects on neuronal electrophysiology
In ex vivo studies using the murine hippocampal slice long term potentiation, or LTP, model, pre-incubation with ACU193 or ACU3B3 has been shown to prevent the LTP deficit caused by AßOs (formed by administration of 50nM Aß1-42). LTP is an electrophysiological phenomenon demonstrated in neurons that may be associated with memory formation and other important neurological functions. Disruption of LTP has been associated with animal models in a variety of central nervous system disease states. 
Figure 8. Effects of ACU3B3 and ACU193 on AßO-induced change in LTP 
Note that AßOs disrupted normal LTP findings, but that pre-incubation with ACU3B3 prevented that disruption. 
Prevention of toxic effects of AßOs on calcium homeostasis 
Exposure to ACU3B3 has been shown to prevent calcium overload in cortical neuronal cultures induced by direct application of syn-AßOs (Figure 9). Disruptions in calcium homeostasis that cause cellular dysfunction have been implicated in a number of disease states, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Further, AßOs have been shown to cause disruption of calcium homeostasis, and thus, restoration of intracellular calcium to normal levels could serve as a functional indicator of potential treatment effect in AD. Multiphoton microscopy was used to examine the relationship of syn-AßO and neuronal calcium homeostasis in vitro (Figure 9). Direct application of syn-AßOs elicited calcium elevations in cortical neuronal cultures. Prior exposure to antibodies ACU3B3 and 3D6 prevented this calcium elevation (Figure 9). These results demonstrate that syn-AßOs induce elevated concentrations of intracellular neuronal calcium and that ACU3B3 prevented the syn-AßO-induced calcium overload. 
Figure 9: Effect of ACU3B3 on calcium homeostasis 
The relationship of syn-AßO and neuronal calcium homeostasis in the presence and absence of ACU3B3 was studied in primary cultures of transgenic APP-PS1 mouse cortical neurons. Multiphoton microscopy was used to obtain images of neuronal cultures at 12-14 days in vitro, or DIV, or 21 DIV. Cortical regions were identified and reimaged before and after topical applications of syn-AßOs to allow comparison of resting calcium within the same neuronal compartments. After baseline calcium was obtained, the cultures were treated with antibody-immunodepleted syn-AßOs (1 mL of 3 nM syn-AßOs with 9 µg of antibody) or syn-AßOs alone for 45 minutes. The cultures were then re-imaged in the same areas in the dish. Taken together, these studies show that ACU3B3 prevents the toxic effect of AßOs on calcium homeostasis. 
In Vivo Pharmacology 
In order to understand the effects of ACU193 in intact animals, we performed behavioral studies in transgenic mice with genetic alterations that overproduce a mutant amyloid precursor protein that forms amyloid plaques. The transgenic mouse models are generally based on autosomal dominant mutations in the APP gene causing rare forms of human AD. Transgenic mouse models using these mutations may not cause the full spectrum of AD pathology, but they do provide relevant animal models for drug development in AD. 
In vivo behavioral studies in multiple transgenic mouse models for AD
The behavioral studies described below, performed at three different laboratories, indicate in vivo central pharmacologic activity of peripherally administered ACU3B3. The behavioral effects seen in these studies indicate that sufficient amounts of ACU3B3 cross the blood-brain barrier to engage the target, resulting in behavioral improvements in these transgenic mice. The Phase 1 clinical trial includes doses in the range used in these nonclinical studies. 
A study conducted at QPS and using nine- to ten-month-old APP/SL transgenic mice treated weekly with 20 mg/kg ACU3B3 for four weeks demonstrated statistically significant behavioral improvements in swim path length and swim speed during the water maze learning test (Figure 10).
Figure 10: Results of ACU3B3 treatment in mice study
ACU3B3 treatment in nine- to ten-month-old APPSL mice (n=10/group) improves performance on the first day of water maze training (A; p=0.057), decreases swim path length (B; p=0.034), and reverses a swim speed abnormality (C; p<0.02).
In a separate study conducted at Stanford University, the hyperactivity phenotype of five- to seven-month-old Thy1-hAPP/SL transgenic mice in the open field and Y-maze tests was also significantly reduced after four to five weeks of treatment with ACU3B3 (20 and 30 mg/kg, weekly). Prior to dosing, Thy1-hAPP/SL mice showed increased activity in the activity chamber compared to wild-type mice. After treatment with ACU3B3, Thy1-hAPP/SL mice activity fell to a level 
comparable to wild-type mice, particularly activity in the center of the test arena (Figure 11A). Similar effects of ACU3B3 were found with changes in Y-maze behavior (Figure 11B) and passive avoidance (Figure 11C).

In separate studies conducted at the Gladstone Institute in young three- to five-month-old hAPP/J20 mice, behavioral abnormalities in these mice were reduced after chronic treatment with ACU3B3. Treatment ameliorated the hyperactivity phenotype, emotional response alterations and procedural learning deficits in this mouse model and hyperactivity in the Y-maze test was reduced dose-dependently (5 < 10 = 20 mg/kg) (Figure 12).

Taken together, these behavioral studies, performed at three different laboratories, indicate in vivo central pharmacologic activity of peripherally administered ACU3B3. The behavioral effects seen in these studies indicate that sufficient amounts of ACU3B3 cross the blood-brain barrier to engage the target, resulting in behavioral improvements in these transgenic mice. The range of doses used in these nonclinical studies are expected to be covered in INTERCEPT-AD. 
Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
ACU193 has demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics based on a number of nonclinical studies. ACU193 could be detected in plasma, CSF, and brain tissue of Tg2576 mice, rats, dogs, and rhesus monkeys following IV injection. Penetration of ACU193 into the brain was demonstrated by direct measurements of brain levels in Tg2576 mice, rats, and dogs, and by measurements of CSF levels in rats and rhesus monkeys. Brain levels were approximately 0.02% of plasma levels and CSF levels ranged from 0.05 to 0.15% of plasma levels, showing penetration of ACU193 into the brain. Toxicokinetic data collected as part of GLP toxicity studies in Sprague Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys showed clearance of 1 to 3 mL/h/kg and terminal half-life of approximately seven days. 
Brain penetration and in vivo binding of ACU193 was explored in seven-month-old Tg2576 mice dosed intravenously with 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg of ACU193 or hu3D6 (bapineuzumab), and perfused brain tissue was collected 24 hours after dosing for analysis. A dose dependent increase in brain levels of ACU193 (Figure 14A) and ACU193/AßO complex (Figure 14B) was demonstrated, with a minimum effective dose for target engagement of 10 mg/kg. 
Figure 14: Levels of ACU193 and AßO/ACU193 complexes in the brain 24 hours following IV dosing in seven-month-old Tg2576 mice (n = 4/cohort)
These results show ACU193 can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and bind endogenous AßOs. 
Additionally, a study of pharmacokinetics in CSF was conducted in rhesus monkeys. An intrathecal catheter was implanted in the monkeys, and two doses at 20 mg/kg IV were administered. As shown in Figure 15, the concentrations of ACU193 in CSF should provide adequate target engagement with dosing every four weeks.
Figure 15: Comparison of ACU193 levels in rhesus CSF to CSF Levels of AßO in human AD patients

Following two doses of 20 mg/kg ACU193 CSF concentrations were sufficient to provide target engagement at 28 days. An estimate of 1 fmole/mL for oligomer concentration is conservative given that it is based on AßOs consisting of trimers. 
Safety Profile 
GLP studies using IV administration of ACU193 established a no-observed-adverse-effect level, or NOAEL, of 250 mg/kg/dose, which was the maximum feasible dose, given every two weeks in a 28-day study in Sprague-Dawley rats. The NOAEL in cynomolgus monkeys was 300 mg/kg/dose in a 14-week study in cynomolgus monkeys using IV dosing every two weeks. In Sprague Dawley rats, no adverse findings were noted. In the 14-week study in cynomolgus monkeys, doses of 60, 300, or 600 mg/kg/dose ACU193 once every two weeks were administered. Three animals administered the highest 600 mg/kg/dose were sacrificed early for humane reasons on Days 43 or 60 due to ACU193-related, anaphylactoid-type reactions. 
Thus, the 300 mg/kg/dose is considered the NOAEL for cynomolgus monkeys. The NOAELs of 300 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg compare favorably to the highest dose of ACU193 being used in our Phase 1 clinical trial (60 mg/kg). 
Based in part on binding to AßOs rather than amyloid plaque, ACU193 has the potential to have a lower rate of ARIA than plaque-clearing anti-amyloid antibodies. Additionally, ACU3B3 showed no apparent increased risk of microhemorrhage when administered in vivo for three months in aged Tg2576 mice, as compared with 3D6, a plaque binding antibody used as a positive control. 
With regard to effector function and possible inflammatory effects generally, ACU193 is an IgG2 subclass antibody which has limited inflammatory effector function signaling compared to other IgG subclasses.
Combination Potential
While we believe ACU193, if successful, will likely be a foundational treatment for people with early AD, it also could be used as part of a combination treatment regimen. The pathology of AD is complex, and many experts in the field expect that combination therapy using drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as tau, immune modulation, glial cells such as microglia and astrocytes, and growth factors, will ultimately prove most successful, similar to cutting edge approaches used in oncology. In addition, because symptomatic treatments, such as memantine and cholinesterase inhibitors, affect neurotransmitter systems rather than the underlying AD pathology, we believe that it is likely that they will be used together with disease-modifying treatments.
Manufacturing
We do not currently own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing. We contract with third parties for the manufacture of ACU193. Because we rely on contract manufacturers, we employ personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience. Our staff has strong project management discipline to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulation that imposes various procedural and documentation requirements and that governs record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, and more. Our systems and our contractors are required to be in compliance with these regulations, and compliance is assessed regularly through monitoring of performance and a formal audit program. 
Our current supply chains for ACU193 involve several manufacturers that specialize in specific operations of the manufacturing process, including raw materials manufacturing, drug substance manufacturing and drug product manufacturing. We currently operate under work order programs for ACU193 with master services agreements in place that include specific supply timelines, volume and quality specifications. We believe our current manufacturers have the scale, the systems, and the experience to supply our currently planned clinical trials.
Competition
We face competition from several different institutions, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research institutions, governmental organizations and universities developing novel therapies for AD. We believe that the key factors affecting the clinical and commercial success of ACU193 will include safety profile, efficacy, cost, method of administration, level of marketing activity, insurance reimbursement and intellectual property protection. 
If approved, ACU193 can be used in combination with therapies currently approved for the treatment of AD which treat the symptoms of AD rather than the underlying cause of the disease, such as memantine and cholinesterase inhibitors. 
ACU193 may compete with one or more potentially disease-modifying therapeutics that target Aß or amyloid plaques, the most advanced of which are Biogen Inc.’s Aduhelm (aducanumab), which was given accelerated approval by FDA in June 2021, and Eisai’s Leqembi (lecanemab), which was given accelerated approval by FDA in January 2023. FDA issued a complete response letter to Eli Lilly and Company in January 2023 for the accelerated approval submission of donanemab. Eisai filed for full approval of Leqembi in January 2023; however, Biogen has not filed for full approval of Aduhelm. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have stated they would not reimburse for a drug given an accelerated approval by FDA for Alzheimer’s disease outside of a clinical trial. Roche Holding AG (gantenerumab) announced negative results from their Phase 3 study in November 2022, and Eli Lilly and Company (donenamab) is anticipated to complete its Phase 3 study in 2023. 
Other companies known to be developing therapies with Aß, AßO-, and amyloid plaque-related targets include AltPep Corporation, Alzheon, Inc., Alzinova AB, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Cognition Therapeutics, Inc., Grifols, S.A., KalGene Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neurimmune AG, Novartis AG, ProMIS Neurosciences, Inc., Prothena Biosciences, Inc., Vaxxinity, Inc., Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. and Wren Therapeutics, Inc. Additionally, ACU193, if approved, may also compete with other potential therapies intended to address underlying causes of AD that are being developed by several companies, including AbbVie Inc., AC Immune SA, Alector, Inc., Anavex Life Sciences Corp., Annovis Bio, Inc., Athira Pharma, Inc., Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cassava Sciences, Inc., Denali Therapeutics, Inc., Johnson & Johnson (including Janssen, its wholly-owned subsidiary) and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.

A potential limitation of the amyloid plaque-targeting antibodies under development is an adverse effect known as ARIA. ARIA has two different forms, ARIA-E, or cerebral edema, formerly called vasogenic edema, and ARIA-H, or cerebral microhemorrhages. While the mechanism of ARIA is not known with certainty, the prevailing theory is that ARIAs are related to the presence of amyloid plaques around blood vessels in the majority of people with AD, a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy. It is generally believed that the removal of these amyloid plaques by the antibody can result in small hemorrhages, or ARIA-H. ARIA-H occurs in individuals with untreated AD and its occurrence is increased in individuals treated with antibodies that target amyloid plaques. Increased ARIA-H is correlated with worsening cognition. In contrast to ARIA-H, ARIA-E is hypothesized to result from the leakage of fluid from the blood vessels into the interstitial spaces in the brain, causing an effusion or edema, ARIA-E. ARIA-E, in particular, is sometimes associated with symptoms that include worsening of cognition, headache, gait disturbance and seizures, which can be severe enough to lead to hospitalization. ARIA-E usually resolves weeks to months following the cessation of treatment. In clinical trials for anti-Aß/plaque mAbs, surveillance MRI scans are required to detect asymptomatic ARIA. Table 2 below illustrates the rates of ARIA observed in Phase 2 or 3 studies for the most advanced mAbs.

Additional Treatment Modalities
While Aß and amyloid are generally considered to be the proximal cause of AD pathology, and alternative hypotheses to the amyloid hypothesis propose that amyloid accumulation is a consequence of other processes such as infection and that other pathogens lead to amyloid accumulation, downstream targets such as tau, inflammation-related targets, and growth factors may eventually be useful approaches in the treatment of AD and are being explored. Some of these treatment modalities have made nonclinical and early-stage clinical progress, although these efforts are still significantly less advanced than those approaches targeting Aß or amyloid plaques. 
Collaboration Agreement with Merck 
In December 2003, we entered into an exclusive license and research and development collaboration agreement with Merck to research, discover and develop certain technology related to amyloid beta-derived diffusible ligands, or ADDL, which agreement was amended and restated in October 2006. The agreement generally provided that, during the course of the collaboration, Merck would be responsible for the preclinical and clinical development and commercialization of any products covered by the agreement and, in return, we were eligible to receive potential nonclinical, clinical and regulatory milestone payments and royalties on future product sales. During the collaboration, Merck developed ACU193, an ADDL 
antibody, and intellectual property related to ACU193 was filed by Merck. In 2011, Merck elected to voluntarily terminate the collaboration agreement. Pursuant to the surviving provisions of the agreement, effective upon termination of the collaboration, Merck granted us an exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license, with right to sublicense, under Merck’s interest in the patent rights and know-how necessary for the research, development, manufacturing or commercialization of ADDL antibodies, ADDL antigens or products, including ACU193. 
License Agreement with Lonza
On November 2, 2022, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the “Lonza License Agreement”) with Lonza Sales. Under the terms of the Lonza License Agreement, Lonza granted the Company a worldwide non-exclusive license to use Lonza’s glutamine synthetase gene expression system to manufacture and commercialize ACU193 (the “Product”).
Pursuant to the Lonza License Agreement, we paid Lonza an upfront fee of 1.0 million Swiss Francs. The Company is also required to pay certain royalties upon commercialization and annual payments on a country-by-country basis in respect of the manufacturing and sale of the Product, which include (i) a royalty of less than 1.0% on net sales where Lonza manufactures the Product, (ii) an annual royalty payment in Swiss Francs in the low six-digits and a royalty of less than 1.0% on net sales where the Company manufactures the Product and (iii) an annual payment in Swiss Francs in the mid six-digits per sublicense and a royalty on net sales in the low single digits where a third party manufactures the Product. These payment obligations would expire ten years from the first commercial sales of the Product in such country of sale.
The Lonza License Agreement continues until terminated, and the Company or Lonza may terminate the Lonza License Agreement for uncured material breaches or insolvency of the other party. The Company can unilaterally terminate the Lonza License Agreement with prior written notice to Lonza, and Lonza can also unilaterally terminate the Lonza License Agreement upon certain actions by the Company. The Lonza License Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties, indemnification and other obligations of the Company and Lonza.
Intellectual Property 
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidate. We also rely on the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
The main form of commercial exclusivity for our product candidate, ACU193, is expected to come from biologic regulatory exclusivity. We expect that once approved by regulatory agencies, ACU193 will receive the benefit of 12 years of market exclusivity in the U.S. and 10 to 11 years of data and market exclusivity in Europe, in each case, against competitors seeking approval for a biosimilar product. 
We have an exclusive license grant from Merck to patents claiming the composition and method of use of our product candidate, ACU193. The license grant arose from our collaboration agreement with Merck to research, discover, and develop technology related to ADDLs. During our collaboration, ACU193, an ADDL antibody, was developed and intellectual property was filed by Merck. In 2011, the collaboration agreement terminated and Merck exclusively licensed to Acumen, Merck’s interest in patent rights claiming ADDL antibodies, including ACU193, ADDL Antigens and/or Products to Acumen. In the nine years subsequent to the termination of the collaboration with Merck, Acumen has controlled and directed and continues to control and direct prosecution of the licensed ACU193 patent portfolio. Acumen has also paid for and continues to pay all costs and fees associated with the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed ACU193 patent portfolio. 
As of March 25, 2023, Acumen licenses from Merck one issued U.S. patent, 18 issued foreign patents including issued patents in Brazil, China, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, France, Germany and the UK drawn to our product candidate, ACU193. These patents are projected to expire in July of 2031, without taking into account any possible extensions and assuming payment of all appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees. 
Throughout the development of our product candidate, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including by protecting inventions related to additional methods of use, processes of making, formulation, and dosing regimens. 
Patent Term and Term Extensions 
The terms of individual patents are determined based primarily on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a U.S. patent can be extended to recapture a portion of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the restoration period cannot extend the patent term beyond 14 years from FDA approval for the product covered by that patent. In addition, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may receive the extension, and the extension applies only to coverage for the approved drug, methods for using it and methods of manufacturing it, even if the claims cover other products or product candidate. Where one patent covers multiple products or product candidate, it may only receive an extension for one of the covered products; any extension related to a second product or product candidate must be applied to a different patent. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application, such as a Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application. All taxes, annuities or maintenance fees for a patent, as required by the USPTO and various foreign jurisdictions, must be timely paid in order for the patent to remain in force during this period of time. 
The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions and the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
Our patents and patent applications may be subject to procedural or legal challenges by others. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
Trademarks and Know-How 
In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. We rely upon know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by our employees and through relationships with third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors, commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.” 
Government Regulation 
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
U.S. Biologics Regulation 
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements, or GLPs; 
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually and when certain changes are made; 
•approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose; 
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
•payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable; 
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and 
•FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or post-approval may subject an applicant to delays in development or approval, as well as administrative and judicial sanctions.
Preclinical and Clinical Trials
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. 
The FDA may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period, or while clinical trials are ongoing, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. Imposition of a clinical hold could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and effectiveness. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any protocol and 
subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. In addition, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives or that the trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk to subjects or on other grounds, such as lack of efficacy. 
Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
IND sponsors must submit annual reports on the progress of investigations under the IND to FDA and submit IND safety reports when certain serious and unexpected adverse reactions and certain other safety issues occur. 
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1-The investigational product is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dose response, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. 
•Phase 2-The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
•Phase 3-The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These trials are used to gain additional data from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate. 
BLA Submission and Review by the FDA 
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA. 
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. 
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, the development of adequate controls and specifications, or the completion of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and priority review. 
The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development, in addition to the potential for rolling review of the BLA, meaning that the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate. 
Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for priority review. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review). 
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Accelerated approval pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product candidate for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based on a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, signed by President Biden on December 29, 2022 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617) includes numerous reforms to the accelerated approval process for drugs and biologics and enables FDA to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval study be underway prior to granting accelerated approval. FDORA also expands the expedited withdrawal procedures already available to FDA to allow the agency to use expedited procedures if a sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval study of the product with due diligence including with respect to “conditions specified by the Secretary [of HHS].” FDORA also adds the failure of a sponsor of a product approved under accelerated approval to conduct with due diligence any required post-approval study with respect to such product or to submit timely reports with respect to such product to the list of prohibited acts in the FDCA.
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation, or ODD, to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States and when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. 
If a product that has received ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. 
Post-approval Requirements
Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and complying with advertising and promotion requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations applicable to biologics, including those prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Promotional materials for approved biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. 
After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
•safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
•clinical holds on clinical studies; 
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; and 
•the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
United States Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars in the United States. Biosimilarity requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. 
Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. 
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA remain subject to significant uncertainty. 
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include, without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security and physician and other health care provider transparency laws and regulations. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or arrangement for or recommendation of the purchase, lease, order or arrangement for any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly;
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act; 
•the federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable to Medicare or a state health program, unless an exception applies;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes which prohibit, among other things, a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates,” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, as well as analogous state 
and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; 
•the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to: (i) payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. 
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in federal and state funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, diminished profits and future earnings, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could harm our business.
Coverage and Reimbursement 
In the United States and in other countries, patients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE), commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. 
Third-party payors determine which products and procedures they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. 
Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that a procedure is safe, effective and medically necessary; appropriate for the specific patient; cost-effective; supported by peer-reviewed medical journals; included in clinical practice guidelines; and neither cosmetic, experimental nor investigational. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product and also have a material adverse effect on sales. 
Healthcare Reform
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each as amended, collectively known as the ACA, was enacted, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and changes to fraud and abuse laws. For example, the ACA: 
•increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; 
•required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; 
•required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
•imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs.
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is also unclear how other such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA or our business. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per year, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through fiscal year 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. 
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, proposed and enacted legislation and executive orders issued by the prior presidential administration designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
