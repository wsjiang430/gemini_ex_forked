Business Operations
 Company Summary 
 The Company is a mineral exploration company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of copper projects currently in Nevada, Alaska and Montana in the United States and British Columbia, Canada. The amounts shown as mineral properties represent acquisition costs incurred to date, less amounts recovered and/or written off, and do not necessarily represent present or future values. The underlying value of mineral properties and related capitalized costs are dependent on the existence of economically recoverable reserves, securing and maintaining title and beneficial interest in the properties, and obtaining necessary financing.
 The Company is an exploration stage issuer as defined in S-K 1300. Under S-K 1300, a mining company can be classified as an exploration stage issuer, a development stage issuer, or a production stage issuer. To be classified as a development stage issuer or production stage issuer, a company must have established mineral reserves, and the Company has not established mineral reserves as defined in S-K 1300.
 Environment
 We are committed to an approach we call "Conservation by Design," applying best practices, sound science, and state-of-the-art technology to the design and operation of our mining projects for minimal emissions and water conservation.
Social
 We are committed to creating opportunities and value for the communities in which we work by engaging with them early and often in the mining process.
Financing
 The Company ensures that sufficient funds are raised from equity offerings or debt financings to meet its operating requirements, after considering existing cash and expected exercise of stock options and share purchase warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company raised $2 million from private placements.

Competitive Conditions 
 The Company competes with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees, for supplies and equipment, as well as for capital. As a result of this competition in the mining industry, some of which is with large established mining companies holding substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours, we may be unable to effectively develop and operate mines or obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable. 
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Laws
 Our current and planned operations are subject to local, provincial, state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations provide strict standards for compliance, and potentially significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. These laws address emissions, waste discharge requirements, management of hazardous substances, protection of endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires significant time and expense, and future changes to these laws and regulations may cause material changes or delays in the development of mines or our future activities on site.
Employees
 As at January 1, 2023, we have eight full and part time employees and approximately twenty individuals working on a consulting basis. Our operations are managed by our officers with input from our directors. We engage geological, metallurgical, and engineering consultants from time to time as required to assist in evaluating our property interests and recommending and conducting work programs.
