Item 1. | Business.
------------+----------

Overview
 
We were incorporated in Nevada on December 13, 2000 as Vegas Petra, Inc. From that date until November 30, 2004, when we entered into a Plan of Merger with Digital Ally, Inc., a Nevada corporation which was formerly known as Trophy Tech Corporation (the “Predecessor Registrant”), we had not conducted any operations and were a closely-held company. In conjunction with the merger, we were renamed Digital Ally, Inc.
 
On January 2, 2008, we commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “DGLY.” We conduct our business from 14001 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, Kansas 66215. Our telephone number is (913) 814-7774. Our website address is www.digitalallyinc.com. The contents of, or information accessible through, our website are not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, as well as beneficial ownership filings available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such reports with, or furnish such reports to, the SEC. Our filings with the SEC are available to the public through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
 
On August 23, 2022 (the “Effective Time”), the Predecessor Registrant merged with and into its wholly owned subsidiary, DGLY Subsidiary Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Registrant”), pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of August 23, 2022 (the “Merger Agreement”), between the Predecessor Registrant and the Registrant, with the Registrant as the surviving corporation in the merger (such transaction, the “Merger”). At the Effective Time, Articles of Merger were filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, pursuant to which the Registrant was renamed “Digital Ally, Inc.” and, by operation of law, succeeded to the assets, continued the business and assumed the rights and obligations of the Predecessor Registrant immediately prior to the Merger. Under the Nevada Revised Statutes, shareholder approval was not required in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby.
 
At the Effective Time, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) each outstanding share of Predecessor Registrant’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Predecessor Common Stock”) automatically converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Registrant (“Registrant Common Stock”), (ii) each outstanding option, right or warrant to acquire shares of Predecessor Common Stock converted into an option, right or warrant, as applicable, to acquire an equal number of shares of Registrant Common Stock under the same terms and conditions as the original options, rights or warrants, and (iii) the directors and executive officers of the Predecessor Registrant were appointed as directors and executive officers, as applicable, of the Registrant, each to serve in the same capacity and for the same term as such person served with the Predecessor Registrant immediately before the Merger.
 
For the purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, (i) the term “our,” or “us” refers to the Predecessor Registrant and its subsidiaries with respect to the period prior to the Effective Time and to the Registrant and its subsidiaries with respect to the period on and after the Effective Time; (ii) as of any period prior to the Effective Time, references to the “directors” mean the directors of the Predecessor Registrant, and, as of any period at and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Registrant, (iii) as of any period prior to the Effective Time, references to “stockholders” mean the holders of Predecessor Common Stock, and, as of any period at and after the Effective Time, the holders of Registrant Common Stock, and (iv) as of any period prior to the Effective Time, references to “Common Stock” means the Predecessor Common Stock, and, as of any period at and after the Effective Time, Registrant Common Stock.
 
The business of the Registrant, Digital Ally, Inc. (with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Digital Ally International, Inc., Shield Products, LLC, Digital Ally Healthcare, LLC, TicketSmarter, Inc., Worldwide Reinsurance, Ltd., Digital Connect, Inc., BirdVu Jets, Inc., Kustom 440, Inc., and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC, collectively, “Digital Ally,” “Digital,” and the “Company”), is divided into three reportable operating segments: 1) the Video Solutions Segment, 2) the Revenue Cycle Management Segment and 3) the Entertainment Segment. The Video Solutions Segment is our legacy business that produces digital video imaging, storage products, disinfectant and related safety products for use in law enforcement, security and commercial applications. This segment includes both service and product revenues through our subscription models offering cloud and warranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and health safety solutions. The Revenue Cycle Management Segment provides working capital and back-office services to a variety of healthcare organizations throughout the country, as a monthly service fee. The Entertainment Segment acts as an intermediary between ticket buyers and sellers within our secondary ticketing platform, ticketsmarter.com, and we also acquire tickets from primary sellers to then sell through various platforms. The accounting guidance on Segment Reporting establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in financial statements. The following table sets forth the Company’s total revenue and the revenue derived from each reportable operating segment:

Video Solutions Operating Segment
 
Within our video solutions operating segment we supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities for the law enforcement and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create positive solutions to our customers’ requests. Our products include: the EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite, which are in-car digital video systems for law enforcement and commercial markets; the FirstVu body-worn camera line, consisting of the FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, and the FirstVu HD; our patented and revolutionary VuLink product which integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation for both law enforcement and commercial markets; the FLT-250, DVM-250, and DVM-250 Plus, which are our commercial line of digital video mirrors that serve as “event recorders” for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets; and FleetVu and VuLink, which are our cloud-based evidence management systems. We further diversified and broadened our product offerings in 2020, by introducing two new lines of branded products: (1) the ThermoVu® which is a line of self-contained temperature monitoring stations that provides alerts and controls facility access when an individual’s temperature exceeds a pre-set threshold and (2) our Shield™ disinfectants and cleansers which are for use against viruses and bacteria.
 
Our video solutions segment revenue encompasses video recording products and services for our law enforcement and commercial customers and the sale of ShieldTM disinfectant and personal protective products. This segment generates revenues through our subscription models offering cloud and warranty solutions, and hardware sales for video and personal protective safety products and solutions. Revenues for product sales are recognized upon delivery of the product, and revenues from our cloud and warranty subscription plans are deferred over the term of the subscription, typically 3 or 5 years.
 
Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment
 
We entered the revenue cycle management business late in the second quarter of 2021 with the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, Digital Ally Healthcare, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary Nobility Healthcare, LLC (“Nobility Healthcare”). Nobility Healthcare completed its first acquisition on June 30, 2021, when it acquired a private medical billing company, and has since completed three more acquisitions of private medical billing companies, in which we assist in providing working capital and back-office services to healthcare organizations throughout the country. Our assistance consists of insurance and benefit verification, medical treatment documentation and coding, and collections. Through our expertise and experience in this field, we aim to maximize our customers’ service revenues collected, leading to substantial improvements in their operating margins and cash flows.

Our revenue cycle management segment consists of our medical billing subsidiaries. Revenues of this segment are recognized after we perform the obligations of our revenue cycle management services. Our revenue cycle management services are services, performed and charged monthly, generally based on a contractual percentage of total customer collections, for which we recognize our net service fees.
 
Entertainment Operating Segment
 
We have also entered into live entertainment and events ticketing services through the formation of our wholly owned subsidiary, TicketSmarter, Inc. (“TicketSmarter”) and its completed acquisitions of Goody Tickets, LLC and TicketSmarter, LLC, on September 1, 2021. TicketSmarter provides ticket sales, partnerships, and mainly, ticket resale services through its online ticketing marketplace for live events, TicketSmarter.com. TicketSmarter offers tickets for over 125,000 live events through its platform, for a wide range of events, including concerts, sporting events, theatres, and performing arts, throughout the country.
 
Our entertainment operating segment consists of ticketing services provided through TicketSmarter and its online platform, TicketSmarter.com. Revenues of this segment include ticketing service charges generally determined as a percentage of the face value of the underlying ticket and ticket sales from our ticket inventory which are recognized when the underlying tickets are sold. Ticketing direct expenses include the cost of tickets purchased for resale by the Company and held as inventory, credit card fees, ticketing platform expenses, website maintenance fees, along with other administrative costs.
 
Our Video Operating Segment Products and Services
 
Through our video operating segment we supply technology-based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities for the law enforcement and security industries and for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets. We have the ability to integrate electronic, radio, computer, mechanical, and multi-media technologies to create positive solutions to our customers’ requests. Our products include: the EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite, which are in-car digital video systems for law enforcement and commercial markets; the FirstVu body-worn camera line, consisting of the FirstVu Pro, FirstVu, and the FirstVu HD; our patented and revolutionary VuLink product integrates our body-worn cameras with our in-car systems by providing hands-free automatic activation for both law enforcement and commercial markets; the FLT-250, DVM-250, and DVM-250 Plus, which are our commercial line of digital video mirrors that serve as “event recorders” for the commercial fleet and mass transit markets; and FleetVu and VuLink, which are our cloud-based evidence management systems. We further diversified and broadened our product offerings in 2020, by introducing two new lines of branded products: (1) the ThermoVu® which is a line of self-contained temperature monitoring stations that provides alerts and controls facility access when an individual’s temperature exceeds a pre-set threshold and (2) our Shield™ disinfectants and cleansers which are for use against viruses and bacteria.
In-Car Digital Video Mirror System for Law Enforcement – EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite
 
In-car video systems for patrol cars are a necessity and have generally become standard. Current systems are primarily digital based systems with cameras mounted on the windshield and the recording device generally in the trunk, headliner, dashboard, console or under the seat of the vehicle.
 
The Company launched its in-car digital video platform under the name EVO-HD during the second quarter of 2019. The EVO-HD is a revolutionary in-car system that delivers versatility and reliability for law enforcement.

With built-in, patented auto-activation technology, EVO-HD captures multiple recording angles in sync from a FirstVu PRO or FirstVu HD body-worn camera and up to four HD in-car cameras – all from a single trigger. The EVO-HD maximizes space and offers top-end reliability when paired with remote service capabilities. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the VuVault.net cloud, powered by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and real time metadata when in the field.
 
The Company offers the DVM-800, a continuation in the family of highly successful digital video mirrored (DVM) systems developed by the Company. The DVM-800 is a time-tested, compact, powerful and easy-to-use solution designed for law enforcement. The DVM-800 system has built-in road and driver facing cameras and can record up to two external HD cameras. The DVM-800 is compatible with the patented VuLink® auto-activation technology and can be paired with a FirstVu HD body-worn camera.
 
The Company also offers the DVM-800 Lite, an entry level system is a self-contained video recorder, microphone and digital storage system that is integrated into a rear-view mirror and is designed for law enforcement. The system can record up to two internal HD cameras.
 
In-Car Digital Video “Event Recorder” System – DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 for Commercial Fleets
 
Digital Ally provides commercial fleets and commercial fleet managers with the digital video tools that they need to increase driver safety, track assets in real-time and minimize the company’s liability risk while enabling fleet managers to operate the fleet at an optimal level. We market a product designed to address these commercial fleet markets with our DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 event recorders that provide various types of commercial fleets with features and capabilities that are fully-customizable and consistent with their specific application and inherent risks.
 
The DVM-250 Plus is a part of the DVM family and is designed for commercial fleets featuring built-in digital audio and video recording technology and other features to provide commercial fleet managers unmatched driver and asset management – all while aiming to deliver the return on investment that matters most: the safety and security of drivers and passengers. The DVM-250 Plus is designed to capture events, such as wrecks and erratic driving or other abnormal occurrences, for evidentiary or training purposes. The commercial fleet markets may find our units attractive from both a feature and a cost perspective compared to other providers. Due to our marketing efforts, commercial fleets are beginning to adopt this technology, and in particular, the ambulance and taxi-cab markets.
 
In the first quarter of 2021, Digital Ally released the FLT-250, offering the same great features of the DVM-250 Plus in a new compact, non-mirrored form factor that allows for multiple mounting options in any vehicle type for commercial fleets. We believe that, due to non-mirror-based aspect of this product, the FLT-250 will become more attractive for our potential customers, as it is a much simpler plug and play option compared to mirror-based products.
 
Digital Ally offers a suite of data management web-based tools to assist fleet managers in the organization, archival, and management of videos and telematics information. Within the suite, there are powerful mapping and reporting tools that are intended to optimize efficiency, serve as training tools for teams on safety, and, ultimately, generate a significant return on investment for the organization.
 
We expect the EVO-HD to become the platform for a new family of in-car video solution products for the commercial markets. The innovative EVO-HD technology is expected to replace the current in-car mirror-based systems with a miniaturized system that can be custom-mounted in the vehicle, while offering numerous hardware configurations to meet the varied needs and requirements of our commercial customers. In its commercial market application, the EVO-HD can support up to four HD cameras, with two cameras having pre-event and ECA capabilities to allow customers to review entire shifts. An internal cell modem will allow for connectivity to the FleetVu Manager cloud-based system for commercial fleet tracking and monitoring, which is powered by AWS and real time metadata when in the field.
 
Body-Worn Digital Video System – FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, and FirstVu HD for Law Enforcement and Private Security
 
During 2021, Digital Ally launched two next generation body-worn cameras and docking stations, refreshing the Company’s complete ecosystem of evidence recording devices. The latest body worn camera launched by the Company is the FirstVu Pro, the Company’s flagship product in its family of next generation of technology. The light weight, one-piece unit captures full HD video and audio, while offering industry leading features such as live streaming, a full-color touchscreen display, an advanced image sensor with IR LEDs, proprietary image distortion reduction, IP67 rated resisting dust and wind and is water submersible for 30 minutes at a depth of 3 feet. It is also MIL-STD-810G compliant capable of handling drops, shock, and vibration, and will function flawlessly in a wide temperature range.

In addition to the FirstVu Pro, Digital Ally also added the FirstVu II to its family of next generation technology. The FirstVu II is a one-piece device offering industry leading technology such as an articulating camera head, a full-color display, an advanced image sensor, and GPS. It can be used in law enforcement, private and event security and commercial segments.
 
Digital Ally still carries the FirstVu HD, the two-piece body-worn camera which allows for multiple mounting options while minimizing space and weight. It can be used in law enforcement, private and event security and commercial segments. This system is also a derivative of our in-car video systems, but is much smaller and lighter and more rugged and water-resistant to handle a hostile outdoor environment. The FirstVu HD can be used in many applications in addition to law enforcement and private security and is designed specifically to be clipped to an individual’s pocket or other outer clothing. The unit is self-contained and requires no external battery or storage devices. Our FirstVU HD integrates with our in-car video systems through our patented VuLink system allowing for automatic activation of both systems.
 
With the newly introduced body-worn cameras, Digital Ally also introduced two new QuickVu docking stations compatible with the FirstVu PRO and FirstVu II body-worn cameras. The QuickVu docking stations provide a comprehensive and elegant solution for storing and charging body cameras while uploading video evidence to the cloud. QuickVu also allows for rapid reviewing of footage right from the interactive touchscreen display, and is available in eight or twenty-four individual docking bays. For docking with the FirstVu HD body-worn cameras, Digital Ally offers a 12-bay docking station and Mini-Docks. The 12-bay docking station includes a 1TB local memory hard drive which simultaneously upload 4 hours of video from 12 FirstVu HD cameras within a 15-minute shift change and push configuration updates. The Mini-Dock is a single unit, portable smart dock that uploads video evidence to VuVault from a FirstVu HD body camera.
 
Auto-activation and Interconnectivity Between In-car Video Systems and Body-worn Camera Products – VuLink for Law Enforcement
 
Recognizing a critical limitation in law enforcement camera technology, we pioneered the development of our VuLink ecosystem that provides intuitive auto-activation functionality as well as coordination between multiple recording devices. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”) has recognized these pioneering efforts by granting us multiple patents with claims covering a variety of triggers, including emergency lights and sirens, extreme acceleration or braking, g-force or any 12-volt relay. Additionally, the awarded patent claims cover automatic coordination between multiple recording devices. Prior to our VuLink ecosystem, officers had to manually activate each device while responding to emergency scenarios, a requirement that both decreased the usefulness of the existing camera systems and diverted officers’ attention during critical moments.
 
EVO Web and FleetVu Manager
 
EVO Web is a web-based software, powered by and hosted on the AWS GovCloud platform, that enables police departments and security agencies to manage digital video evidence quickly and easily. EVO Web is capable of playing back, reviewing, downloading, archiving, unit configuration and management, running customizable reports and maintaining a chain of custody logs. AWS is the most secure cloud platform on the market with features that go beyond simply storing and reviewing video evidence. AWS GovCloud platform is trusted by the Department of Justice, Defense Digital Services for the US Air Force, U.S. Department of Treasury, and U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Our products that are compatible with EVO Web include: FirstVu Pro, FirstVu II, FirstVu HD, QuickVu, EVO-HD, DVM-800 and DVM-800 Lite.
 
FleetVu Manager is a web-based software that provides commercial fleet managers with the tools to increase driver safety, track assets in real-time and minimize their companies’ liability risks. FleetVu Manager is able to generate driver reports, identify at risk behaviors before an incident takes place, and enable commercial fleet managers to manage the entire fleet through a single, easy to use platform. Our products compatible with FleetVu Manager include: DVM-250 and FLT-250.

Our entertainment operating segment also provides customers with access to tickets which it has purchased or received in return for its sponsorship or partnership from the venue, event or owner.
 
Market and Industry Overview – Video Solutions Operating Segment
 
Our video solutions segment has historically had a primary market of domestic and international law enforcement agencies. We have since expanded our scope by pursuing the commercial fleet vehicle and mass transit markets. Additionally, we have expanded into event security services where we provide the hardware and software to supplement private security for NASCAR races, football and other sporting events, concerts and other events where people gather. We continue to further expand our focus on private security, homeland security, mass transit, healthcare, general retail, educational, general consumer and other commercial markets. In that regard, we have several installations involving private security on cruise ships and similar markets. We believe there are many potential private uses of our product offerings. We continue to have sales in the commercial fleet and ambulance service provider market, confirming that our DVM-250 Plus and FLT-250 products and FleetVu Manager can become a significant revenue producer for us. Additionally, our body-worn cameras have applications in law enforcement, along with private and event security, as well as commercial segments. With the recent acquisitions we completed in 2021, we hope to utilize the connections we now have to live events, stadiums, and arenas, as well as new medical connections.

Market and Industry Overview – Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment
 
Our revenue cycle management segment consists of end-to-end revenue cycle management services that focuses on claim reimbursement billing, verification, and related services to medical providers throughout the country. We offer agreements with customers in which we provide our services and bill the customers monthly for our services. The healthcare industry in the United States represents a strong portion of the United States’ economy, offering a robust market for these services. Our current market includes many diverse specialties, including radiology, oncology, orthopedics, pediatrics, internal medicine, and cardiology. We continue to investigate ways to expand our market reach, although can make no assurances in that regard.
Market and Industry Overview – Entertainment Operating Segment
 
Our entertainment segment refers to the sale of event tickets primarily through our online and mobile platforms. We will buy inventory of event ticket to then sell tickets through various platforms, including our own. Our resale services refer to the sale of tickets by a holder, who originally obtained the tickets directly from a venue or entity, through our platform in which we then collect services fees on the transaction. This is commonly referred to as secondary ticketing. We work directly with consumers looking to buy or sell event tickets for particular shows, concerts, games, and other events, allowing a simple and effective platform to move tickets. We also currently partner with more than 35 collegiate conferences, over 300 universities, and hundreds of events and venues.
Competition - Video Solutions Operating Segment
 
Our video solutions segment, consisting of law enforcement and security surveillance markets, is extremely competitive. Competitive factors in these industries include ease of use, quality, portability, versatility, reliability, accuracy and cost. There are direct competitors with technology and products in the law enforcement and surveillance markets for all of our products, including those that are in development. Many of these competitors have significant advantages over us, including greater financial, technical, marketing and manufacturing resources, more extensive distribution channels, larger customer bases and faster response times to adapt new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. Our primary competitors in the in-car video systems market include L-3 Mobile-Vision, Inc., Coban Technologies, Inc., Enforcement Video, LLC d/b/a WatchGuard Video (“WatchGuard”), Kustom Signals, Panasonic System Communications Company, International Police Technologies, Inc. and a number of other competitors who sell, or may in the future sell, in-car video systems to law enforcement agencies. Our primary competitors in the body-worn camera market include Axon Enterprises, Inc. (“Axon”), Reveal Media, WatchGuard, and VieVU, Inc., which was acquired by Axon in 2018. We face similar and intense competitive factors for our event recorders in the commercial fleet and private security markets as we do in the law enforcement and security surveillance markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in these markets. Further, there can be no assurance that new and existing companies will not enter the law enforcement and security surveillance markets in the future. The commercial fleet security and surveillance markets likewise are also very competitive. There are direct competitors for our FLT-250 and DVM-250 Plus “event recorders,” which may have greater financial, technical marketing, and manufacturing resources than we do. Our primary competitors in the commercial fleet sector include Lytx, Inc. (previously DriveCam, Inc.) and SmartDrive Systems, among others.

Competition – Revenue Cycle Management Operating Segment
 
Our revenue cycle management segment is a highly competitive market that is only intensifying as the market continues to grow. We face competition from a variety of sources, including internal revenue cycle management departments within healthcare organizations, as these organizations are beginning to make internal investments in these departments to keep these services in house. Additionally, other revenue cycle management providers exist and offer similar services through software vendors, traditional consultants, and information technology sources.
Competition – Entertainment Operating Segment
 
Our entertainment segment faces robust competition from several sources throughout the industry. As the online and mobile ticketing market continues to increase, it has allowed for more technology-based companies to offer ticketing services and systems. The online environment consists of numerous other websites and platforms for all markets. With the market continuing to grow, resale marketplaces and websites can reach a vastly larger audience with more convenient access to tickets for a wide variety of events. We continue to build our brand and recognition, through the numerous partnerships and sponsorships throughout the country, in attempt to become a preferred platform for consumers.
Worldwide Reinsurance Ltd.
 
In December 2021, the Company formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Worldwide Reinsurance Ltd. (“Worldwide Re”), a Bermuda incorporated captive insurance company that will provide primarily liability insurance coverage to the Company for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today’s insurance marketplace.
 
Worldwide Re is subject to capital and other regulatory requirements imposed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”). Although these capital requirements are generally less constraining than U.S. capital requirements, failure to satisfy these requirements could result in regulatory actions from the BMA or loss of or modification of Worldwide Re’s Class 1 insurer license, which could adversely impact our ability to support our insurance needs and to grow this business into another line of business for our holding company. To date, our captive’s relatively immature claims history limits the predictive value of estimating the costs of incurred and future claims. Accordingly, the captive could continue to incur significant fluctuations in financial results as the captive provides insurance coverage to Digital Ally and its affiliated businesses and seeks to expand beyond our affiliated companies to offer coverage for third parties.
 
Intellectual Property – Video Solutions Operating Segment
 
Our video solutions operating segment’s ability to compete effectively will depend on our success in protecting our proprietary technology, both in the United States and abroad. We have filed for patent protection in the United States and certain other countries to cover certain design aspects of our products.
 
Some of our patent applications are still under review by the USPTO and, therefore, we have not yet been issued all the patents that we applied for in the United States. We were issued several patents in recent years, including a patent on our VuLink product that provides automatic triggering of our body-worn camera and our in-car video systems. No assurance can be given which, or any, of the patents relating to our existing technology will be issued from the United States or any foreign patent offices. Additionally, no assurance can be given that we will receive any patents in the future based on our continued development of our technology, or that our patent protection within and/or outside of the United States will be sufficient to deter others, legally or otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing our technologies.
 
We have entered into supply and distribution agreements with several companies that produce certain of our products, including our DVM-250 and DVM-800 products. These supply and distribution agreements contain certain confidentiality provisions that protect our proprietary technology, as well as that of the third-party manufacturers.
 
In addition to seeking patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to seek to achieve and thereafter maintain a competitive advantage. Although we have entered into or intend to enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that we will be able to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.
