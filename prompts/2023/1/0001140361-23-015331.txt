Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
The Company is an ultrasound and shock wave technology company using patented systems of noninvasive, high-energy, acoustic shock waves or low intensity and non-contact ultrasound for regenerative medicine and other applications. Our focus is regenerative medicine utilizing noninvasive, acoustic shock waves or ultrasound to produce a biological response resulting in the body healing itself through the repair and regeneration of tissue, musculoskeletal, and vascular structures. Our two primary systems are UltraMIST® and PACE®. UltraMIST and PACE are the only two Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved directed energy systems for wound healing.
 
The UltraMIST system provides, through a fluid mist, low-frequency, non-contact, and pain free ultrasound energy deep inside the wound bed that promotes healing from within. The ultrasound acoustic waves promote healing by reducing inflammation and bacteria in the wound bed, while also increasing the growth of new blood vessels to the area. The UltraMIST system treatment must be administered by a healthcare professional. This proprietary technology has been cleared by the FDA for the promotion of wound healing through wound cleansing and maintenance debridement combined with ultrasound energy deposited inside the wound that stimulated tissue regeneration.
 
The PACE systems, use acoustic waves generated by the Company’s Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE) technology to converge at precise selected targets to produce an extremely short duration compression burst. The precise targeting of tissue with PACE® technology provides healthcare professionals with a tool to positively influence cellular form and function, which can result in pain relief, improved circulation, and tissue regeneration. The PACE® system treatment must be administered by a healthcare professional. The Company sells three PACE systems including:
 

• | dermaPACE®: Used to treat Diabetic Foot Ulcers and other chronic wounds
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | orthoPACE®: Used to treat acute musculoskeletal conditions
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Profile: Used to provide therapeutic treatment of musculoskeletal conditions
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our portfolio of wound treatment solutions provides patients with a noninvasive technology that boosts the body’s normal healing and tissue regeneration processes. The Company is marketing its UltraMIST and PACE systems for usage primarily in the United States.
 
Regarding the non-contact and non-thermal low frequency ultrasound UltraMIST system, the Company is focused on the following:
 

• | Growth and expansion of sales across the United States
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Improvement of the functionality and ease-of-use for both medical personnel and patients
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Find antibacterial and anti-biofilm solutions to replace the saline solution used to produce the mist used by this system to conduct the ultrasound toward its target, which, the Company believes would make the system more effective in treating bacterial infections associated with skin conditions 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Design new applicators capable of treating large skin conditions, for improved efficiency in such cases.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company is focused on further developing our PACE proprietary technology to activate healing in:
 

• | Acute and chronic wound conditions, including diabetic foot ulcers, venous and arterial ulcers, pressure sores, burns and other skin eruption conditions;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Orthopedic applications, such as eliminating chronic pain in joints from trauma, arthritis or tendons/ligaments inflammation or tendinopathies, speeding the healing of fractures (including nonunion or delayed-union conditions), improving bone density in osteoporosis, fusing bones in the extremities and spine, and other potential sports injury applications; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plastic/cosmetic applications such as cellulite smoothing, graft and transplant acceptance, skin tightening, scarring and other potential aesthetic uses; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cardiovascular applications for removing plaque due to atherosclerosis, eliminating occlusions and blood clots, and improving heart muscle and cardiac valves performance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to healthcare uses, our high-energy, acoustic pressure shock waves, due to their powerful pressure gradients and localized cavitational effects, may have applications in secondary and tertiary oil exploitation, for cleaning industrial waters and food liquids, unclogging pipes and filtration systems, and finally for maintenance of industrial installations and underwater structures by disrupting biofilms formation and eliminating fouling. The Company intends to pursue these opportunities through licensing and/or partnership opportunities.
 



The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity, which has been further impacted by the war in Ukraine and related sanctions.  Due to the combination of the COVID-19 slowdown and the war in the Ukraine, the Company has experienced a disruption of our supply channels during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. Also, the pandemic caused continued or additional actions by hospitals and clinics such as limiting elective procedures and treatments and limiting clinical trial activities and data monitoring. These factors have had a negative impact on our sales and our results of operations.
 
UltraMIST - Ultrasound Healing Therapy
 
UltraMIST is an FDA approved powerful, non-contact, non-thermal ultrasound therapy system used to promote healing in a wide range of wound types. The system never touches the wound surface making it pain free.  UltraMIST promotes wound healing below the surface by modulating cell membranes to drive increased blood flow and capillary formation. It also reduces and removes a wide range of bacteria, including biofilms, while preserving healthy structures. UltraMIST is FDA approved to treat malaises such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, venous leg ulcers, deep tissue pressure injuries, and surgical wounds.
 
PACE Technology for Regenerative Medicine
 
Our PACE system candidates, including our dermaPACE System, deliver high-energy acoustic pressure shock waves to produce compressive and tensile stresses on cells and tissue structures. These mechanical stresses at the cellular level have been shown in pre-clinical work to promote angiogenic and positive modulated inflammatory responses, and quickly initiate the healing cascade. This has been shown in pre-clinical work to result in microcirculatory improvement, including increased perfusion and blood vessel widening, the production of angiogenic growth factors, enhanced new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) and the subsequent regeneration of tissue such as skin, musculoskeletal and vascular structures. PACE procedures trigger the initiation of an accelerated and modulated inflammatory response that speeds wounds into proliferation phases of healing and subsequently returns a chronic condition to an acute condition to help reinitiate the body’s own healing response. The Company believes our PACE technology is well suited for various applications due to its activation of a broad spectrum of cellular events critical for the initiation and progression of healing.
 
Currently, there are limited biological or mechanical therapies available to activate the healing and regeneration of skin, musculoskeletal tissue, and vascular structures. As baby boomers age, the incidence of their targeted diseases and musculoskeletal injuries and ailments will be far more prevalent. The Company believes that our pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that our PACE technology will be effective in targeted applications. The Company anticipates that future clinical studies should lead to regulatory approval of our regenerative product candidates in the Americas, Middle East and Africa. If approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities, the Company believes that our product candidates will offer new, effective, and noninvasive (extracorporeal) treatment options in wound healing, orthopedic injuries, plastic/cosmetic uses and cardiovascular procedures, improving the quality of life for millions of patients suffering from injuries or deterioration of tissue, bones and vascular structures.
 
dermaPACE – Our Wound Care Shockwave Product
 
The Company is focused on the development of products that treat unmet medical needs in large market opportunities. Our FDA approval in the United States for our, dermaPACE system is the first step in providing an option to a currently unmet need in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Diabetes is common, disabling, and deadly. In the United States, diabetes has reached epidemic proportions. Based on our research, foot ulcerations are one of the leading causes of hospitalization in diabetic patients and lead to billions of dollars in health care expenditures annually. dermaPACE is noninvasive and does not require anesthesia, making it a cost-effective, time-efficient, and painless approach to wound care. dermaPACE’s noninvasive treatments are designed to elicit the body’s own healing response and followed by simple standard of care dressing changes, are designed to allow for limited disruption to the patients’ normal lives and have no effect on mobility while their wounds heal.
 
DermaPACE has received the European CE Mark approval to treat acute and chronic defects of the skin and subcutaneous soft tissue, such as in the treatment of pressure ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and traumatic and surgical wounds. The dermaPACE is also licensed for sale in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea. Additionally, our joint venture partner in Brazil, Diversa SA, received approval from the Brazilian Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (“National Health Surveillance Agency” or “ANVISA”) to market dermaPACE to treat diabetic foot ulcers in Brazil.
 
Developing Product Opportunities - Orthopedic
 
The orthoPACE system, which is intended for use in orthopedic, trauma and sports medicine indications, continues to be a viable and effective treatment solution in Europe and South Korea. The system features four types of applicators including a unique applicator that is less painful for some indications and may reduce or eliminate anesthesia for some patients. In the orthopedic setting, the orthoPACE system is being used to treat tendinopathies and acute and nonunion fractures, including the soft tissue surrounding the fracture to accelerate healing and prevent secondary complications and their associated treatment costs. Common examples of these injuries include extremity joint pain, torn rotator cuffs (shoulder), tennis elbow, Achilles’ tendon tears and torn meniscus cartilage in the knee. Injuries to these structures are very difficult to treat because the body has a limited natural ability to regenerate these kinds of tissues.  Prior investigations and pre-clinical work indicate that PACE can positively affect the body’s inflammatory process and activate various cell types and may be an important adjunct to the management of sports medicine injuries. The Company plans to submit to the FDA a 510(k) seeking clearance for general indications to address this growing field.
 



Additionally, the Company has developed and introduced Profile by SANUWAVE as an immediately available solution for pain management in sports medicine and physical therapy in the U.S. market. Profile by SANUWAVE is a therapeutic massager intended for the relief of minor muscle aches and pains via SANUWAVE’s Diffused Acoustic Pressure (DAP®) technology. DAP® delivers the beneficial, therapeutic field of the acoustic pressure waves without the impact and potential pain of a focused pulse. There is a significant need in the U.S. for pain management products and the Company believes the non-invasive delivery of therapeutic shockwaves for its treatment can help to serve this market.
 
Non-Medical Uses for Our Shockwave Technology
 
The Company believes there are also significant opportunities for our acoustic pressure shockwave technology in non-medical uses, including in the energy, water, food, and industrial markets.
Market Trends
 
The Company is focused on the development of regenerative medicine products that have the potential to address substantial unmet clinical needs across broad market indications. The Company believes there are limited therapeutic treatments currently available that directly and reproducibly activate healing processes in the areas in which the Company is focusing, particularly for wound care and repair of certain types of musculoskeletal conditions.
 
With the success of negative pressure wound therapy devices in the wound care market over the last decade and the recognition of the global epidemic associated with certain types of wounds, as well as deteriorating musculoskeletal conditions attributed to obesity, diabetes, vascular and heart disease, as well as sports injuries, the Company believes that Medicare and private insurers have become aware of the high costs and expenditures associated with the adjunctive therapies being utilized for wound healing and orthopedic conditions that have limited efficacies in full skin closure, or bone and tissue regeneration. The Company believes the wound healing and orthopedic markets are undergoing a transition, and market participants are interested in biological response activating devices that are applied noninvasively and seek to activate the body’s own capabilities for regeneration of tissue at injury sites in a cost-effective manner.
 
Strategy
 
Our strategy is focused on the commercialization of our patented, non-invasive, and biological response-activating medical systems for the repair and regeneration of skin, musculoskeletal tissue, and vascular structures. Our wound care portfolio of regenerative medicine products and product candidates help restore the body’s normal healing processes, by activating biologic signaling and angiogenic responses.
 
The key elements of our strategy include the following:
 

• | Commercialize and support the domestic distribution of our UltraMIST and PACE systems to treat wounds;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduce and normalize operating costs to support growth;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop and commercialize our noninvasive biological response activating devices in the regenerative medicine area for the treatment of skin, musculoskeletal tissue, and vascular structures; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support the global distribution of our products.
--+-------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing upon our proprietary rights. The Company seeks to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing United States and selected foreign patent applications and United States and selected foreign trademark applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, products, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.
Patents
 
The Company considers the protection afforded by patents important to our business. The Company intends to seek and maintain patent protection in the United States and select foreign countries, where deemed appropriate for products that the Company develops. In general, our patents are effective ranging from 6 months to 16 years.  There are no assurances that any patents will result from our patent applications, or that any patents that may be issued will protect our intellectual property, or that any issued patents or pending applications will not be successfully challenged, including as to ownership and/or validity, by third parties. In addition, if the Company does not avoid infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, the Company may have to seek a license to sell our products, defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of intellectual property in court. Any current or future challenges to our patent rights, or challenges by us to the patent rights of others, could be expensive and time consuming.
 
The Company believes that our owned and licensed patent rights provide a competitive advantage with respect to others that might seek to utilize certain of our apparatuses and methods incorporating extracorporeal acoustic pressure shockwave technologies that the Company has patented. However, the Company does not hold patent rights that cover all of our products, product components, or methods that utilize our products. The Company also has not conducted a competitive analysis or valuation with respect to our issued and pending patent portfolio in relation to our current products and/or competitor products.
 
Under our license to HealthTronics, Inc., the Company reserves exclusive rights in our purchased portfolio as to orthopedic, tendinopathy, skin wounds, cardiac, dental, neural medical conditions and to all conditions in animals (the “Ortho Field”). HealthTronics receives field-exclusive and sublicensable rights under the purchased portfolio as to (1) certain HealthTronics lithotripsy devices in all fields other than the Ortho Field, and (2) all products in the treatment of renal, ureteral, gall stones and other urological conditions (the “Litho Field”). HealthTronics also receives non-exclusive and non-sublicensable rights in the purchased portfolio as to any products in all fields other than the Ortho Field and Litho Field.
 



Pursuant to mutual amendment and other assignment-back rights under the patent license agreement with HealthTronics, the Company are also a licensee of certain patents and patent applications that have been assigned to HealthTronics. The Company received a perpetual, non-exclusive and royalty-free license to nine issued foreign patents. Our non-exclusive license is subject to HealthTronics’ sole discretion to further maintain any of the patents and pending applications assigned back to HealthTronics.
 
The Company operates in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation. If the Company becomes involved in future litigation or any other adverse intellectual property proceeding, for example, as a result of an alleged infringement, or a third party alleging an earlier date of invention, the Company may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and, in the event of an adverse ruling, the Company could be subject to liability for damages, including treble damages, invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation or lengthy governmental proceedings and could divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous, if available at all.
 
Trademarks
 
Since other products on the market compete with our products, the Company believes that our product brand names are an important factor in establishing and maintaining brand recognition.
The Company has the following trademark registrations: SANUWAVE® (United States, European Community, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Taiwan and under the Madrid Protocol), dermaPACE® (United States, European Community, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, Canada, China, Brazil, Mexico, and under the Madrid Protocol), angioPACE® (European Community and United Kingdom), PACE® - Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (United States, European Community, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Canada), orthoPACE® (United States, United Kingdom, and European Community), DAP® - Diffused Acoustic Pressure (United States and European Community), and Profile® (United States, European Community, and United Kingdom). Our newest trademark is Energy First® (United States), Healing Today, Curing Tomorrow® (United States), and UltraMIST® (United States).
 
Through the acquisition of UltraMIST®/MIST assets from Celularity Inc., the Company is now the owner of the Celleration® (United States, Australia, Europe Community, and Japan), Proven Healing® (Madrid Protocol, European Community, and United Kingdom), MIST Ultrasound Healing Therapy & Design® (United States), MIST® (United States), MIST Therapy® (United States), and MIST & Design® (United States) registered trademarks.
 
The Company also maintains trademark registrations for: OssaTron® (United States), OSWT® (Switzerland) Evotron® (United States, Germany and Switzerland), Evotrode® (United States, Germany and Switzerland), Orthotripsy® (United States). The Company phased out the OssaTrode® (United States, Germany and Switzerland), Equitron® (United States and Switzerland). Reflectron® (Germany and Switzerland) and Reflectrode® (Germany and Switzerland), evoPACE® (Canada, Australia, European Community and Switzerland) trademarks, due to the fact that OssaTrode®, Equitron®, Reflectron® and Reflectrode® products are no longer available for sale in any market and evoPACE® is a product that was never commercialized.
 
Competition
 
The Company believes the advanced wound care market can benefit from our technology which up-regulates the biological factors that promote wound healing. Current medical technologies developed by Acelity L.P. Inc, (formerly Kinetic Concepts, Inc.) now owned by 3M, Organogenesis, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc, Derma Sciences, Inc., MiMedx Group, Inc., Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Molnlycke Health Care, and Systagenix Wound Management (US), Inc. (now owned by Acelity) and Softwave Tissue Regeneration Technologies, manage wounds, but, in our opinion, do not provide the value proposition to the patients and care givers like our PACE technology has the potential to do. The leading medical device serving this market is the Vacuum Assisted Closure (“V.A.C.”) System marketed by KCI. The V.A.C. is a negative pressure wound therapy device that applies suction to debride and manage wounds.
 
There are also several companies that market extracorporeal shockwave device products targeting lithotripsy and orthopedic markets, including Dornier MedTech, Storz Medical AG, Electro Medical Systems (EMS) S.A., Softwave Tissue Regneration Technologies, and CellSonic Medical which could ultimately pursue the wound care market. Nevertheless, the Company believes that the PACE systems have a competitive advantage over all of these existing technologies by achieving wound closure by means of a minimally invasive process through innate biological response to PACE technology.
 
Regarding the companies that use low frequency ultrasound that creates a pressure wave producing micro-strains due to mechanical forces that deform cell membrane and therefore promote healing, there are technologies developed by Arobella Medical LLC, NanoVibronix, Chattanooga, and EDAP TMS to manage wound care.  However, these treatment devices or medical systems are different in design and mode of application of the ultrasound when compared to SANUWAVE’s UltraMIST.  The Company believes that UltraMIST has a competitive advantage over all of these existing technologies, due to broad medical indications, simplicity of use, wound healing results and the tolerability of the treatment by the patients, especially for painful wounds.
 



Developing and commercializing new products is highly competitive. The market is characterized by extensive research and clinical efforts and rapid technological change. The Company faces intense competition worldwide from medical device, biomedical technology and medical products and combination products companies, including major pharmaceutical companies. The Company may be unable to respond to technological advances through the development and introduction of new products. Most of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources. These competitors may also be in the process of seeking FDA or other regulatory approvals, or patent protection, for new products. Our competitors may commercialize new products in advance of our products. Our products also face competition from numerous existing products and procedures, which currently are considered part of the standard of care. To compete effectively, our products will have to achieve widespread market acceptance.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
FDA Regulation
 
Each of our products must be approved or cleared by the FDA before it is marketed in the United States. Before and after approval or clearance in the United States, our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or the Public Health Service Act, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, record-keeping, market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices and pharmaceutical products.
    In the United States, the FDA subjects medical products to rigorous review. If the Company does not comply with applicable requirements, the Company may be fined, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or to allow us to manufacture or market our products, and the Company may be criminally prosecuted. Failure to comply with the law could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a product candidate, product recall, product seizure, interruption of production, operating restrictions, suspension or withdrawal of product approval, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.
 
The FDA has determined that our technology and product candidates constitute “medical devices.” The FDA determines what center or centers within the FDA will review the product and its indication for use, and determines under what legal authority the product will be reviewed. For the current indications, our products are being reviewed by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. However, the Company cannot be sure that the FDA will not select a different center and/or legal authority for one or more of our other product candidates, in which case the governmental review requirements could vary in some respects.
 
FDA Approval or Clearance of Medical Devices
 
In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and efficacy:
 

• | Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class II: special controls, pre-market notification (510(k)), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, and post market surveillance, and additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class III: special controls and approval of a pre-market approval (PMA) application.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Each of our product candidates require FDA authorization prior to marketing, by means of either a 510(k) clearance or a PMA approval. To request marketing authorization by means of a 510(k) clearance, the Company must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed medical device, has the same intended use, and is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a legally marketed device. 510(k) submissions generally include, among other things, a description of the device and its manufacturing, device labeling, medical devices to which the device is substantially equivalent, safety and biocompatibility information, and the results of performance testing. In some cases, a 510(k) submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence only when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any product modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, or that would constitute a significant change in intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, if the device would no longer be substantially equivalent, would require a PMA. If the FDA determines that the product does not qualify for 510(k) clearance, then a company must submit, and the FDA must approve, a PMA before marketing can begin.
 



A PMA application must provide a demonstration of safety and effectiveness, which generally requires extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data. Information about the device and its components, device design, manufacturing, and labeling, among other information, must also be included in the PMA. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with quality system regulation requirements, which govern testing, control, documentation, and other aspects of quality assurance with respect to manufacturing. The PMA approval can include post-approval conditions, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, or requirements to do additional clinical studies post-approval. Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement is required to authorize certain modifications to the device, its labeling, or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
 
Obtaining medical device clearance, approval, or licensing in the United States or abroad can be an expensive process. International fee structures vary from minimal to substantial, depending on the country. In addition, the Company is subject to annual establishment registration fees in the United States and abroad. Device licenses require periodic renewal with associated fees as well. In the United States, there is an annual requirement for submitting device reports for Class III/PMA devices, along with an associated fee. Currently, the Company is registered as a Small Business Manufacturer with the FDA and as such are subject to reduced fees. If, in the future, our revenues exceed a certain annual threshold limit, the Company may not qualify for the Small Business Manufacturer reduced fee amounts and will be required to pay full fee amounts.
 
Post-Approval Regulation of Medical Devices
 
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

• | the FDA quality systems regulation, which governs, among other things, how manufacturers design, test, manufacture, exercise quality control over, and document manufacturing of their products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and claims regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires reporting to the FDA of certain adverse experiences associated with use of the product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post market surveillance, including documentation of clinical experience and follow-on, confirmatory studies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company continues to be subject to inspection by the FDA to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements, as are our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and contract testing laboratories.
 
International sales of medical devices manufactured in the United States that are not approved or cleared by the FDA are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Exported devices may also fall under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Commerce/Bureau of Industry and Security and compliance with export regulations may be required for certain countries.
 
 Manufacturing Certifications
 
The Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) – allows a single regulatory audit of a medical device manufacturer’s quality management system to satisfy the requirements of multiple regulatory authorities (RAs). Five RAs: The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Brazil’s Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA), Health Canada, MHLW/PMDA (Japan), and the FDA participated in a three-year MDSAP Pilot which concluded in December 2016. These RAs will continue to participate in MDSAP as the program moved into its operational phase starting January 2017, with Health Canada making a full transition from the Canadian Medical Devices Conformity Assessment System (CMDCAS) to MDSAP.
 
MDSAP uses recognized third-party auditors – auditing organizations (AOs) – to conduct a single quality management system audit that satisfies the requirements of multiple regulatory authorities. Manufacturers only needed to comply with the regulations from the jurisdictions where they sell their products. The MDSAP certificate indicates that a manufacturer complies with the regulatory requirements for the markets defined in the certificate. The certificate does not represent marketing authorization, nor does it require any regulatory authority to issue a marketing authorization or endorsement to the device manufacturer.
 
The Company has been certified to the MDSAP requirements for all five participating countries, most recently successfully completing a MDSAP recertification audit in September 2022.  This certificate is valid for three years.  Annual surveillance audits are required to maintain this certification.





Manufacturing cGMP Requirements
 
Manufacturers of medical devices are required to comply with FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) set forth in the quality system regulations promulgated under section 520 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facility for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA pursuant to a pre-PMA approval inspection before the Company can use it. The Company and some of our third-party service providers are also subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations, and civil and criminal penalties. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or in product withdrawal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following the approval.
International Regulation
    We are subject to regulations and product registration requirements in many foreign countries in which we may sell our products, including in the areas of product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import and export restrictions and tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. The time required to obtain clearance required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance, and requirements for licensing a product in a foreign country may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
United States Anti-Kickback and False Claims Laws
 
In the United States, there are Federal and state anti-kickback laws that prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of healthcare products and services. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in Federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA as medical devices, such as us, and hospitals, physicians, and other potential purchasers of such products. Other provisions of Federal and state laws provide civil and criminal penalties for presenting, or causing to be presented, to third-party payers for reimbursement, claims that are false or fraudulent, or which are for items or services that were not provided as claimed. In addition, certain states have implemented regulations requiring medical device and pharmaceutical companies to report all gifts and payments over $50 to medical practitioners. This does not apply to instances involving clinical trials. Although we intend to structure our future business relationships with clinical investigators and purchasers of our products to comply with these and other applicable laws, it is possible that some of our business practices in the future could be subject to scrutiny and challenge by Federal or state enforcement officials under these laws.
Third Party Reimbursement
 
We anticipate that sales volumes and prices of the products we commercialize will depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers. Third party payers include governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans, and workers’ compensation plans. Even though a new product may have been approved or cleared by the FDA for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until adequate history of reimbursement has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers.
    In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines and procedures. There can be no assurance that procedures using our products will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that our products will be considered cost-effective by third party payers, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be available or that the third-party payers’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.
 
We believe that the overall escalating costs of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. In addition, recent healthcare reform measures, as well as legislative and regulatory initiatives at the Federal and state levels, create significant additional uncertainties. There can be no assurance that third party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or reimbursement policies of third-party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payer coverage or reimbursement would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 



Confidentiality and Security of Personal Health Information
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (HIPAA), contains provisions that protect individually identifiable health information from unauthorized use or disclosure by covered entities and their business associates. The Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the agency responsible for enforcing HIPAA, has published regulations to address the privacy (the “Privacy Rule”) and security (the “Security Rule”) of protected health information (PHI). HIPAA also requires that all providers who transmit claims for health care goods or services electronically utilize standard transaction and data sets and to standardize national provider identification codes. In addition, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act enacted the HITECH Act, which extends the scope of HIPAA to permit enforcement against business associates for a violation, establishes new requirements to notify the Office for Civil Rights of HHS of a breach of HIPAA, and allows the Attorneys General of the states to bring actions to enforce violations of HIPAA.
 
We anticipate that, as we expand our PACE business, we may in the future be a covered entity under HIPAA. We have adopted policies and procedures to comply with the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule and the HIPAA statute as such regulations become applicable to our business.  We currently don’t capture patient data through our PACE system.
 
In addition to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule described above, we may become subject to state laws regarding the handling and disclosure of patient records and patient health information. These laws vary widely. Penalties for violation include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure as well as civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, private individuals may have a right of action against us for a violation of a state’s privacy laws. We intend to adopt policies and procedures to ensure material compliance with state laws regarding the confidentiality of health information as such laws become applicable to us and to monitor and comply with new or changing state laws on an ongoing basis.
 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to extensive Federal, state, provincial and municipal environmental statutes, regulations and policies, including those promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, Environment Canada, Alberta Environment, the Department of Health Services, and the Air Quality Management District, that govern activities and operations that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges into air and water, as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes. Some of these statutes and regulations impose strict liability for the costs of cleaning up, and for damages resulting from, sites of spills, disposals, or other releases of contaminants, hazardous substances and other materials and for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at properties leased or operated by us and at off-site locations where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. In addition, we may be subject to claims and lawsuits brought by private parties seeking damages and other remedies with respect to similar matters. We have not to date needed to make material expenditures to comply with current environmental statutes, regulations and policies. However, we cannot predict the impact and costs those possible future statutes, regulations and policies will have on our business.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 38 full time employees in the United States. Of these, five were engaged in research and development which includes clinical, regulatory, and quality. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
Corporate Information
    We were formed as a Nevada corporation in 2004. Our corporate headquarters address 11495 Valleyview Road, Eden Prairie, MN 55344, and our main telephone number is (770) 419-7525.

We make available on our website, free of charge, our periodic reports and registration statements filed with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements
 
On March 28, 2023, the Audit Committee (the “Audit Committee”) of the Board of Directors of the Company, after consulting with management and the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Marcum LLP, determined that the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in its 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2022 and the Company’s previously issued condensed interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the interim periods in 2022 as filed in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022 should no longer be relied upon due to material misstatements that are described in greater detail in Note 3 and Note 22.
 
Any previously filed reports, press releases, earnings releases, or investor presentations or other communications describing the Company’s financial statements and other related financial information covering the previously mentioned periods should no longer be relied upon.

   SANUWAVE HEALTH, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 December 31, 2022 and 2021
 
 1.          Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
   
 SANUWAVE Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries (“SANUWAVE” or the “Company”) is focused on the commercialization of its patented noninvasive and biological response activating medical systems for the repair and regeneration of skin, musculoskeletal tissue, and vascular structures.

 
 Basis of Presentation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.   
 The functional currencies of the Company’s foreign operations are their local currencies. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiary have been translated into United States dollars. All balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income statement amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the year. Translation adjustments are reported in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss and as cumulative translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.   
 Segment information - We have determined that we have one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily generated from sales in the United States. All significant expenses are generated, and all significant assets are located in the United States.    
 Reclassification - Certain accounts in the prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current year consolidated financial statements. These reclassifications had no effect on the previously reported operating results.  
    2.          Going Concern
   
       Our recurring losses from operations and dependency upon future issuances of equity or other financing to fund ongoing operations have raised substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and remain a going concern; we may not be able to do so, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us.    
  The continuation of our business is dependent upon raising additional capital. We expect to devote substantial resources for the expansion and continued commercialization of our UltraMIST and PACE systems which will require additional capital resources. The operating losses and the events of default on the Company’s notes payable indicate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.       Management’s plans are to obtain additional capital in 2023 through the conversion of outstanding warrants, issuance of common or preferred stock, securities convertible into common stock, or secured or unsecured debt. These possibilities, to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. Although no assurances can be given, management believes that potential additional issuances of equity or other potential financing transactions if obtained as discussed above should provide the necessary funding for us. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds through financing transactions with unfavorable terms.    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

    3.          Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
     During the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company determined that it had not appropriately accounted for certain transactions under US GAAP.  These transactions included shares issued for services, which caused general and administrative expense to be understated, and the sale of assets under a financing agreement, which a gain on sale was recognized and overstated.  Also, during the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K it was discovered that certain vendor invoices were not properly recorded, causing general and administrative expense to be understated in prior periods, interest calculation on senior debt, which caused interest expense to be understated, and an inventory adjustment was posted improperly, which caused cost of revenues to be understated. 
    In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 99, Materiality, and SAB 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, the Company evaluated the materiality of the errors from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, individually and in aggregate, and concluded that the errors were material to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarters ending March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022, and September 30, 2022. Management restated the impacted financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2022, the quarter and six-months ending June 30, 2022, and the quarter and nine-months ending September 30, 2022. Refer to Note 22 for restated quarterly financial statements.
    4.          Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
   
 The significant accounting policies followed by the Company are summarized below:   
 Estimates – These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because a precise determination of assets and liabilities, and correspondingly revenues and expenses, depend on future events, the preparation of consolidated financial statements for any period necessarily involves the use of estimates and assumptions. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. These consolidated financial statements have, in management’s opinion, been properly prepared within reasonable limits of materiality and within the framework of the accounting policies summarized herein.   
 Significant estimates include the recording of allowances for doubtful accounts, the net realizable value of inventory, fair value of goodwill and intangible assets, the determination of the valuation allowances for deferred taxes, estimated fair value of stock-based compensation, and the estimated fair value of embedded derivatives, including warrants and embedded conversion options.   
 Accounts receivable — Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings based on its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Receivables are generally considered past due if greater than 60 days old. Balances that are still outstanding after management has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Management routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, consequently, believes accounts receivable are stated at the net realizable value and credit risk exposure is limited.   
 Inventory - Inventory consists of purchased medical equipment and parts and is stated at the lower of average cost, which is valued using the first in, first out (“FIFO”) method, or net realizable value less allowance for selling and distribution expenses. The Company analyzes its inventory levels and writes down inventory that has, or is expected to, become obsolete.   
 Goodwill — Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. The Company completes its goodwill impairment test annually in the fourth quarter. The Company performed a qualitative evaluation at the reporting unit level and determined there was no goodwill impairment as of December 31, 2022, and 2021.    
 Intangible Assets — Intangible assets arising from the Company’s acquisition are amortized on a straight‑line basis over the estimated useful life of each asset. Customer relationships have a useful life of seven years. Patents and tradenames have a useful life of nineteen years.   
 Impairment of long-lived assets – The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the asset’s carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company determines fair value by using a combination of comparable market values and discounted cash flows, as appropriate.   
 Leases – The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. When lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance) separately based on their relative standalone prices.   
 F-7
 

 For leases where the Company is the lessee, Right of Use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases did not provide an implicit interest rate, the Company used the equivalent borrowing rate for a secured financing with the term of equal to the remaining life of the lease at inception.   
 Any lease arrangements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, and the Company recognizes lease costs for these lease arrangements on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the event a lease arrangement would provide us with options to exercise one or more renewal terms or to terminate the lease arrangement, we would include these options when we are reasonably certain to exercise them in the lease term used to establish ROU assets and lease liabilities. None of our lease agreements include an option to purchase the leased asset, residual value guarantees, or material restrictive covenants.   
 The Company has other lease arrangements that are adjusted periodically based on an inflation index or rate. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown, and therefore they are not included as minimum lease payments used to determine ROU assets and lease liabilities. Variable rental payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred.
 
 Fair value of financial instruments - The carrying values of accounts payable, and other short-term obligations approximate their fair values, because of the short-term maturities of these instruments.   
 The Company utilizes the guidance of ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements (“ASC 820-10”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. The framework that is set forth in this standard is applicable to the fair value measurements where it is permitted or required under other accounting pronouncements.   
 The ASC 820-10 hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs, or assumptions, used in the determination of fair value and requires financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:   
 
Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   
 Sequencing policy – The Company follows a sequencing policy for which in the event partial reclassifications of contracts subject to ASC Topic 815-40-25, Derivatives and Hedging, is necessary, due to the Company’s inability to demonstrate it has sufficient authorized shares, shares will be allocated based on earliest issuance date of potentially dilutive instruments with the earliest grants receiving first allocation of shares. 

  
 Convertible promissory notes – The Company evaluates its convertible instruments to determine if those contracts, or embedded components of those contracts, qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 815 “Derivatives and Hedging” (“ASC 815”). The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record embedded conversion options and any related freestanding instruments at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. Conversion options are recorded as a discount to the host instrument and are amortized as amortization of debt discount on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss over the life of the underlying instrument. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes because of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification.

 
 Debt discount – The Company records a debt discount related to warrants issued with debt at fair value and recognizes the cost using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the related debt as interest expense, which is reported in the Other Income (Expense) section in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. This debt discount is reported as a reduction of the related debt liability.   
 Contract Liabilities – Device product sales are bundled with an initial one-year warranty and the Company offers a separately priced multi-year warranty. Because the warranty represents an obligation, revenue is deferred as a contract liability and recognized over the time that the Company satisfies its performance obligations, which is generally the warranty term.
 
 Revenue Recognition - The core principle of ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”) requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company allocates the transaction price to all contractual performance obligations included in the contract. If a contract has more than one performance obligation, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on standalone selling price, which depicts the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue primarily from the following types of contracts:    
       
 F-8
 

  
 System Sales, Accessory and Part Sales - System sales, accessory and part sales include devices and applicators (new and refurbished). Performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is generally at the point in time that the product is shipped.
   
      
 Licensing Fees - Licensing transactions include distribution licenses and intellectual property licenses. Licensing revenue is recognized as the Company satisfies its performance obligations, which may vary with the terms of the licensing agreement.
   
      
 Other Revenue - Other revenue primarily includes warranties, repairs, and billed freight. The Company allocates the device sales price to the product and the embedded warranty by reference to the stand-alone extended warranty price. Warranty revenue is recognized over the time that the Company satisfies its performance obligations, which is generally the warranty term. Repairs (parts and labor) and billed freight revenue are recognized at the point in time that the service is performed, or the product is shipped, respectively.
         
 Shipping and handling costs - Shipping charges billed to customers are included in revenues. Shipping and handling costs incurred have been recorded in cost of goods sold totaled $324 thousand and $377 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.   
 Research and development - Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs include costs of research, engineering, and technical activities to develop a new product, researching an expanded product use or making significant improvements to existing products, including the costs of clinical development.

 
    Stock-based compensation - The Company uses the fair value method of accounting for its employee stock option program. Stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards is based on the estimated fair value of the award measured on the grant date. The Company recognizes the estimated fair value of the award as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term. The Company generally issues new shares of common stock to satisfy option and warrant exercises.
    
 
  The expected life of options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and are derived from the contractual terms of the options granted calculated under the simplified method. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The expected volatility is based on the average volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected dividend yield is based on our historical dividend experience, however, since our inception, we have not declared dividends.  Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.   
 
 Comprehensive income (loss) – Comprehensive income (loss) results from the translation of the Company’s foreign entity’s financial statements from their functional currency to U.S. dollars for consolidation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.   
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements –    
 
 
 In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which was subsequently revised by ASU 2018-19. The ASU introduces a new model for assessing impairment of most financial assets. Entities will be required to use a forward-looking expected loss model, which will replace the current incurred loss model, resulting in earlier recognition of allowance for losses. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after January 2023 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its consolidated financial statements.

    5.          Loss per share
   
 The net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. In accordance with ASC Topic 260-10-45-13, Earnings Per Share, the weighted average of number of shares outstanding includes outstanding common stock and shares issuable for nominal consideration. Accordingly, warrants issued with a $0.01 per share exercise price, are included in weighted average shares outstanding as follows:
   
 
(in thousands) | December 31, 2022 | | December 31, 2021
----------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------+---------+------------------
Common shares | | 526,530 | | 481,620
Common shares issuable assuming exercise of nominally priced warrants | | 22,941 | | 36,736 
Weighted Average Shares Outstanding | | 549,471 | | 518,356

   
 Diluted net loss per share would be computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. To the extent that securities are “anti-dilutive,” they are excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share. As a result of the net loss for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, all potentially dilutive shares were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share. Anti-dilutive equity securities consist of the following:

   9.          Factoring Liabilities
     In June 2021, the Company entered into a factoring agreement with an unrelated third party, pursuant to which the Company may sell certain of its accounts receivables for 86.25% of the value of the receivable. Advances available under the facility are capped at the lesser of $3.0 million or a formula amount, as defined in the agreement. Interest on advances is assessed at a fixed amount upon funding, which is equivalent to an annualized rate of 15.0% for the first 30 days, and daily thereafter at an annualized rate of 14.4%. The agreement’s term is one month and automatically renews for additional one-month periods, unless either party provides 30 days’ notice of termination. The accounts receivable is sold with recourse back to the Company, therefore, the Company accounts for the arrangement as traditional financing.

  Senior secured promissory note payable, in default (“Senior Secured Note”) – In August 2020, the Company entered into a Note and Warrant Purchase and Security Agreement (the “NWPSA”). In accordance with the NWPSA, the Company issued a $15 million Senior Secured Promissory Note Payable (the “Senior Secured Note”) and a warrant exercisable into shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for cash to support operations, repay outstanding debt and close on the acquisition of the UltraMIST assets from Celularity Inc. (Celularity) among other transactions.
        
 In February 2022, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Note and Warrant Purchase and Security Agreement (the “Second NWPSA”) for $3.0 million, for a total of $18.0 million outstanding. Along with the issuance of the note, the Company also issued warrants to purchase 16.2 million shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.18 and 20.6 million shares of common stock.  Since the combined fair value of the warrants and common stock issued as part of the Second NWPSA exceeded the face value of the note, the additional amount beyond the face value was recorded as a loss on issuance totaling $3.4 million.   
      
 Interest is charged at the greater of prime rate or 3% plus 9%, paid quarterly.  Principal increases at a rate of 3% of the outstanding principal balance (PIK interest) on each quarterly interest payment date.  Original maturity date of the Senior Secured Note is September 20, 2025, and it can be prepaid.     
  In June 2022, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the Note and Warrant Purchase and Security Agreement (the “Third NWPSA”). The Third NWPSA provides for (i) the extension of the agent’s and holder’s forbearance of exercising its remedies arising from Existing Defaults (as defined in the NWPSA) to the earlier of (x) the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the NWPSA) or (y) August 30, 2022, and (ii) the extension to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register the resale of the Advisor Shares (as defined in the NWPSA) no later than August 30, 2022.     
 F-11
 

  As of December 31, 2022, the Company is in default of the minimum liquidity provisions in the Senior Secured Note and, as a result, it is classified in current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company is accruing interest at the default interest rate of an incremental 5%.    
  The debt issuance costs, and debt discount related to the Senior Secured Note were capitalized as a reduction in the principal amount and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Senior Secured Note. The amortization of the debt issuance costs and debt discount, included in interest expense, for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, totaled $1.6 million and $910 thousand, respectively. Accrued interest related to the Senior Secured Note was $1.9 million and $1.6 million on December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Interest expense on the Senior Secured Note totaled $5.9 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

  2022 Convertible Notes Payable and 2022 Convertible Notes Payable, Related Parties - In August 2022 and November 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreements (the “Purchase Agreements”), for the sale in a private placement of (i) Future Advance Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) in an aggregate principal amount of $16.2 million in August and $4.0 million in November, (ii) Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase an additional 504.4 million shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.067 per share and (iii) Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase an additional 504.4 million shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.04 per share. The Company paid issuance costs totaling approximately $1.4 million.  Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, totaled $4.4 million, $1.2 million in contractual interest expense and $3.2 million in amortization of debt discount and issuance costs.
    
  
  
  
 
 Pursuant to the Notes, the Company promised to pay in cash and/or in shares of common stock, at a conversion price of $0.04 (the “Conversion Price”), the principal amount and interest at a rate of 15% per annum on any outstanding principal. The Conversion Price of the Notes is subject to adjustment, including if the Company issues or sells shares of common stock for a price per share less than the Conversion Price of the Notes or if the Company lists its shares of common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market and the average volume weighted average price of such common stock for the five trading days preceding such listing is less than $0.04 per share; provided, however, that the Conversion Price shall never by less than $0.01. The Notes contain customary events of default and covenants, including limitations on incurrences of indebtedness and liens.  In addition, pursuant to the Notes, the Company agreed to reduce its outstanding shares via a reverse stock split to provide the number of authorized and unissued shares of common stock sufficient to permit the conversion of these Notes on or before December 31, 2022. However, the Company obtained a waiver of this requirement through December 31, 2023 from all holders of the Notes and amended its Articles of Incorporation to increase its number of authorized shares of common stock from 800,000,000 to 2,500,000,000.    
       
  Acquisition Convertible promissory notes payable - In August 2020, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Celularity to acquire Celularity’s UltraMIST assets. A portion of the aggregate consideration of $24 million paid for the assets included the issuance of a promissory note to Celularity in the principal amount of $4 million (the “Seller Note”). The Seller Note matured on August 6, 2021, and was not repaid. The Company’s failure to pay the outstanding principal balance when due constituted an event of default under the terms of the Seller Note and, accordingly, it began accruing additional interest of 5.0% in addition to the 12.0% initial rate, as of the date of the default. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Seller Notes had outstanding accrued interest of $1.5 million and $761 thousand, respectively.
   
       F-12
 

 
  The Company evaluated embedded conversion features within the convertible promissory note and determined that the conversion feature does not require to be bifurcated. Upon adoption of ASC 2020-6 effective January 1, 2021, the convertible promissory note is accounted for as a single liability due to the elimination of the beneficial conversion feature accounting model.   
       
  Convertible promissory notes payable, related party - In August 2020, the Company issued a convertible promissory note payable in the amount of $1.4 million. The note matured on August 6, 2021, and was not repaid and is currently in default. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the note had outstanding accrued interest of $444 thousand and $241 thousand, respectively.
   
        
  2021 Convertible Promissory Notes Payable – Previously, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “2021 Purchase Agreement”) for the sale by the Company in a private placement (the “2021 Private Placement”) of (i) the Company’s future advance convertible promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.4 million, later amended to $4.2 million and (ii) a warrant to purchase up to an additional 16,666,667 shares of common stock of the Company. The warrants had an exercise price of $0.18 per share and a four-year term.  Advances totaled $1.9 million and warrants to purchase 9.3 million shares were outstanding prior to the settlement discussed below.
    
        
  In addition, the Company issued notes to five institutional investors totaling approximately $0.5 million, which were subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as the Purchase Agreement. Warrants to purchase 2.8 million shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.18 per share were issued and outstanding prior to the settlement discussed below.    
        
  Upon the closing of the Private Placement in August 2022, the 2021 Convertible Promissory Notes Payable were paid and settled in full using proceeds from the Private Placement. The settlement payment included cash totaling $3.9 million, which included accrued interest and penalties, and the issuance of Company shares of common stock totaling 19.4 million shares. The lenders surrendered the outstanding warrants to the Company. The Company recognized a $0.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt during the year ended December 31, 2022.     

   
 
12. | SBA Loans
----+----------

   
 
 
 In February 2021, the Company received proceeds from a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan in the amount of $1.0 million pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. The SBA Loan was evidenced by a promissory note that matured on February 20, 2026, and bears interest of 1% per annum. The SBA loan contained customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults and breaches of representations, warranties and covenants. All or a portion of SBA loan may be fully or partially forgiven by the SBA upon application by the Company not later than June 2022 in accordance with SBA regulations. The Company received approval of the loan forgiveness application and recognized a gain on the extinguishment totaling $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.  
  13.          Fair Value Measurements
   
      
 The Company uses various inputs to measure the outstanding warrants and certain embedded conversion features associated with convertible debt on a recurring basis to determine the fair value of the liabilities.  The following table classifies the Company’s liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy:

    19.          Stock-Based Compensation
   
 On November 1, 2010, the Company approved the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan of SANUWAVE Health, Inc. effective as of January 1, 2010 (the “Stock Incentive Plan”). The Stock Incentive Plan permits grants of awards to selected employees, directors, and advisors of the Company in the form of restricted stock or options to purchase shares of common stock. Options granted may include non-statutory options as well as qualified incentive stock options. The Stock Incentive Plan is administered by the board of directors of the Company. The Stock Incentive Plan gives broad powers to the board of directors of the Company to administer and interpret the form and conditions of each option. The stock options granted under the Stock Incentive Plan are generally non-statutory options which generally vest over a period of up to three years and have a ten-year term. The options are granted at an exercise price determined by the board of directors of the Company to be the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Stock Incentive Plan reserved a total of 35,000,000 shares of common stock for grant. On December 31, 2022, there were 3,240,615 shares of common stock available for grant under the Stock Incentive Plan.  
     20.          Income Taxes
 
 The Company files income tax returns in the United States Federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is subject to United States Federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for any years that have net operating losses open until the net operating losses are used.   
 The components of the net loss before income taxes are as follows:

 In accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (“ASC 740”), the Company accounts for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided for the deferred tax assets, including loss carryforwards, when it is more likely than not that some portion or all a deferred tax asset will not be realized.   
 The income tax provision (benefit) from continuing operations consists of the following:

 As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not have any undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. As a result, no additional income or withholding taxes have been provided for. The Company does not anticipate any impacts of the global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) and base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”) and as such, the Company has not recorded any impact associated with either GILTI or BEAT.   
 The income tax provision (benefit) amounts differ from the amounts computed by applying the United States Federal statutory income tax rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021. Adjustments to determine income tax expense are as follow:

  On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “Inflation Reduction Act”) into law. The Inflation Reduction Act imposes an excise tax of 1% on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. The impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods. We continue to analyze the impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax which is not currently applicable to the Company.   
 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development (“R&D”) expenditures under section 174 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. This rule became effective for the Company during 2022 and resulted in capitalized R&D costs of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company will amortize these costs for tax purposes over five years for R&D performed in the U.S. and over 15 years for R&D performed outside the U.S. In 2022, all R&D was performed in the U.S.   
 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers, whether it is “more likely than not”, that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible.    
 ASC 740 requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is “more likely than not” that all, or a portion of, deferred tax assets will not be realized. A review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered, including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. After consideration of all the information available, management believes that uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of its deferred tax assets and has, therefore, established a full valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022, and 2021.   
 The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards could be limited and subject to annual limitations. Since a full analysis under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code has not been performed, the Company may realize a “more than 50% change in ownership” which could limit its ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards accumulated to date to reduce future taxable income and tax liabilities. Additionally, because United States tax laws limit the time during which net operating loss carryforwards may be applied against future taxable income and tax liabilities, the Company may not be able to take advantage of all or portions of its net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes.   
 The Federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $159.7 million from years ending December 31, 2005, through December 31, 2017, will begin to expire in 2025. The Federal net operating loss carryforward for the years ended December 31, 2018, through 2022 of approximately $81.8 million will not expire. The state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $70.5 million from years ending December 31, 2005, through December 31, 2022, will expire at various dates through 2042. The foreign net operating loss carryforward on December 31, 2022, of $0.1 million will begin to expire in 2024.   
 F-19
 

 A provision of ASC 740 specifies that companies are to account for uncertainties in income tax reporting, and prescribes a methodology for recognizing, reversing, and measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return. ASC 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken while preparing the Company’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions would “more-likely-than-not” be sustained if challenged by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Management has evaluated and concluded that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022, and 2021. The Company does not expect any significant changes in the unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months of the reporting date.   
 The Company will recognize in income tax expense, interest and penalties related to income tax matters. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not have any amounts recorded for interest and penalties.  
    21.          Commitments and Contingencies
   
 Litigation   
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company from time to time becomes involved in various legal proceedings involving a variety of matters. The Company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. The Companies expenses legal fees in the period in which they are occurred.     Acquisition Dispute   
 The Company received notification alleging that it is not in compliance with the license agreement with Celularity entered in connection with the acquisition of the UltraMIST assets. The Company has responded and asserted that the Company is not in breach and that the supplier has breached various agreements. It is too early to determine the outcome of this matter. Any potential impact to the Company cannot be fully determined at this time and there is no guarantee that the dispute will be resolved in a manner beneficial to the Company or at all.    Lease Commitments   
 As of December 31, 2022, the maturities of the Company’s operating and financing leases, which have initial or remaining lease terms more than one year, consist of the following:
