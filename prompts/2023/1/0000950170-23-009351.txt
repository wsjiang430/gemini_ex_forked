Item 1. Business
GENERAL
In this Form 10-K, all references to the “Company,” “Movado Group,” "we," "us" or "our" include Movado Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NYSE under the trading symbol MOV.
Movado Group designs, sources, markets and distributes quality watches globally. Its portfolio of watch brands is currently comprised of owned brands MOVADO®, CONCORD®, EBEL®, OLIVIA BURTON® and MVMT® as well as licensed brands COACH®, TOMMY HILFIGER®, HUGO BOSS®, LACOSTE® and CALVIN KLEIN®. The Company is a leader in the design, development, marketing and distribution of watch brands sold in almost every major category comprising the watch industry. The Company also designs, sources, markets and distributes jewelry and other accessories under most of its brands.
 The Company was incorporated in New York in 1967 under the name North American Watch Corporation to acquire Piaget Watch Corporation and Corum Watch Corporation, which had been, respectively, the exclusive importers and distributors of Piaget and Corum watches in the United States since the 1950’s. Since then, strategic acquisitions of watch brands and their subsequent growth, along with license agreements, have played an important role in the expansion of the Company’s brand portfolio. Over time, the Company has developed its brand-building reputation and distinctive image across an expanding number of brands and geographic markets.
 In 1970, the Company acquired the Concord brand and the Swiss company that had been manufacturing Concord watches since 1908. In 1983, the Company acquired the U.S. distributor of Movado watches and substantially all of the assets related to the Movado brand from the Swiss manufacturer of Movado watches. The Company changed its name to Movado Group, Inc. in 1996. The Company sold its Piaget and Corum distribution businesses in 1999 and 2000, respectively, to focus on its own portfolio of brands. In March 2004, the Company completed its acquisition of Ebel, one of the world’s premier luxury watch brands which was established in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1911. In July 2017, the Company completed its acquisition of Olivia Burton, which was one of the United Kingdom’s fastest-growing fashion watch and jewelry brands since its founding in 2011. In October 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of MVMT, which was founded in 2013, offering watches and accessories designed for the millennial consumer largely through a direct-to-consumer business model.
 The Company is highly selective in its licensing strategy and chooses to enter into long-term agreements with only powerful brands which we deem to have strong positions in their respective businesses.

The following table sets forth the brands licensed by the Company and the year in which the Company launched each licensed brand for watches.

Exclusive Watches
Exclusive watches are usually made of precious metals, including 18 karat gold or platinum, and are often set with precious gems. These watches are primarily mechanical or quartz-analog watches. Mechanical watches keep time with intricate mechanical movements consisting of an arrangement of wheels, jewels and winding and regulating mechanisms. Quartz-analog watches have quartz movements in which time is precisely calibrated to the regular frequency of the vibration of quartz crystal. Exclusive watches are manufactured almost entirely in Switzerland. Well-known brand names of exclusive watches include Audemars Piguet, Rolex, Patek Philippe, Piaget and Vacheron Constantin. The Company does not compete in the exclusive watch category.
Luxury Watches
Luxury watches are either quartz-analog or mechanical watches. These watches typically are made with either stainless steel, ceramic, 14 or 18 karat gold, or a combination of gold and stainless steel, and are occasionally set with precious gems. Luxury watches are primarily manufactured in Switzerland. In addition to a majority of the Company’s Ebel and Concord watches, well-known brand names of luxury watches include Baume & Mercier, Breitling, Cartier, Omega and TAG Heuer.
Accessible Luxury Watches
The majority of accessible luxury watches are quartz-analog watches, occasionally including connected technology for transmitting data wirelessly between the watch and a smartphone or other device. These watches typically are made with stainless steel, ceramic, gold plating or a combination of gold plating and stainless steel. Accessible luxury watches are manufactured primarily in Switzerland, although some are manufactured in Asia. In addition to a majority of the Company’s Movado watches, well-known brand names of accessible luxury watches include Gucci, Rado, Michele and Raymond Weil.
Moderate and Fashion Watches
Most moderate and fashion watches are quartz-analog watches, some of which may also included connected technology for transmitting data wirelessly between the watch and a smartphone or other device. These watches typically are made with stainless steel, brass, plastic, gold plating, or a combination of gold plating and stainless steel. Moderate and fashion watches are manufactured primarily in Asia and Switzerland. In addition to the Company’s Calvin Klein, Coach, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Olivia Burton, MVMT and Tommy Hilfiger brands, well-known brand names of watches in the moderate and fashion category include Anne Klein, Bulova, Citizen, Fossil, Guess, Seiko, Michael Kors, Daniel Wellington and Swatch. Market leaders for smartwatches include Apple, Samsung and Garmin.
Mass Market Watches

Jewelry and Other Fashion Accessories
 
In addition to its core watch business, the Company also designs, sources, markets and distributes jewelry and, to a lesser extent, other fashion accessories such as sunglasses. The Company’s jewelry offerings consist mostly of fashion jewelry, although some fine jewelry pieces are also included in certain collections. We generally market our fashion accessories through the same distribution channels as our watches and use similar marketing approaches. Sales of jewelry accounted for 6.7% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2023.
 BRANDS
The Company designs, develops, sources, markets and distributes products under the following brands:
Owned Brands
 Concord
Concord was founded through the harmonious collaboration of five Swiss visionaries in 1908. In 1979, Concord spearheaded the Swiss quartz revolution with one of the most important watches of the twentieth century: the Concord Delirium. This was the first watch ever produced to be less than one millimeter thick – a world record to this day. To mark its 110th anniversary, Concord introduced a new logo depicting a knot. The knot signifies the brand’s foundation through harmonious unity and its laudable technical achievements and distinctive designs. The current Mariner SL watch captures this spirit and helps carry on Concord’s strong legacy.
 Ebel
Ebel’s success has been built upon the fusion of technical excellence and a passion for aesthetically daring and timeless, distinctive design. A passion for innovation and excellence in watch design has always been at the heart of the Ebel brand. Ebel was founded in 1911 by husband and wife Eugène Blum and Alice Lévy, in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland. Since its inception, Ebel has remained true to its core values, manufacturing fine Swiss watches that marry beauty and function. In 2017 Ebel successfully relaunched its most iconic collection, the Ebel Sports Classic, which is renowned for its iconic bracelet design with signature wave-shaped links that helped to establish the sport-chic category in the late 70’s. Ebel continues to create timepieces that embody luxury and contemporary elegance.
Movado
 The Movado brand is renowned for its iconic Museum® dial and modern design aesthetic. Since its founding in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland in 1881, Movado has earned more than 100 patents and 200 international awards for artistry and innovation in watch design and technology, and Movado timepieces have won world renown for their unique beauty and timeless design. The Movado jewelry collection reflects the same timeless modern design aesthetic as its watches.
 Movado is a hallmark of some of the most famous timepieces ever created, most notably, the Movado Museum® Watch. Designed in 1947 by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt, the watch dial defined by a solitary dot at 12 o’clock, symbolizing the sun at high noon, has been acclaimed for purity of design unrivaled in the history of time-keeping. When Horwitt’s dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, it became the first watch dial ever awarded this distinction. This legendary dial is regarded as an icon of Modernism. A trademarked and award-winning design, the celebrated single dot dial now distinguishes a wide range of Movado timepieces.

Along with its long, rich heritage of design innovation, the Movado brand experience is also defined by a close, enduring association with the arts. Expressions of Movado’s commitment to the fine and cultural arts encompass commissioned watch designs by famed artists, affiliations with talented brand ambassadors, sponsorship of major arts institutions and support of emerging artists.
MVMT

The MVMT brand was founded in a Southern California apartment in 2013 by two entrepreneurs. Originally empowered by crowdfunding and built digitally with a community of social media followers, their philosophy was to create a brand offering quality, sleek watches that are accessible to young consumers. MVMT’s designs and messaging embody the spirit of adventuring, creating, and daring to disrupt the norm. The brand’s design catalogue has since expanded into more than 20 unique watch collections, sunglasses, blue light eyewear and jewelry.
Olivia Burton
 Olivia Burton is a brand founded by two friends who started out as fashion buyers who recognized a gap in the market for unique and feminine women’s watch styles. Inspired by vintage, fashion trends and nature, the Olivia Burton design team blends contemporary and vintage styles to conceive new collections periodically. As well as innovative timepieces, including vegan, eco-friendly and unisex collections, Olivia Burton has a large and growing collection of jewelry styles that exhibit the same attention to detail seen in its watches.
Licensed Brands
 Below is a description of the Company’s licensed brands.
Coach Watches
Coach watches reflect the Coach brand image and classic American style. The Coach brand stands for authenticity, innovation, and relevance, as well as effortless New York style. It is an integral part of the American luxury landscape. With an expanding presence globally, the Coach brand exemplifies modern luxury. As an extension of the brand, Coach watches offer a fresh and compelling assortment of timepieces for women and men, with a wide variety of metal bracelets and genuine Coach leather straps.
Tommy Hilfiger Watches and Jewelry

 Hugo Boss Watches and Jewelry
Hugo Boss is one of the market leaders in the global apparel market. Hugo Boss focuses on developing and marketing premium fashion and accessories for men and women under the Hugo and the Boss brands. Licensed products such as watches, jewelry and other accessories complement the apparel collections. Boss watches and jewelry reflect the sophisticated character and craftsmanship for which all Boss products are known. Hugo watches accessorize the open-minded, fashion-forward consumer.
 Lacoste Watches and Jewelry
The Lacoste watch and jewelry collections embrace the Lacoste lifestyle proposition which encompasses French elegance and sporting spirit, as well as innovation for style and freedom of movement. Mirroring key attributes of the Lacoste brand, the collection features stylish timepieces and jewelry with a contemporary and urban flair inspired by sport, free movement and French elegance.
Calvin Klein Watches and Jewelry
 The Calvin Klein collection of watches and jewelry was created with the modern customer in mind. Featuring timeless, minimalist designs that highlight Calvin Klein's globally-recognized aesthetic, the collection of men's and women's accessories reflects the sensuality and boldness that has come to define the brand for over 50 years.
DESIGN AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
The Company’s offerings undergo two phases before they are produced for sale to customers: design and product development. The design phase includes the creation of artistic and conceptual renderings while product development involves the construction of prototypes. The Company’s licensed brand watches, Olivia Burton watches, MVMT watches and certain Movado brand watch styles are designed by in-house design teams in cooperation with outside sources, including (in the case of the licensed brands) licensors’ design teams. Watch product development for these brands takes place in the Company’s Asia operations. For the Company’s Ebel and Concord watch brands and various Movado brand watch styles, the watch design phase is performed by a combination of in-house and freelance designers in Europe and the United States while product development is carried out in the Company’s Swiss operations. The Company’s jewelry and other accessories are designed by in-house design teams in cooperation with outside sources and are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia and, to a lesser extent, the United States.
 MARKETING
The Company’s marketing strategy is to communicate a consistent, brand-specific message to the consumer. As the consumer footprint continues to evolve, the Company is increasingly focused on its digital marketing and online reach, including expanding and improving its social media channels and its messaging through individuals with significant social media followings (i.e., “influencers”), as well as elevating its customers’ digital experience globally through innovative technologies and consumer-facing initiatives. Recognizing that advertising is an integral component to the successful marketing of its product offerings, the Company devotes significant resources to advertising and maintains its own in-house advertising department which focuses primarily on the implementation and management of global marketing and advertising strategies for each of the Company’s brands, ensuring consistency of presentation. The Company develops advertising campaigns individually for each of the Company’s brands, utilizing outside agencies as deemed appropriate. These campaigns are directed primarily to the end consumer rather than to trade customers. The Company’s advertising takes into account the image and price range of each brand. Company advertising is placed in magazines and other print media, on radio and television, online, including websites and social media platforms, in catalogs, on outdoor signs and through other promotional materials. Marketing expenses totaled 16.8%, 16.3%, and 16.9% of net sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Company conducts its business primarily in two operating segments: Watch and Accessory Brands and Company Stores. For operating segment data and geographic segment data for the years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements regarding Segment and Geographic Information.
 The Company’s Watch and Accessory Brands segment includes the designing, manufacturing and distribution of watches and, to a lesser extent, jewelry and other accessories, of quality owned and licensed brands, in addition to revenue generated from after-sales service activities and shipping. The Company Stores segment includes the Company’s retail outlet business.


The Company divides its business into two major geographic locations: United States operations, and International, which includes the results of all non-U.S. Company operations. The vast majority of the Company’s tangible International assets are owned by the Company’s Swiss and Hong Kong subsidiaries. For a discussion of the risks associated with the Company’s operations conducted outside the United States, see “A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted outside of the United States. Many factors affecting business activities outside the United States could adversely impact this business” under Item 1A. Risk Factors, below.
 Watch and Accessory Brands
Watch and Accessory Brands Business in the United States
 The Company sells all of its brands in the U.S. Watch and Accessory Brands market primarily to department stores, such as Macy’s and Nordstrom; major jewelry store chains, such as Signet Jewelers, Ltd. and Helzberg Diamonds Corp.; independent jewelers; and third-party e-commerce retailers, such as Amazon; as well as directly to consumers through the Company’s owned e-commerce websites, such as www.movado.com and www.mvmt.com. Sales to trade customers in the United States are made directly by the Company’s U.S. sales force and, to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives. Sales representatives are responsible for a defined geographic territory, generally specialize in a particular brand and sell to and service independent jewelers within their territory. The sales force also consists of account executives and account representatives who, respectively, sell to and service chain and department store accounts.
Watch and Accessory Brands Business in International Markets
 Internationally, the Company’s brands are sold to department stores, jewelry chains, independent jewelers and third-party e-commerce retailers, as well as directly to consumers through the Company’s owned e-commerce websites, such as www.oliviaburton.com. The Company employs its own international sales force operating at the Company’s sales and distribution offices in Australia, Canada, Mainland China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. In addition, the Company sells all of its brands through a network of independent distributors operating in numerous countries around the world. A majority of the Company’s arrangements with its international distributors are long-term, generally require certain minimum purchases and minimum advertising expenditures and impose restrictions on the distributor’s sale of competitive products.
Company Stores
 The Company’s subsidiary, Movado Retail Group, Inc., operates 51 retail outlet locations in outlet centers across the United States and four retail outlet locations in outlet centers in Canada, as well as an online outlet store at www.movadocompanystore.com. These stores serve as effective channels to sell current and discontinued models and factory seconds of all of the Company’s watches.
SEASONALITY
The Company’s sales are traditionally greater during the Christmas and holiday season. Consequently, the Company’s net sales historically have been higher during the second half of its fiscal year. The amount of net sales and operating profit generated during the second half of each fiscal year depends upon the general level of retail sales during the Christmas and holiday season, as well as economic conditions and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring. The second half of each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 accounted for 54.0%, 57.9% and 68.8% of the Company’s net sales, respectively. The first half of fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
BACKLOG
At March 20, 2023, the Company had unfilled orders of $40.7 million compared to $60.9 million at March 21, 2022 and $46.0 million at March 22, 2021. Unfilled orders include both confirmed orders and orders that the Company believes will be confirmed based on the historical experience with the customers. It is customary for many of the Company’s customers not to confirm their future orders with formal purchase orders until shortly before their desired delivery dates.
CUSTOMER SERVICE, WARRANTY AND REPAIR
The Company assists in the retail sales process of its wholesale customers by monitoring their sales and inventories by product category and style. The Company also assists in the conception, development and implementation of customers’ marketing vehicles. The Company places considerable emphasis on cooperative advertising programs with its wholesale customers. The Company’s assistance in the retail sales process has resulted in close relationships with its principal customers, often allowing for influence on the mix and quantity. The Company believes that customers’ familiarity with its sales approach has facilitated, and should continue to facilitate, the introduction of new products through its distribution network.
The Company permits the return of damaged or defective products. In addition, although the Company generally has no obligation to do so, it accepts other returns from customers in certain instances.
The Company has service facilities around the world, including four Company-owned service facilities and a number of independent service centers which are authorized to perform warranty repairs. A list of authorized service centers can be accessed online at www.mgiservice.com. In order to maintain consistency and quality at its service facilities and authorized independent service centers, the Company conducts training sessions and distributes technical information and updates to repair personnel. All watches sold by the Company come with limited warranties covering the movement against defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from two to three years from the date of purchase. Products that are returned under warranty to the Company are generally serviced by the Company’s employees at its service facilities.
The Company retains adequate levels of component parts to facilitate both the manufacturing of its watches as well as the after-sales service of its watches for an extended period of time after the discontinuance of the manufacturing of such watches.
The Company makes available a web-based system at www.mgiservice.com providing immediate access for the Company’s retail partners to information they may want or need about after sales service issues. The website allows the Company’s retailers to track their repair status online 24 hours a day. The system also permits customers to authorize repairs, track repair status through the entire repair life cycle, view repair information and obtain service order history.
SOURCING, PRODUCTION AND QUALITY
The Company does not manufacture any of the products it sells. The Company employs a flexible manufacturing model that relies on independent manufacturers to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. All product sources must achieve and maintain the Company’s high-quality standards and specifications. With strong supply chain organizations predominantly in Switzerland, Mainland China and Hong Kong, the Company maintains control over the quality of its products, wherever they are manufactured. Compliance is monitored with strictly enforced quality control standards, including on-site quality inspections.
The Swiss watch movements used in the manufacture of Movado, Ebel and Concord watches are purchased from three suppliers, with all mechanical movements coming from a single supplier. The Company obtains other watch components for all of its brands, including, cases, hands, dials, bracelets, straps and non-Swiss movements from a number of other suppliers. The Company generally does not have long-term supply commitments with any of its component parts suppliers.
Movado (with the exception of certain Movado collections), Ebel and Concord watches, as well as certain Calvin Klein watch styles, are manufactured in Switzerland by independent third-party assemblers using Swiss movements and other parts sourced by the Company’s Swiss operations. All of the Company’s products are manufactured using components obtained from third party suppliers. Certain Movado collections of watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia using Swiss movements. Coach, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Olivia Burton, MVMT, Tommy Hilfiger and most Calvin Klein watches are manufactured by independent contractors in Asia.
TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS
The Company owns the trademarks CONCORD®, EBEL®, MOVADO®, MVMT® and OLIVIA BURTON®, as well as trademarks for the Movado Museum® dial design, and related trademarks for watches and jewelry in the United States and in numerous other countries.
The Company licenses the trademark COACH® and related trademarks on an exclusive worldwide basis for use in connection with the manufacture, distribution, advertising and sale of watches pursuant to an amended license agreement with Tapestry, Inc. which is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2025.

Under an amended and restated license agreement with Tommy Hilfiger Licensing LLC entered into on March 20, 2020 and effective as of January 1, 2020 (the “Tommy Hilfiger License Agreement”), the Company has the exclusive license to use the trademark TOMMY HILFIGER® and related trademarks in connection with the manufacture, marketing, advertising, sale and distribution of watches and jewelry worldwide (excluding sales to certain accounts in Japan). The Tommy Hilfiger License Agreement expires December 31, 2024 and may be extended by the Company for an additional five years ending on December 31, 2029, subject to the satisfaction of minimum sales requirements and approval of a new business plan in the licensor’s reasonable discretion.
On March 17, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Hugo Boss Trade Mark Management GmbH & Co. that extended the term and made certain other changes to the license agreement originally entered into by the parties on December 15, 2004, as previously amended, under which the Company received a worldwide exclusive license to use the trademark HUGO BOSS® and any other trademarks containing the names “HUGO” or “BOSS”, in connection with the production, promotion and sale of watches. The current license agreement expands the arrangement to include BOSS-branded jewelry and continues the relationship through December 31, 2026, subject to certain rights of the Company to extend for an additional five years upon satisfaction of specified conditions.
On August 30, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated license agreement with Lacoste S.A., Sporloisirs S.A. and Lacoste Alligator S.A. (the “Lacoste License Agreement”), extending the term and making certain other changes to the license agreement originally entered into by the parties in 2006 as previously extended in 2014, under which the Company received a worldwide exclusive license to use the LACOSTE® name and the distinctive “crocodile” logo to design, produce, market and distribute watches. The amended Lacoste License Agreement, which has an effective date of January 1, 2022, continues through December 31, 2031 and authorizes the Company to produce and sell jewelry in addition to watches.
Effective August 19, 2020, the Company and Calvin Klein, Inc. (“CKI”) entered into a trademark license agreement under which CKI granted the Company a worldwide license to use the trademarks CALVIN KLEIN and CK/CALVIN KLEIN in connection with the development, manufacture, distribution, advertising, promotion and sale of watches and jewelry commencing January 1, 2022. The license is exclusive, subject to limited exceptions. The term of the Agreement continues until December 31, 2026 and may be renewed by the Company for an additional five years, subject to certain conditions, including the achievement of specified minimum sales.
The Company also owns a number of design patents and other design rights in the United States and internationally for various watch designs, as well as designs of watch dials, cases, bracelets and jewelry.
The Company actively seeks to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights by working with industry associations, anti-counterfeiting organizations, private investigators and law enforcement authorities, including customs authorities in the United States and internationally, and, when necessary, suing infringers of its trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights. Consequently, the Company is involved from time to time in litigation or other proceedings to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of these rights. The Company has registered the trademarks CONCORD®, EBEL®, MOVADO®, MVMT®, OLIVIA BURTON® and certain other related trademarks with customs authorities in the United States and certain other countries in order to assist such authorities in their efforts to prevent the importation of counterfeit goods or goods bearing confusingly similar trademarks. Customs regulations generally do not, however, protect against the unauthorized importation of genuine products.
COMPETITION
The markets for each of the Company’s watch and jewelry brands are highly competitive. With the exception of Swatch Group, Ltd., a large Swiss-based competitor, no single company directly competes with the Company across all of its brands. Multiple companies, however, compete with Movado Group with respect to one or more of its brands. Certain of these companies have, and other companies that may enter the Company’s markets in the future may have, greater financial, distribution, marketing and advertising resources than the Company. The Company’s future success will depend, to a significant degree, upon its continued ability to compete effectively with regard to, among other things, the style, quality, price, advertising, marketing, distribution and availability of supply of the Company’s watches and other products.
HUMAN CAPITAL

The Company believes that trust, respect, passion, and teamwork are critical to achieving its goals and therefore promotes a culture built around these values.

Programs and support vary by year, need and available resources.
REGULATION
