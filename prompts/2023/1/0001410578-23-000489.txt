Item 1.Business.
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to “DTOC” or the “Company” and to “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Digital Transformation Opportunities Corp.
Company Overview
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on November 17, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). Our sponsor is Digital Transformation Sponsor LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Sponsor”).
The registration statement for our initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) was declared effective on March 9, 2021. On March 12, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 33,350,000 units (“Units” and, with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”), at $10.00 per Unit, which includes 3,350,000 Units as a result of the underwriter’s partial exercise of its option to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional Units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, generating gross proceeds of $333.5 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $18.9 million, inclusive of $11.7 million in deferred underwriting commissions.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 6,113,333 warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant (“Private Placement Warrants”) to the Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of approximately $9.2 million.
Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement on March 12, 2021, $333.5 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement were placed in a trust account (“Trust Account”) located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and invested only in U.S. “government securities,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below.
On March 2, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the “Special Meeting”). The purpose of the Special Meeting was to approve the following proposals: (1) to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and Investment Management Trust Agreement, to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination (the “Combination Period”) from March 12, 2023 to June 30, 2023 (the “Extension Amendment Proposal” and “Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal”, respectively), conditioned on the deposit of $150,000 by the Sponsor into the Trust Account (the “Initial Contribution”) and to give the Sponsor the option to further extend the Combination Period beyond June 30, 2023 up to three (3) times for an additional one (1) month each time to September 30, 2023 (the “Extended Date”) upon the deposit into the Trust Account of $50,000 for each calendar month (each, an “Extension Option”), (2) to amend the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the limitation that the Company may not redeem Public Shares to the extent that such redemption would result in DTOC having net tangible assets (as determined in accordance with Rule 3a51-1(g)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) of less than $5,000,001 (the “Redemption Limitation”) in order to allow the Company to redeem Public Shares irrespective of whether such redemption would exceed the Redemption Limitation (the “Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal”), and (3) to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies if, based upon the tabulated vote at the time of the Special Meeting, there are not sufficient votes to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal, Trust Amendment Agreement Proposal, and the Redemption Limitation Amendment Proposal (collectively, the “Extension Proposals”). On March 2, 2023, the Company’s Sponsor contributed to the Trust Account $150,000 to fund the Extension Proposals. In connection with the approval of the Trust Agreement Amendment Proposal and Extension Amendment Proposal, the Sponsor and Chief Financial Officer converted all of their respective Founder Shares (as described in Note 5) into an aggregate of 8,262,500 shares of DTOC Class A common stock. Following conversion, such shares will vote together with the Public Shares on the AON Business Combination (as defined below); however, as such shares were not issued as part of the IPO, such shares are not entitled to any funds held in the Trust Account, including any interest thereon. 

1



In connection with the extension, stockholders holding 31,502,931 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the Trust Account. As a result, $321,160,140 (approximately $10.19 per share), was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders. Following these redemptions, the Company had 1,847,069 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and the aggregate amount remaining in the Trust Account at the time was $18,830,151.
On October 5, 2022, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (the “Business Combination Agreement”), with American Oncology Network, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“AON”) pursuant to which the combined company will be organized in an umbrella partnership C corporation structure, in which substantially all of the assets and the business of the combined company will be held by AON (the “AON Business Combination”). Upon the consummation of the AON Business Combination, the members of AON will include DTOC and the current unitholders of AON, and DTOC will be renamed American Oncology Network, Inc. (the “New AON”).
On January 6, 2023, we amended and restated the Business Combination Agreement (as amended, the “Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement”) to provide, among other things, that the board of managers of AON following the AON Business Combination will consist of (a) two managers designated by holders representing more than 50% of the AON common units and (b) three managers designated by New AON. In addition, the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement provides that AON unitholders may elect to receive, in lieu of any number of shares of New AON Class B common stock to which an AON unitholder would otherwise be entitled to receive, warrants to acquire such number of shares of New AON Class B common stock, by submitting an election in accordance with the procedures set forth in Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement. In connection with entering into the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement, DTOC and AON also revised the form of Amended and Restated Company LLC Agreement included as an exhibit to the Business Combination Agreement. The revised form of Amended and Restated Company LLC Agreement includes, among other revisions, certain additions and modifications in order to reflect the changes in the AON board of managers following the completion of the AON Business Combination (as described above).
In connection with the AON Business Combination, we may raise additional capital of up to $100 million in the form of convertible preferred securities (the “PIPE Investment”). Furthermore, the Business Combination Agreement provides that the obligation of AON to consummate the AON Business Combination is subject to the sum of the following amounts (collectively, the “Available Closing Acquiror Cash”) equaling or exceeding $60 million as of the Closing (the “Minimum Cash Condition”): (i) the aggregate cash proceeds available from the Trust Account (after giving effect to all redemptions of shares of DTOC Class A common stock), plus (ii) the cash funded to DTOC, AON or any subsidiary of AON during the period between signing of the Business Combination Agreement and Closing, or that will be funded to DTOC concurrently with the Closing, in each case pursuant to any equity or debt financing agreement or arrangement other than borrowings under the AON PNC Loans, plus (iii) the aggregate amount of capital offered in the PIPE Investment, but that is unreasonably rejected by AON (as further described in the Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement).
The Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement is further described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us on January 6, 2023. 
If we have not completed a business combination by June 30, 2023 (or by September 30, 2023 if all the Extension Options are exercised), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.

We believe that our broad network of relationships, including investors in private and public equity as well as seasoned operators, uniquely positions us to capitalize on the technology revolution that is changing the healthcare system. Our broad team has been constructed with a diverse set of skills and knowledge that we believe will drive to a successful business combination with a leading healthcare technology company. Our broad team has the following attributes, which we believe are a distinct competitive advantage in our ability to source and consummate a transaction:

● | Deep healthcare industry relationships across the entire spectrum of stakeholders, including with payors, provider groups, investment firms, leading companies, and industry thought leaders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Differentiated approach to driving long-term value creation, honed through years of operating and investment experience in high growth sectors of healthcare such as value-based healthcare and consumer-driven healthcare.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Robust pipeline of potential targets that meet our acquisition criteria through our broad network of relationships and meticulous approach to defining and refining our target opportunity set.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Experience positioning private companies for public markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Connectivity to key decision makers in the healthcare technology executive and investor community through our collective network.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to drive value creation post-transaction through a strategic playbook that embraces the role of technology to improve the healthcare system.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With respect to the above, past experience or performance of our management team and their respective affiliates is not a guarantee of either (i) our ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction or (ii) success with respect to any business combination that we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team or their respective affiliates as indicative of future performance. Our management team and their respective affiliates have been involved with a large number of public and private companies in addition to those identified above, not all of which have achieved similar performance levels. See “Risk Factors—Past performance by our management team or their respective affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.” No member of our management team has any experience in operating special purpose acquisition vehicles.
Business Strategy
Our strategy is to merge with a high growth company that has leveraged technology to make a significant improvement to the healthcare industry and has achieved or is expected to achieve leadership in its target market. We believe that there are numerous target opportunities available to DTOC which exhibit attractive growth characteristics, are meaningful in scale, and are driving digital transformation of various sectors of the healthcare industry. These target opportunities include companies supporting or enabling healthcare providers, healthcare facilities, practice management, billings & collections, health insurance, managed care, drug development, pharmaceuticals including digital therapeutics, healthcare financing solutions, and pharmacies.
We have a thematic and proactive investment strategy to identify and merge with a target company. We will leverage our deep healthcare and technology sector expertise to identify the companies that we think are best positioned in their respective sectors to capture leading market share and long-term growth. We will leverage our relationships with company founders and venture capital and growth equity investment firms to continue to source and build a pipeline of such well-positioned companies. We have cultivated a high priority list of potential targets that fit our investment criteria that we plan to pursue following our offering. We also plan to draw on the broad network and experience of our advisors to support our sourcing, diligence and transaction execution process. We will select a company that fits our acquisition criteria and that we expect to have sustainable long-term equity value appreciation as a public company.
We are particularly focused on targets that are benefiting from long-term, secular tailwinds in healthcare, including the migration to consumer-driven healthcare and value-based healthcare.
Acquisition Criteria
Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines:

● | Technology-first Business Model—the target business has a strong technology foundation that will enable continued scaling as technology is leveraged to serve customers in a manner that is superior to the status quo.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Compelling Customer Value Proposition—the target business has a customer-centric focus reflected in a strong NPS and customer loyalty, which creates a sustainable competitive advantage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Competitive Position—the target business uses scale, brand, and technology to differentiate its offering vis-à-vis competitors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Favorable Industry Tailwinds—the target business is supported by long-term consumer- and industry-specific tailwinds and focused on sectors with resilient or growing demand characteristics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Attractive and Repeatable Unit Economics—the target business has unit economics that are attractive and can be scaled without a material decline in return on growth investments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Entrepreneurial Management Team—the management team of the target business is entrepreneurial, data-driven, and committed to the long-term growth of the business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our management may deem relevant.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq listing rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the Trust Account (excluding any deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. We refer to this as the 80% of fair market value test. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). Even though our board of directors will rely on generally accepted standards, our board of directors will have discretion to select the standards employed. In addition, the application of the standards generally involves a substantial degree of judgment. Accordingly, investors will be relying on the business judgment of the board of directors in evaluating the fair market value of the target or targets. The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of our satisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of the 80% of fair market value test. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of fair market value test. If our initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.
Other Considerations
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination or, subject to certain exceptions, subsequent material transactions with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, to the extent required by applicable law or based upon the direction of our board of directors or a committee thereof, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), or from another entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Members of our management team directly or indirectly own our securities, and accordingly, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Our officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs, and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Certain of our directors presently have, and any of our officers and directors in the future may have, additional fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties to one or more other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entities. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer of our company unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us without violating another legal obligation. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for one or more entities to which he or she has fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties, he or she will honor these obligations and duties to present such business combination opportunity to such entities first, and only present it to us if such entities reject the opportunity and he or she determines to present the opportunity to us.
While our Sponsor and its affiliates will not have any duty to offer acquisition opportunities to us, our Sponsor and its affiliates may become aware of a potential transaction that is an attractive opportunity for us, which it may decide to share with us. Conflicts may arise from our Sponsor’s sponsorship of our company, as well as from actions undertaken by our Sponsor or any of its affiliates for their own account. When acting for their own account, our Sponsor or any of its affiliates’ other activities may, individually or in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on us, and the interests of our Sponsor or any of its affiliates may at times be adverse to ours.
We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary, contractual or other obligations or duties of our officers or directors or our Sponsor and its affiliates, will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
Corporate Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.

7



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the aggregate worldwide market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to emerging growth company will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the aggregate worldwide market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30th, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the aggregate worldwide market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates equaled or exceeded $700 million as of the prior June 30th. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements and other disclosures with other public companies difficult or impossible.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation may give others with greater resources an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
Our executive offices are located at 10250 Constellation Blvd, Suite 23126, Los Angeles, CA 90067 and our telephone number is (360) 949-1111. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Website
We maintain an Internet website at www.dtocorp.com. The information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website does not constitute a part of this report.
Employees
We currently have two executive officers, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
