As part of the merger, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation, the surviving entity, changed its name to Powerdyne International, Inc. prior to the merger, Greenmark did not have any ongoing business or operations and was established for the purpose of completing mergers and acquisitions with a target company, such as Powerdyne Nevada.

The Market
 
We service the Global Semiconductor Equipment Manufacture’s our Sales to International customers were 36% and 54 % of our total sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
Suppliers 
 
We have developed a strong collaborative relationship with a select few ISO Certified component manufacturers both domestically and in Asia. These strategic relationships have been developed over the past 20 years, which ensure that we are able to maintain a steady flow of components while maintaining a high level of quality. With these relationships we are able to run a production base on a just-in-time inventory (JIT) allowing us to keep a minimum amount of inventory.
Foreign Trade Regulations 
 
A large portion of the products we distribute are manufactured in Asia, including China. The purchase of goods manufactured in foreign countries is subject to several risks, including economic disruptions, including recent disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, transportation delays and interruptions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, imposition of tariffs and import and export controls, and changes in governmental policies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
From time to time, protectionist pressures have influenced U.S. trade policy concerning the imposition of significant duties or other trade restrictions upon foreign products. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. customs quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign components in the future or what effect any of these actions would have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. During 2022, we remained impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from China, which went into effect as of July 6, 2018. However, we also have been able to share the increases with our customers to help mitigate these costs.
 
Our ability to remain competitive with respect to the pricing of imported components could be adversely affected by increases in tariffs or duties, changes in trade treaties, strikes in air or sea transportation, and possible future U.S. legislation with respect to pricing and import quotas on products from foreign countries. For example, it is possible that political or economic developments in China, or with respect to the United States’ relationship with China, could have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to remain competitive also could be affected by other governmental actions related to, among other things, anti-dumping legislation and international currency fluctuations. While we do not believe that any of these factors adversely impact our business at present, we cannot be assured that these factors will not materially adversely affect us in the future. Any significant disruption in the delivery of merchandise from our suppliers, substantially all of whom are foreign, could have a material adverse impact on our business and the results of operations.
