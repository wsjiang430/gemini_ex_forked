Item 1. Business
Overview
 
Pulse Biosciences, Inc. is a novel bioelectric medicine company committed to health innovation using its patented Nano-Pulse Stimulation™ technology, a revolutionary energy modality that delivers nanosecond-duration pulses of electrical energy, each less than a millionth of a second long, to non-thermally clear targeted cells while sparing adjacent noncellular tissue. NPS technology, also referred to as Nanosecond Pulsed-Field Ablation™ or nsPFA™ technology when used to ablate cellular tissue, can be used to treat a variety of medical conditions for which an optimal solution remains unfulfilled. The Company developed its proprietary CellFX System®, a novel nsPFA delivery platform, and commercialized the initial application of its nsPFA technology to treat benign lesions of the skin. In parallel, the Company has designed a variety of applicators to explore the potential use of the CellFX platform to treat disorders in other medical specialties, such as cardiology, gastroenterology, gynecology, and ear nose and throat. These applicators include devices for open surgical procedures, endoscopic or minimally invasive procedures, and endoluminal catheters, and each has been used in preclinical studies. Based on our preclinical experience and the potential to significantly improve outcomes for patients in a large and growing market, the Company decided in 2022 to focus its efforts on the use of nsPFA and the CellFX platform in the treatment of atrial fibrillation ("AF").
 
AF is a type of heart arrythmia, or irregular heartbeat, caused by faulty electrical signals in the heart. AF is a highly prevalent condition and is growing significantly with an ageing population. It is estimated that 43 million people worldwide are affected by AF. Treatment requires the precise and safe ablation of heart tissue to block or otherwise prevent these faulty electrical signals from causing the irregular heartbeat, and we believe nsPFA technology is uniquely suited to perform an integral role for this application and that it will prove to be highly differentiated from standard thermal energy modalities in use today. The Company has developed a cardiac ablation clamp for use in cardiac surgery and a cardiac ablation catheter for use in electrophysiology and we are currently testing both in preclinical models. While these devices serve different physicians, the application of the energy to safely and effectively ablate cardiac tissue and the treatment of AF are the same, and we believe there will be important synergies realized through their contemporaneous development. The Company’s cardiac ablation clamp and cardiac ablation catheter both use the CellFX System to generate our proprietary pulses of electrical energy.
 
Our surgical cardiac ablation clamp is designed for use by cardiac surgeons during the surgical treatment of AF. The standard of care surgical procedure for the treatment of AF is performed by cardiac surgeons and called the Cox-Maze procedure. The Cox-Maze procedure typically uses thermal ablation technologies, such as heat with radiofrequency ablation or cold with cryoablation, to create specific ablation lines in the heart muscle. The ablation lines block the conduction of electrical impulses and can cure the patient of their atrial fibrillation.
 
We believe our nsPFA technology can provide important advantages over today’s thermal modalities in creating these ablation lines. For example, surgeons using the CellFX System should be able to deliver faster ablations through thicker tissue than thermal modalities because of the nonthermal mechanism of action that nsPFA employs, which is not affected by heatsinks such as the blood in the heart. Thermal modalities are also known to have problems with char formation on electrode surfaces which can cause gaps in the ablation lines leading to treatment failure and require the char to be scraped off by the surgeon during the procedure. Again, this should not be an issue with nsPFA ablation given its nonthermal nature. Because nsPFA ablation does not impact acellular tissue, such as collagen or cartilage, our technology has the potential to offer significant safety advantages over thermal modalities by allowing surgeons to ablate near and into vessels and valves without concern of permanent damage. And finally, nsPFA ablation has been shown to spare nerves of any permanent damage even when treated directly, which is another concern for thermal modalities. The Company believes these advantages will be profoundly important to cardiac surgeons treating AF, so it is working with leaders in the field to develop this technology quickly.

Over the last several years, we have been developing the cardiac ablation clamp from proof-of-concept to prototype, and we now have what we believe is our initial commercial design. The device was designed with the input of key physicians in cardiac surgery, and we believe it will offer a highly differentiated option relative to the standard of care thermal modalities. We plan to perform the necessary device testing in 2023 to prepare for human clinical use, including continued preclinical testing. In parallel with the continued testing of the device, we expect to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") to discuss the regulatory requirements for a potential FDA clearance or approval to market our cardiac clamp in the United States. This will be done as part of the FDA’s standard Q-submission process, also known as a pre-submission meeting. We expect that our first meeting on this topic with the FDA will take place in the second quarter of 2023.
 
We believe our cardiac catheter ablation device will have many of the same advantages that the cardiac ablation clamp has relative to both performance and safety compared to standard thermal modalities. Our catheter is uniquely designed to provide a circumferential, or circular, ablation in a single treatment cycle. We believe this will enable faster treatment times compared to what is currently performed with thermal modalities, especially when ablating around the pulmonary veins, a common treatment approach for AF.
 
In recent years, Pulsed Field Ablation ("PFA") has gained attention in electrophysiology for the treatment of AF as a result of its safety profile and potential to improve efficacy. PFA differs from nsPFA in that the pulse widths are longer, typically in the 10’s to 100’s of microseconds. We believe nsPFA can offer similar safety advantages as PFA and may provide improved efficacy advantages based on the circumferential design of our catheter and the potential that nsPFA can create deeper ablations. Another potential advantage of nsPFA ablation is a much shorter pulse duration which appears to stimulate less muscle contraction than does millisecond or microsecond PFA.
 
Similar to the cardiac ablation clamp, our proprietary catheter has been in development for several years and we have been working with leaders in the electrophysiology field to test the catheter in preclinical studies. We believe the design we have now will be suitable to pursue a first-in-human clinical safety study. We are in the testing phase of the development process and expect to complete additional safety and performance preclinical studies throughout 2023. Once completed, we believe we will be in a position to begin a first-in-human feasibility study. In the United States, we believe the catheter will need to go through the FDA’s Pre-Market Approval ("PMA") process for FDA approval to market and sell in the United States.  
 
The CellFX System
 
The CellFX System is a tunable, software-enabled, console-based platform, designed to accommodate the clinical workflow preferred by physicians. The CellFX System is configured to accept a variety of handpieces or electrodes across a range of clinical applications. In February 2021, the Company received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the CellFX System for dermatologic procedures requiring ablation and resurfacing of the skin. In January 2021, the Company received Conformité Européene (“CE”) marking approval for the CellFX System, which allows for marketing of the system in the European Union (“EU”). Shortly after these regulatory clearances the Company began commercializing the CellFX System in dermatology for the treatment of benign skin lesions. However, in September 2022, the Company announced a shift in its focus from dermatology to cardiology and the treatment of AF. The Company has ceased all commercial sales and marketing operations in dermatology. At the present time, we continue to support our remaining commercial users and remain open to a potential commercial partnership. The CellFX System is being used for our current efforts in the treatment of AF.
 
While we are not investing R&D resources in applications outside of cardiology and the treatment of AF, we continue to believe nsPFA ablation and NPS technology more broadly has the potential to provide superior outcomes across additional medical disciplines and we may seek partnership opportunities to develop additional applications.    
 
Intellectual Property
 
We maintain a portfolio of intellectual property surrounding our CellFX System and our NPS technology platform. As a medical technology company our current patents and ongoing intellectual property development are, and will continue to be, a priority for our business. We believe our intellectual property is an important competitive advantage for us. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to further develop, maintain, and strengthen our competitive position. We actively protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent registrations, trademarks, and copyright protections; confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and other parties; and access control to sensitive information.
 
Today, on a worldwide basis, we own 165 issued patents and pending patent applications, and we have an exclusive license to 72 additional issued patents and pending patent applications. The vast majority of our granted patents have an expiration date between 2035 and 2041. As in the past, we plan to continue to file new patent applications to protect our systems, algorithms, applicators, methods, and designs of our technologies and products as they evolve. Medical technologies such as ours may be utilized in many different applications and incorporate several patentable features, and our strategy will be to always strive to protect our products and technologies with multiple patents directed to the variety of features and applications, in order to establish a strong and useful patent portfolio against competitors, such that an expiration of a single patent should not lessen our overall comprehensive coverage and competitive advantage. We believe our NPS platform and CellFX System are protected by several issued patents, as well as pending applications.
 
Employees and Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 61 employees, of which substantially all were located at our headquarters in Hayward, California. Of these employees, 39 were engaged in research and development activities and 22 were engaged in sales, marketing, business development, and general and administrative activities.
Talent Acquisition and Development. We are committed to providing a respectful work environment to our diverse workforce. We provide equal employment opportunities to all persons regardless of race, age, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, physical or mental disability, religion, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.
 
    4 

  

We believe our employees are essential to our success and our ability to attract, develop, and retain key talent is a vital part of that. Our philosophy is to both develop talent from within and to strategically recruit key external talent. Our overall talent acquisition and retention strategy is designed to attract and retain diverse and qualified candidates to enable the success of the Company and achievement of our performance goals. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance.
 
Compensation and Benefits Program. Our compensation program is designed to attract, motivate, and retain talented individuals who possess the skills necessary to support our business and contribute to our strategic goals, creating long-term value for our stockholders. We provide employees with competitive compensation packages that include base salary, annual incentive bonuses, 401(k), and equity awards tied to the value of our stock price. Our comprehensive benefits package also includes medical, dental, vision, life and disability plans, and an employee assistance program.
Wellness and Safety. The health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. We currently operate under a hybrid model of onsite and remote work with our technical teams being mostly back onsite on a full-time basis. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to require employees to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and have policies and guidelines which are designed to protect the safety of our employees.
Competition
 
The applications we intend to target are subject to intense competition from rapidly evolving companies and new scientific discoveries. We compete against well-established incumbent technologies offering products in cardiology, oncology, and dermatology, as well as in minimally invasive procedures. For example, Abbott Laboratories, AtriCure, Inc., Boston Scientific Corporation, Johnson & Johnson (Biosense Webster), Medtronic plc, and several other companies all sell ablation-based surgical and catheter-based medical devices for the treatment of heart arrhythmias, including AF, and additionally, many of these companies are also actively developing PFA products for the treatment of AF. All of these companies currently have greater financial, technical, research, and/or other resources than we do and have larger and more established manufacturing capabilities and marketing, sales, and support functions. Our future success will depend on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies. Our technology is unique and differentiated in that NPS technology can influence many cellular functions depending on the energy applied. When it is used to stimulate primarily regulated cell death, such as through nsPFA ablation, we believe it would be less traumatic to treated tissue and would result in less scarring or collateral damage to surrounding tissues, which we feel will give us a competitive advantage over these more established companies despite formidable competition. 
Government Regulation
 
The CellFX System is a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance.
 
The FDA regulates the medical device market to ensure the safety and efficacy of these products. For medical devices that require pre-market review, the FDA allows for three clearance/approval pathways for a medical device to be commercialized: approval via a Pre-market Approval Application (“PMA”), clearance of a 510(k) submission, or submission of a de novo application. The FDA has established three different classes of medical devices, based on the level of risk associated with using a device and consequent degree of regulatory controls needed to govern its safety and efficacy, as well as the appropriate clearance/approval pathway needed to obtain authorization to legally market a medical device in the United States.
 
    5 

  

Class I and Class II devices are considered low and moderate risk devices. Most Class I devices are exempt from premarket notification. Most Class II devices require 510(k) clearance from the FDA in order to be marketed in the U.S. A 510(k) Premarket Notification is a premarket submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed Class II device, i.e., a predicate device. Companies making a 510(k) submission must compare their 510(k)-candidate device to a predicate device and establish substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of FDA. A device previously cleared under 510(k) or a device approved through a de novo application can be used as a predicate device for later developed substantially equivalent medical devices. However, establishing substantial equivalence in a 510(k) submission requires the candidate device to have the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as a predicate device. The FDA has a 90-calendar day review goal from the date of receipt of the 510(k) to either authorize or decline commercial distribution of the device, but clearance generally takes longer than 90 days. During the review process, the FDA may also request additional information which extends the review process. If the FDA decides that the product is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, a clearance will not be granted, and the device cannot be commercialized. If a 510(k) submission is rejected by FDA, the applicant may be required to seek premarket authorization through the de novo pathway or the premarket approval pathway, which are more costly and will generally take longer for FDA approval.
 
Medical devices regarded as the highest risk by the FDA are typically designated Class III and generally require the submission of a PMA application for approval. Class III devices generally include life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices or devices without a known predicate technology already approved by the FDA. A PMA application must be accompanied by substantial data that supports the reasonable safety and efficacy of the device, which includes the provision of preclinical, clinical, technical, manufacturing, and labeling information. After the FDA determines the application is sufficiently complete to commence a substantive review, it has 180 days to review the submission, but it can typically take longer (up to several years) as this regulatory body can request additional data, including clinical data or clarifications. The FDA may also impose additional regulatory scrutiny for a PMA, including the institution of an outside advisory committee (panel review) to assess the application or provide recommendations as to whether to approve the device. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendation of an advisory panel, it generally does. As part of the review, the FDA will also inspect the manufacturing operations of the Company requesting approval to verify compliance with Quality System regulations.
 
If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) premarket notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and efficacy of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplemental approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with the determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplement, the FDA may retroactively require a new 510(k) clearance or PMA Supplements to be submitted. The FDA could also require a manufacturer to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until clearance or approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines, penalties, and possible warning letters.

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
 
Even after a device is placed on the market with FDA clearance or approval, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 

● | the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA and FTC prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers, and we must comply with the post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting regulations. We are required to report to the FDA information if a device has, or may have, caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury, if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report events required to be reported to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action and impose sanctions against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, would require our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 
We may be subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Public Health to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 

● | warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | repair, replacement, refunds, recall, or seizure of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approval that has already been granted; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.

Regulatory System for Medical Devices in Europe
 
The European Union (the “EU”) consists of 27-member states and has a coordinated system for the authorization of medical devices. Marketing medical devices in the EU is subject to compliance with the Medical Devices Directive 93/92/EEC (MDD) and the European Union Medical Device Regulation (2017/745 or EU MDR) following its entry into application on May 26, 2020. A medical device may be placed on the market within the EU only if it conforms to certain “essential requirements” and bears the CE Mark. The most fundamental and essential requirement is that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the essential performance(s) intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner.
 
Manufacturers must demonstrate that their devices conform to the relevant essential requirements through a conformity assessment procedure. The nature of the assessment depends upon the classification of the device. The classification rules are mainly based on three criteria: (i) the length of time the device is in contact with the body, (ii) the degree of invasiveness, and (iii) the extent to which the device affects the anatomy. Conformity assessment procedures for all but the lowest risk classification of device involve a notified body. Notified bodies are often private entities and are authorized or licensed to perform such assessments by government authorities. Manufacturers usually have some flexibility to select a notified body for the conformity assessment procedures for a particular class of device and to reflect their circumstances, e.g., the likelihood that the manufacturer will make frequent modifications to its products. Conformity assessment procedures require an assessment of available clinical evidence, literature data for the product, and post-market experience in respect of similar products already marketed. Notified bodies also may review the manufacturer’s quality systems. If satisfied that the product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity and application of the CE Mark. Application of the CE Mark allows the general commercializing of a product in the EU. The product can also be subjected to local registration requirements depending on the country.
 
    7 

  

The EU MDR, which repealed and replaced the MDD, entered into force on May 25, 2017 with a transition period extending until May 26, 2021. The EU MDR clearly envisages, among other things, stricter controls of medical devices, including strengthening of the conformity assessment procedures, increased expectations with respect to clinical data for devices, and pre-market regulatory review of high-risk devices. The EU MDR also envisages greater control over notified bodies and their standards, increased transparency, more robust device vigilance requirements, and clarification of the rules for clinical investigations. Under transitional provisions, medical devices with notified body certificates issued under the MDD prior to May 26, 2020, and which have not been significantly changed, may continue to be placed on the market for the remaining validity of the certificate, until December 2028 at the latest. After the expiry of any applicable transitional period, only devices that have been CE marked under the EU MDR may be placed on the market in the EU.
 
U.S. Healthcare Reform
 
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues, and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts our industry. The Affordance Care Act contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes.
 
There will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our current and future solutions or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future solutions from governmental agencies or third-party payors. While in general it is too early to predict specifically what effect the Affordable Care Act and its implementation or any future healthcare reform legislation or policies will have on our business, current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
Environmental
 
We are subject to federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling, and disposal of certain hazardous and potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our operations. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects and, to date, have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations in the future. 
Insurance
 
We maintain product and clinical trial liability insurance coverage which includes a maximum of per claim and annual aggregate policy limits, subject to self-insured retentions. The policy covers, subject to policy conditions and exclusions, claims of bodily injury and property damage from any product manufactured by us or from trial-related adverse events.
 
There is no assurance that our level of coverage is adequate. We may not be able to sustain or maintain our current level of coverage and cannot assure you that adequate insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A successful product liability claim may exceed our existing coverages and may make future coverages significantly more expensive, if available at all.
 
In May 2022, the Company determined not to renew its annual director and officer liability insurance policy due to disproportionately high premiums quoted by insurance companies. Instead, on May 31, 2022, the Company and Robert W. Duggan, the Company's Executive Chairman, entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which Mr. Duggan has agreed with the Company to personally provide indemnity coverage for a one-year period, and he has agreed to deposit cash and/or marketable securities into a third-party escrow, as security for these obligations, if requested by the Company. The Company will pay a fee of $1.0 million to Mr. Duggan that shall be due on May 31, 2023, the last day of the one-year period, in consideration of the obligations set forth in the Letter Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the amount owed to Mr. Duggan under the Letter Agreement was $0.6 million, recorded on the balance sheet under accrued expenses.
