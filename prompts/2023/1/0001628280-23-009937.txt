Item 1. Business
4Front Ventures Corp. (“4Front” or the “Company”) is a multi-state cannabis operator and retailer, with a market advantage in mass-produced, low-cost, quality branded cannabis products. The Company manufactures and distributes a portfolio of over 25 cannabis brands including Marmas, Crystal Clear, Island, Verdure, and the Pure Ratios wellness collection, distributed through retail outlets, as well as the Company’s chain of branded dispensaries. From plant genetics to automated manufacturing to the cannabis retail experience, 4Front’s team applies expertise across the entire cannabis value chain. 
Overview
The Company exists pursuant to the provisions of the British Columbia Corporations Act. On July 31, 2019, 4Front Holdings LLC (“Holdings”) completed a Reverse Takeover Transaction (“RTO”) with Cannex Capital Holdings, Inc. (“Cannex”) whereby Holdings acquired Cannex and the shareholders of Holdings became the controlling shareholders of the Company. Following the RTO, the Company’s SVS are listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”) under the ticker “FFNT” and are quoted on the OTCQX under the ticker “FFNTF”.
The Company has two primary operating segments: THC Cannabis and CBD Wellness. With regard to its THC Cannabis segment, as of December 31, 2022, the Company operated six dispensaries in Massachusetts, Illinois, and Michigan, primarily under the “MISSION” brand name. Also, as of December 31, 2022, the Company operated three cultivation and production facilities in Massachusetts, three facilities in California, and one facility in Illinois. The Company produces the majority of products that are sold at its Massachusetts and Illinois dispensaries.
The Company’s CBD Wellness segment is focused upon its ownership and operation of its wholly owned subsidiary, Pure Ratios Holdings, Inc. (“Pure Ratios”), a CBD-focused wellness company in California, that sells non-THC products throughout the United States.
While marijuana is legal under the laws of several U.S. states (with varying restrictions), the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act classifies all “marijuana” as a Schedule I drug, whether for medical or recreational use. Under U.S. federal law, a Schedule I drug or substance has a high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of safety data for the use of the drug under medical supervision.
Recent Developments
Merger with New England Cannabis Corporation
On January 28, 2022, the Company completed a merger acquisition for 100% of New England Cannabis Corporation (“NECC”) which increased the Company's presence in Massachusetts and the northeastern United States, more than doubling the Company’s total flower canopy in Massachusetts and scaling its presence as a dominant wholesaler and producer in the state. Refer to Note 7 of the financial statements for a full details on the NECC Merger and the related transactions.
Merger with Island Global Holdings, Inc.
On April 25, 2022, the Company completed a merger acquisition for 100% of Island Global Holdings, Inc.

Following the acquisition of the premier California cannabis brand, the Company began cultivating 11 new Island flower strains at its state-of-art flower facilities located in Holliston, Georgetown and Worcester, Massachusetts. Refer to Note 7 of the financial statements for a full description of the Company’s entrance into the Island Merger Agreement and related transactions.

Asset Acquisition of Bloom Farms
On August 19, 2022, the Company completed an asset acquisition to acquire certain assets of Bloom Farms and Bloom Farms Wellness brands (collectively, “Bloom Farms”) which increased the Company's brand portfolio in the California market. Bloom Farms’ cannabis products include vapes and concentrates, while its wellness line offers a hemp-derived selection of vapes, tinctures, and topicals. Refer to Note 7 of the financial statements for a further information on the transaction.
Opening of Commerce, CA Facility
In January 2022, the Company commenced operations at its state-of-the-art production facility in Commerce, California with 170,000 square feet of manufacturing space, which allows the Company to develop and acquire brands and manufacture them significantly quickly, cheaper and more profitably, seamlessly integrating into 4Front’s production lines – a key differentiator in its California growth strategy. 4Front is more confident than ever that it is uniquely positioned to be disruptive in a California market that is ripe for consolidation and streamlining of cost efficiencies. 
Construction of Matteson, IL Facility
The Company is on track to substantially complete construction of the cultivation and production facility in Matteson, Illinois in the fiscal second quarter of 2023, with operations expected to commence in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.
In November 2022, the Company amended its lease agreement for the Matteson facility by increasing the tenant improvement allowance under the lease by $19.9 million; extending the term of the lease to 20 years after the amendment; increasing the base rent by $0.2 million per month (abated until April 1, 2023); and increasing the security deposit by $2.2 million, to be funded pro rata out of draws on the tenant improvement allowance.
Executive Management Changes
Effective June 9, 2022, the Company’s board of directors appointed Keith Adams as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer. A description of Mr. Adams' business experience and executive compensation is included in "Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" and "Item 11. Executive Compensation" in this Form 10-K.
On June 9, 2022, Andrew Thut resigned his position as Interim Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Thut, the Company's Chief Investment Officer, was appointed as Interim Chief Financial Officer on July 15, 2021. Mr. Thut will continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Investment Officer.
Effective June 14, 2022, the Company terminated the position of Chief Operating Officer in order to further streamline the Company’s internal reporting structure.

Executive Compensation" in this Form 10-K.

COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and continues to affect employers, employees, communities and business operations. Management continues to actively monitor the developments regarding the pandemic and assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry, our company, and most importantly, the health and safety of our workforce. To date, we have been able to continue our operations and do not anticipate any material interruptions in the foreseeable future. However, the uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business operations for reasons including the potential quarantine of our employees or those of our supply chain partners, the impact on consumer purchasing behavior, and the extent to which it affects our ability to raise capital.
Business
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had two business segments:
•THC Cannabis – Cultivation, production, manufacturing and distribution of of THC cannabis products to owned dispensaries and third party retailers, ancillary services supporting wholesale operations, and retail sales direct to end consumers
•CBD Wellness – Pure Ratios encompasses the production and sale of CBD products to third-party customers via a national direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform 
THC Cannabis - Retail
As part of its THC Cannabis segment, the Company owns and operates three dispensaries in Massachusetts, two dispensaries in Illinois, and one dispensary in Michigan. The Company leases the real estate a tall three Massachusetts dispensaries, the Calument City, Illinois dispensary and the Ann Arbor, Michigan dispensary. The Company owns the real estate at its South Shore, Illinois dispensary.
The Company’s dispensaries are branded under the “MISSION” retail brand. The dispensaries sell products which are either: (1) purchased from licensed cannabis producers in the state in which they operate, if allowed under state law and regulation; or, (2) transferred from the Company’s owned production operations within the relevant state market as in the case of markets where “vertical integration” is allowed (i.e. jurisdictions in which the Company can and does own both retail and production cannabis assets such as Illinois or Massachusetts). Product availability varies depending on conditions in the Company’s key retail markets, and the performance of the Company’s own production assets. Interstate commerce of cannabis is illegal under state and federal law and therefore the Company may not transfer inventory between key markets currently.
The Company is focused on expanding its own production assets in order to provide better product availability for the retail segments, especially focusing on increasing supply of high-quality dried cannabis flower including markets where such product is in relatively short supply, such as Illinois and Massachusetts.
Generally, the Company sells cannabis packaged goods in accordance with applicable state law and regulation through retail dispensaries (i.e. in store). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has expanded its services in certain markets to accommodate online ordering, curbside pickup and delivery where such activities are permitted by applicable state law and regulation.

The Company operates age-gated online platforms (https://4frontventures.com/ and https://missiondispensaries.com/) for patients and customers of its dispensaries (the “Online Platform”). The content of such websites is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report or filed with the SEC. Prior to launching the Online Platform, the Company’s compliance team and internal and external counsel undertook a review of the applicable federal and state privacy, advertising and cannabis laws and launched the Online Platform in a manner intended to ensure compliance with such laws. The Online Platform allows patients and customers to understand the cannabis products that the Company offers and view real-time pricing and product availability at the Company’s dispensaries, and as a repository of miscellaneous corporate and investor information. The Online Platform does not provide any education, information or any other functionalities with respect to any third-party dispensaries.
No purchase or sale transactions occur on the Online Platform. A patient or customer may reserve products using the Online Platform, but the patient or customer must be physically present at one of the Company’s dispensaries to consummate the purchase and sale of products. This requirement allows the Company and dispensary staff to ensure that the Company’s standard operating procedures (including its compliance program(s)) are applied to all patients and customers in connection with the purchase and sale of products.
In jurisdictions where medical cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the patient at the applicable dispensary, dispensary staff must verify the patient’s identity and accreditation (such as a state-issued medical cannabis card) and confirm the patient’s allotment to ensure the user is not exceeding the state’s allotment limits. Once the foregoing is verified, the patient may pay for the product(s) to complete the purchase. If the customer does not have valid identification and accreditation, the customer will not be able to purchase medical cannabis at the applicable Company dispensary, irrespective of any reservation(s) made on the Online Platform.
In jurisdictions where recreational cannabis is legal, upon arrival of the customer at the applicable dispensary, dispensary staff must verify that the customer is at least 21 years of age by verifying the customer’s government-issued identification. Once the identification is verified, the customer may pay for the product(s) to complete the transaction. If the customer does not have valid identification, the customer will not be able to purchase recreational cannabis at the applicable Company dispensary, irrespective of any reservation(s) made on the Online Platform.
THC Cannabis - Cultivation & Production
As part of its THC Cannabis segment, the Company operates three facilities in Massachusetts, one facility in Illinois and three facilities in California. The Company leases all of these facilities. The Company produces dried cannabis flower and trim, extracted cannabis products such as wax and distillate, and cannabis infused edible products in its production facilities.
The production segment utilizes certain raw materials to produce cannabis flowers and other extracted products. To produce and dry cannabis flower, the Company utilizes growing medium, nutrients, water, electrical power, soil adjuvants, and certain beneficial pests as part of its integrated pest management efforts. There are many sources for such products (except for water and power, which are provided by the local utility), and prices are reflective of commodity pricing worldwide. Some of these raw material inputs are sourced internationally, so changes in import laws or duties are a potential risk. The prices of power and water are generally stable and set through processes that involve governmental approvals over any increases, but the prices of growing medium, nutrients, etc. are all at least somewhat exposed to underlying commodity price volatility.
For extract products, an additional input is butane or propane for use as a solvent. These gases are largely a commodity, their pricing is reflective of worldwide conditions, and they are supplied to the Company’s operations by local suppliers of industrial gases and materials in the relevant jurisdictions. Prices for such inputs may be volatile, as with any other commodity.
8


The Company employs certain state registered and unregistered trademarks in association with its cannabis goods, including the dried cannabis flower brands “ISLAND”, “LEGENDS” and “PRIVATE RESERVE,” the edibles brands “CHEWEE’S”, “HI-BURST:, “MARMAS” and “VERDURE,” and the extracts brands “DABL”, “GOLDEN GOO” and “CRYSTAL CLEAR”.
CBD Wellness
The Company’s CBD Wellness segment is focused upon its ownership and operation of its wholly owned subsidiary, Pure Ratios. Pure Ratios is a cannabidiol (“CBD”) products company in California that sells a variety of CBD products, both directly to consumer, business to business, and through third party fulfillment vendors. The products include CBD patches, salves, roll-ons, and tablets containing CBD with apoptogenic mushroom ingredients. Pure Ratios produces certain base ingredients, such as the CBD plus proprietary ingredient mixtures which are then injected into the finished patches by contract manufacturers. The Company also sells its Pure Ratios branded products through its CBD e-commerce platform www.pureratios.com. The content of such websites is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report or filed with the SEC.
The Pure Ratios segment utilizes certain raw materials to produce its CBD source materials, as do its contract manufacturers. These products include CBD source material, and certain herbs and other Ayurvedic ingredients which are part of Pure Ratios’ formulations. These raw materials are generally commodities and their prices are reflective of worldwide commodity prices and volatility.
Pure Ratios utilizes reservoir patch technology, trade secrets and other intangible know-how in the creation and formulation of the proprietary blend of herbs and other ingredients which are combined with CBD in its products.
Pure Ratios creates certain of its CBD source materials through its proprietary processes and techniques, but creation and assembly of finished goods (e.g. salves, patches, etc.) is contracted to third party contract manufacturers. Additionally, Pure Ratios contracts with an internet sales organization which advertises Pure Ratios products, and then fulfills those products as well. Pure Ratios is therefore economically dependent on such third party manufacturers, and the third party advertising/fulfillment company.
In 2020, the market experienced a significant decrease in pricing across CBD products as additional suppliers entered the market. However, if federal and state policies change in favor of the industry, and if the FDA begins to test and regulate the quality of related consumer products, the downward trend in pricing could reverse. Please see the “Description of the U.S. Legal Cannabis Industry” section for further information on the regulatory landscape in which the Company operates.

Regulatory Matters 
United States Federal Regulation of the Cannabis Market
Marijuana (the dried flowers, leaves, stems, and seeds of the cannabis plant) is illegal under U.S. federal law, and enforcement of relevant laws governing marijuana-related activities is a significant risk for the Company. The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through, among other things, the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”), 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq., which places controlled substances, including marijuana, in a schedule. Marijuana is a Schedule I drug. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as having no currently accepted medical use, a high potential for abuse and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. With the limited exception of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approving Epidiolex (cannabidiol) (CBD) oral solution for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, the FDA has not approved any other cannabis or cannabis-derived compound as a safe and effective drug for any indication. The FDA has approved Marinol and Syndros for therapeutic uses in the U.S., including for the treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in AIDS patients. Marinol and Syndros include the active ingredient dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Another FDA-approved drug, Cesamet, contains the active ingredient nabilone, which has a chemical structure similar to THC and is synthetically derived.
Unlike in Canada, which has federal legislation governing the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of medical and adult-use cannabis, cannabis is largely regulated at the state level in the United States.
State laws regulating cannabis are in direct conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal. As of December 31, 2022, at least 39 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have legalized cannabis for medical use, and 21 of those states and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam have legalized adult use of cannabis for recreational purposes. Although many states and territories have and continue to legalize cannabis production and distribution by licensed entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation, and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia remains illegal under any and all circumstances. 
On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum to all U.S. Attorneys in which he rescinded previous guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) specific to cannabis enforcement in the United States, including a memorandum drafted by former Deputy Attorney General James Michael Cole in 2013 (the “Cole Memorandum”). With the Cole Memorandum rescinded, U.S. federal prosecutors have been given discretion in determining whether to prosecute cannabis related violations of U.S. federal law. 
On November 7, 2018, Mr. Sessions resigned and William Barr was sworn in as United States Attorney General. During his confirmation hearing on January 15, 2019, Mr. Barr pledged not to pursue marijuana companies that comply with state law. This pledge was made in writing, when responding to written questions from Senators: “As discussed in my hearing, I do not intend to go after parties who have complied with the state law in reliance on the Cole Memorandum.” During William Barr’s tenure as Attorney General, DOJ did not pursue marijuana companies that comply with state law.
On March 10, 2021, the U.S. Senate confirmed President Biden’s nominee for Attorney General, Merrick Garland. During his confirmation hearing on February 22, 2021, Garland said, among other things, that “It does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have, to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and that are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise. I don’t think that’s a useful use. I do think we need to be sure there are no end-runs around the state laws that criminal enterprises are doing. So that kind of enforcement should be continued. But I don’t think it’s a good use of our resources, where states have already authorized. That only confuses people, obviously, within the state.” To date, there have been no new federal cannabis memorandums issued by the DOJ or any published change in federal enforcement policy.

On October 6, 2022, President Biden directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to initiate the administrative process to review expeditiously how marijuana is scheduled under U.S. federal law. Simultaneously, Biden also announced a pardon of all prior federal simple possession of marijuana offenses and urged state governors to do the same with regard to state level offenses.
For fiscal years 2015 through 2018, Congress adopted budget riders to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts (sometimes referred to as the Rohrabacher-Farr or Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment after its original lead sponsor, and now referred to as the Joyce Amendment after its current lead sponsor) to prevent the federal government from using appropriated funds to enforce federal marijuana laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment was included in the fiscal year 2018 budget passed on March 23, 2018. 
On September 27, 2019, the Joyce Amendment was renewed as part of a stopgap spending bill, in effect through November 21, 2019. On December 27, 2020, the Joyce Amendment was approved as part of the omnibus spending bill for fiscal year 2021, effective through September 30, 2021. Congress has since been renewed the amendment several times, on September 30, 2021, December 3, 2021, February 18, 2022, and March 11, 2022. On March 15, 2022 the amendment was renewed through the signing of the fiscal year 2022 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2022. As of December 29, 2022, the Joyce Amendment is effective through September 30, 2023.
United States Federal Regulation of the Industrial Hemp
On December 20, 2018, the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly known as the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law. The 2018 Farm Bill, among other things, removes industrial hemp and its derivatives, including cannabidiol (“CBD”), from the CSA and amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to allow for industrial hemp production and sale in the United States. Under the Farm Bill, industrial hemp is defined as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.”
The 2018 Farm Bill did not legalize CBD derived from “marijuana” (as such term is defined in the CSA), which is and remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) is responsible for promulgating regulations under the 2018 Farm Bill. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, U.S. territories and tribal governments may adopt their own regulatory plans for hemp production even if more restrictive than federal regulations so long as they meet minimum federal standards approved by the USDA. Those territories or tribal governments which choose not to adopt their own hemp production regulations will be governed by USDA regulations.
On January 15, 2021, USDA issued its final hemp production program rule. The rule outlines various USDA requirements for state and tribal hemp programs and provides a process for submitted productions plans to the USDA for approval or rejection within 60 days of submission.
The 2018 Farm Bill also preserved the FDA’s authority related to the introduction of hemp and hemp-derived compounds, such as CBD, in foods, beverages, cosmetics, and dietary supplements. The FDA’s current view is that it is unlawful under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as, or in, dietary supplements. When a substance is excluded from the dietary supplement definition in the FD&C Act, like CBD is, the FDA can issue a regulation, after notice and comment, finding that CBD would be lawful under the FD&C Act. On January 26, 2023, the FDA announced that it has convened an internal working group to explore new potential regulatory pathways for CBD products, but as of the date of this annual report, has not yet proposed any regulations. 
17


With regard to topical CBD products (i.e., cosmetics), the FDA has said that CBD is not a prohibited cosmetic ingredient (i.e., that CBD topicals are permissible) as long as the product is not intended to affect the structure or function of the body, or to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease. Despite the FDA’s position on ingestible CBD products, to date, the FDA has not taken enforcement action against producers of such products absent therapeutic claims being made about use of such products. More specifically, the FDA has only issued Warning Letters to producers of ingestible CBD products for making therapeutic claims—with a focus on more aggressive claims—involving the treatment of conditions such as COVID-19, AIDS, diabetes, post-traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, neuropathy, chronic pain, and anxiety. So far, selling an ingestible CBD product, but not making treatment claims about the same, has not resulted in an FDA enforcement action. Accordingly, even though ingestible CBD products violate the FD&C Act, the FDA does not seem interested in pursuing enforcement action against such products unless they bear therapeutic claims. FDA has also issued Warning Letters to producers of topical CBD products that bear pain relief claims, for falsely claiming that products are FDA-registered, for falsely claiming that products are over-the-counter (“OTC”) drugs, for including OTC drug ingredients in a CBD product without approval to do so, and for violating current good manufacturing practices (“cGMPs”).
Since the cultivation, processing, production, distribution, and sale of cannabis for any purpose, medical, adult use or otherwise, remains illegal under U.S. federal law, it is possible that we may be forced to cease activities. The United States federal government, through the DOJ, its sub agency the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, among other agencies, has the right to actively investigate, audit and shut down cannabis growing facilities, processors and retailers.
United States State Regulation of the Cannabis Market in the States in Which We Operate
California
In 1996, California voters passed Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act allowing physicians to legally recommend medical cannabis for patients who would benefit from cannabis. In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills, collectively known as the “Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act.” In November 2016, voters in California passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Cannabis Act (“AUMA”) creating an adult-use cannabis program for individuals 21 years of age or older. In June 2017, the California State Legislature passed the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act, which combined the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act and AUMA to provide a set of regulations to govern medical and adult-use licensing regime for cannabis businesses. 
On July 12, 2021, California consolidated its cannabis regulations into the newly created Department of Cannabis Control (the “DCC”). The DCC was created in an effort to centralize regulatory authority and facilitate a more easily navigable regulatory regime. All licenses obtained under the previous regulatory authorities automatically transferred to the DCC, which is now responsible for issuing and renewing all cannabis licenses. On September 8, 2021 the DCC issued emergency regulations consolidating medicinal and adult-use commercial cannabis rules.
We own subsidiaries that hold local permits and provisional and annual state licenses allowing for adult-use and medicinal commercial cannabis cultivation, manufacturing (volatile extraction), and distribution. Our subsidiary, Pure Ratios Holdings Inc., is engaged in the sale of hemp products, and also the licensing of certain intellectual property to entities which are directly involved in various state cannabis operations.
18


Illinois
In January 2014, the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act, which allows individuals diagnosed with certain debilitating or “qualified” medical conditions to access medical marijuana, became effective in Illinois. In January 2019, the Illinois Department of Health launched the Opioid Alternative Pilot Program, that allows individuals who receive or are eligible to receive a prescription for opioids to access to medical marijuana. In June 2019, Illinois legalized adult use marijuana pursuant to the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, and effective January 1, 2020, Illinois residents 21 years of age and older may possess up to 30 grams of marijuana (non- residents may possess up to 15 grams).
There are four main categories of licenses available in Illinois: cultivation centers, including processing; infusers; transporters; and dispensaries. Dispensaries are regulated by the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation and the remaining categories are regulated by the Illinois Department of Agriculture. Licenses are independently issued for each approved activity. All licenses must be renewed annually, except for adult use dispensing organization licenses which are every two years. In addition, the agents of each licensee, such as employees, must also be licensed. Licensed operations must also remain compliant with a number of statutory and regulatory standards, including, without limitation: storage requirements, transportation requirements and inventory tracking through the State’s official seed-to-sale vendor, BioTrack THC.
We are the beneficial owner of one dispensary license (allowing for the operation of two dispensaries) and one cultivation/production license in Illinois.
Massachusetts
On November 6, 2012, Massachusetts voters approved a ballot initiative legalizing medical marijuana effective January 1, 2013. On November 8, 2016, Massachusetts voters approved a second ballot initiative legalizing adult-use marijuana and creating the Cannabis Control Commission (the “CCC”), the regulatory body responsible for overseeing both the medical and adult-use markets in Massachusetts. The adult-use provisions for home use and cultivation took effect on December 15, 2016, and, after some initial delays, the provisions for licensed recreational sales went into effect in November 2018.
There are several categories of licenses available in Massachusetts, including those for: (i) medical marijuana treatment center (“MTC”), which are vertically integrated businesses that cultivate, process, and retail their own marijuana and marijuana products for medical use, (ii) marijuana cultivators (“MCs”), which are businesses licensed to cultivate, process, and package cannabis and to transfer marijuana to other marijuana establishments(“MEs”)—but not to consumers, and (iii) marijuana retailers (“MR”), which are businesses authorized to purchase and transport marijuana and marijuana products from other MEs, and sell or otherwise transfer marijuana and marijuana products to other MEs and consumers through retail locations which may generally only be accessed by consumers who are 21 years or older. MEs include craft marijuana cooperative, cultivator (indoor or outdoor), independent testing laboratory, marijuana courier, marijuana delivery operator, marijuana research facility, microbusiness, product manufacturer, retailer, social consumption establishment, standards laboratory, transporter, or any other type of adult-use marijuana business. all as defined and licensed by the CCC, but exclude MTCs.
All licenses must be renewed annually, except for adult use dispensing organization licenses which are every two years. In addition, the agents of each certain licensee, such as owners, employees and volunteers, must register with the CCC. Licensed operations must also remain compliant with a number of statutory and regulatory standards, including, without limitation: storage requirements, transportation requirements and recordkeeping and inventory tracking requirements.
We own three MTC licenses for retail, cultivation and processing, two adult use MR licenses, and two adult use MC licenses.
19


Michigan
In 2008, Michigan voters approved an initiative to legalizing medical marijuana effective November 4, 2008. In September 2016, the Michigan legislature passed the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act and the Marihuana Tracking Act, which, together, established a licensing, regulatory and tracking framework for the medical marijuana market in Michigan.
On November 6, 2018, Michigan voters approved the Michigan Regulation and Taxations of Marihuana Act (“MRTMA”), legalizing adult-use marijuana and established a licensing and regulatory framework for the adult-use market in Michigan. MRTMA took effect on December 6, 2018 and the first public dispensaries opened in Michigan on December 1, 2019.
Effective April 13, 2022, the Cannabis Regulatory Agency (“CRA”) (formerly the Marijuana Regulatory Agency) became the main regulatory body for overseeing both the medical and adult-use markets in Michigan.
There are several categories of licenses available in Michigan, including those for medical provisioning centers, and adult use retailers. All licenses must be renewed annually. Licensed operations must also remain compliant with a number of statutory and regulatory standards, including, without limitation: storage requirements, transportation requirements and recordkeeping and inventory tracking requirements through Metrc, Michigan’s seed-to-sale marijuana inventory tracking system.
We own one medical provisioning center license and one adult use dispensary license.
Applicable Banking and Financial Services Laws and Regulations
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve banking, money laundering, financial record-keeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the “Bank Secrecy Act”), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States. We are also subject to similar laws and regulations in Canada, including the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (Canada), as amended. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be found guilty of money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy.
Despite these laws, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”) outlining the pathways for financial institutions to back state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These cannabis-related SARs are divided into three categories—cannabis limited, cannabis priority, and cannabis terminated—based on the financial institution’s belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively.
20


The FinCEN Memorandum states that in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. The FinCEN Memorandum does not, however, provide banks or other financial institutions with any safe harbors or legal defenses from examination or regulatory or criminal enforcement actions by the DOJ, FinCEN or other federal regulators. In addition, the FinCEN Memorandum can be amended or revoked at any time. As a result, most banks and other financial institutions in the United States do not appear comfortable providing banking services to the cannabis industry.
In addition to the foregoing, banks may refuse to process debit card payments and credit card companies generally refuse to process credit card payments for cannabis-related businesses. As a result, we may have limited or no access to banking or other financial services in the United States. In addition, federal money laundering statutes and Bank Secrecy Act regulations discourage financial institutions from working with any organization that sells a controlled substance, regardless of whether the state it resides in permits cannabis sales. 
While the U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Secure and Fair Enforcement (“SAFE”) Act multiple times, which would permit federally insured banking institutions and related service providers, such as insurers, to offer services to cannabis companies that are in compliance with state law, it has never passed in the U.S. Senate.
Constraints on Marketing Products
The development of the Company’s business and operating results may be hindered by applicable restrictions on sales and marketing activities imposed by government regulatory bodies for products containing cannabis or ingredients derived from cannabis, including but not limited, to the FDA, USDA, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and state regulatory agencies that may institute new regulatory requirements. The regulatory environment in the United States limits the Company’s ability to compete for market share in a manner similar to other industries. If the Company is unable to effectively market its products and compete for market share, or if the costs of compliance with government legislation and regulation cannot be absorbed through increased selling prices for its products, the Company’s sales and operating results could be adversely affected.
Tax Risks Related to Controlled Substances
Limits on U.S. deductibility of certain expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Section 280E (“Section 280E”) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) prohibits businesses from deducting certain expenses associated with the trafficking of controlled substances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the CSA). IRS has applied Section 280E in tax audits against various cannabis businesses in the U.S. that are permitted under applicable state laws. Although the IRS issued a clarification allowing the deduction of certain expenses, the scope of such items is interpreted very narrowly, and the bulk of operating costs and general administrative costs are not permitted to be deducted. While there are currently several pending cases before various administrative and federal courts challenging these restrictions, there is no guarantee that these courts will issue an interpretation of Section 280E that is favorable to cannabis businesses. Several states have passed legislation decoupling from Section 280E, including California, Massachusetts, and Michigan.
Limited Trademark Protection
We will not be able to register any U.S. federal trademarks in classes covering their cannabis-related products or services under the current state of federal law. Because producing, manufacturing, processing, possessing, distributing, and selling cannabis is illegal under the CSA, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) will not permit the registration of any trademark that does not comply with the CSA. As a result, the Company will unlikely be able to protect its cannabis product trademarks beyond the geographic areas in which its subsidiaries conduct business pursuant to the relevant state’s law.
21


Civil Asset Forfeiture
Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, any real or personal property owned by participants in the cannabis industry, such as the Company, which is used in the course of conducting such business, or any property or monies deemed to be proceeds of an illegal cannabis business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture, even in the absence of a criminal charge or conviction.
FDA Regulation
Cannabis containing more than 0.3% THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) remains a Schedule I controlled substance under U.S. federal law. If the federal government reclassifies cannabis to a Schedule II controlled substance, it is possible that the FDA would regulate it under the FD&C Act, or under the Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA may issue rules, regulations or guidance including good manufacturing practices, related to the growth, cultivation, harvesting and processing of medical cannabis. If regulated by the FDA as a drug, clinical trials would be needed to demonstrate efficacy and safety. It is also possible that the FDA would require that facilities where medical-use cannabis is grown register with the FDA and comply with certain federally prescribed regulations.
In addition, while the FDA has not yet pursued enforcement actions against the cannabis industry, it has sent numerous warning letters to sellers of CBD products making health claims. The FDA could turn its attention to the cannabis industry especially relating to claims of concern. In the event that some or all of these regulations or enforcement actions are imposed, what the impact this would have on the cannabis industry is unknown, including what costs, requirements and possible prohibitions may be enforced.
Laws and Regulations Affecting the Industry in which the Company Operates are Constantly Changing
The constant evolution of laws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry could detrimentally affect the Company. The current and proposed operations of the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a variety of local, state and federal medical cannabis laws and regulations relating to the manufacture, management, transportation, storage and disposal of cannabis, as well as laws and regulations relating to consumable products health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require the Company to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter certain aspects of their business plans. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt certain aspects of the business plans of the Company and result in a material adverse effect on certain aspects of their planned operations. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and subject to change with minimal notice. Regulatory changes may adversely affect the Company's profitability or cause it to cease operations entirely. The cannabis industry may come under scrutiny or further scrutiny by, the FDA, USDA, DEA, IRS, SEC, the DOJ, the Financial Industry Regulatory Advisory or other federal or applicable state or nongovernmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise or regulate the production, distribution, sale or use of cannabis for medical or adult use purposes in the United States. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any proposals will become law. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the industry may adversely affect the business and operations of the Company, including without limitation, the costs to remain compliant with applicable laws and the impairment of its business or the ability to raise additional capital. In addition, the Company will not be able to predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to its business. For example, see the “Risk Factors - Heightened Scrutiny by Canadian Authorities” related to CDS above.
22


Limitation on Ownership of Licenses
In certain states, the cannabis laws and regulations limit not only the number of cannabis licenses issued, but also the number of cannabis licenses that one person or entity may own. For example, in Massachusetts, no person may have an ownership interest, or control over, more than three license holders in any category - cultivation, processing or dispensing. The Company believes that, where such restrictions apply, it may still capture significant share of revenue in the market through wholesale sales, exclusive marketing relations, provision of management or consulting services, franchising and similar arrangement with other operators. Nevertheless, such limitations on the acquisition of ownership of additional licenses within certain states may limit the Company’s ability to grow organically or to increase its market share in such states.
COMPLIANCE
Under the direction of the Company’s internal compliance team and outside legal counsel, the Company oversees, maintains, and implements a compliance program in conjunction with its operations in each jurisdiction. In addition, the Company has local regulatory/compliance counsel engaged in every jurisdiction (state and local) in which it operates. The Company, together with onsite management in each jurisdiction, is responsible for ensuring operations and that employees strictly comply with applicable laws, regulations, and licensing conditions and ensure that operations do not endanger the health, safety or welfare of the community. The Company designates a duly qualified and experienced manager at each location who is responsible to coordinate with operational units within each facility (to extent applicable) to ensure that the operation and all employees are following and complying with the Company’s written security procedures and all regulatory compliance standards. 
In conjunction with the Company’s human resources and operations departments, the compliance and quality control departments help oversee and implement training for all employees, including on compliance with state and local laws, compliance with state and local laws, cultivation/manufacturing/dispensing/transport procedures (as applicable), security and safety policies and procedures, inventory control, T&T, seed-to-sale, and point of sale systems training (as applicable); and quality control.
The Company’s compliance program emphasizes security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis (including living plants and harvested plant material) and cannabis product inventory. Only authorized, properly trained employees in accordance with local and state regulations are allowed to access the Company’s inventory management systems.
The Company and local outside counsel, monitor all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market, timely resolving any issues identified. The team maintains records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors and how and when the issue was resolved. The Company has created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory, as well as procedures for performing inventory reconciliation and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. The Company maintains accurate records of its inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to the Company’s standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that the Company’s operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. Training on these standard operating procedures is mandatory by all employees and defined by function and role.
23


The Company has developed and continues to refine a robust compliance program designed to ensure operational and regulatory requirements continue to be satisfied and has worked closely with experts and outside counsel to develop compliance procedures intended to assist the Company in monitoring compliance with U.S. state law on an ongoing basis. The Company will continue to work closely with outside counsel and other compliance experts to further develop, enhance and improve its compliance and risk management and mitigation processes and procedures in furtherance of continued compliance with the complex regulatory frameworks of the states where the Company operates. The internal compliance program currently in place includes continued monitoring by the Company’s management team, outside counsel, and the Company’s subsidiaries to ensure that all operations conform to and comply with required laws, rules, regulations and standard operating procedures. The Company further requires its operating subsidiaries to report and disclose all instances of non-compliance, regulatory, administrative, or legal proceedings that may be initiated against them to the appropriate point of contact as set forth in the Company’s standard operating procedures.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time, as with all businesses and all rules, it is anticipated that the Company, through its subsidiaries and establishments to which the Company provides operational support, may experience incidences of non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations, which may include minor matters such as:
•improper illumination of external signage;
•missing fields entries in a visitor log;
•total or partial obstruction of camera views;
•supplemental use of onsite surveillance room (i.e., storage);
•minor inventory discrepancies with regulatory reporting software;
•uptime issues regarding regulatory reporting software;
•missing fields in regulatory reports;
•cleaning schedules not available on display;
•inability to strictly adhere to curbside purchase protocols as written;
•updated staffing plan not immediately available on site; and
•marijuana infused product utensils improperly stored.
In addition, either on an inspection basis or in response to complaints, such as from neighbors, customers or former employees, State or local regulators may, among other things, issue investigatory- or demand-type letters, give warnings to or cite businesses which the Company operates or for which the Company provides operational support for violations, including those listed above. Such regulatory actions could lead to a requirement or directive to submit and thereafter comply with (for example) a plan of correction. Depending on the jurisdiction, it is also possible regulators may assess penalties and/or amendments, suspensions or revocations of licenses or otherwise take action that may impact the Company’s licenses, business activities, operational support activities or operations.
24


To address such potential notices of non-compliance, the Company has implemented ongoing compliance reviews to ensure its subsidiaries and establishments to which it provides operational support are operating in conformance with applicable State and local cannabis rules and regulations. In the event non-compliance is discovered, during a compliance review or via internal audit, the Company will promptly remedy the same, including by self-reporting to applicable State and local cannabis regulators as and when required by law and will make all requisite and appropriate public disclosures of non-compliance, citations, notices of violation and the like which may have an impact on its licenses, business activities, operational support activities or operations.
The Company is in compliance with the laws of each of the states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington and California and the related cannabis licensing framework. Other than as disclosed in this 10-K, there are no current incidences of non-compliance, citations or notices of violation outstanding which may have an impact on the Company’s licenses, business activities or operations in these states. Notwithstanding the foregoing, like all businesses the Company may from time to time experience incidences of non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations in the states in which the Company operates and such non-compliance may have an impact on the Company’s licenses, business activities or operations in the applicable state. However, the Company takes steps to minimize, disclose and remedy all incidences of non-compliance which may have an impact on the Company’s activities or operations in all states in which the Company operates. 
Strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company.
Industry Overview
The legal marijuana industry is comprised of several sub-sectors and is legal under different guidelines in many U.S. states though it remains illegal federally in the U.S. Notwithstanding, the overall sector is generally recognized to be one of the fastest growing in the U.S. Independent projections and publicized reports from sources such as Headset.io, expect total annual cannabis revenue of US$45.8 billion by 2025, both as the sector gains in credibility and acceptance, and as more and more states legalize either medical use or adult recreational use; or both. As of the date hereof, 39 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories have authorized cannabis for medical use. In addition, 21 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S territories have authorized cannabis for adult use.
Product Research and Development
Our branded products portfolio includes stock keeping units (“SKUs”) across a range of product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, capsules, tinctures, edibles, topicals and other cannabis-related products. Furthermore, we engage in research and development activities focused on developing new extracted or infused cannabis consumer packaged products with a focus on providing consumers with a wide array of high-quality, low-cost products.
Customers and Revenue
Customers of our consumer packaged goods business include legal state-licensed cannabis dispensaries within each U.S. state in which we operate, as well as national retail channels, including department stores and specialty boutiques. The majority of our branded consumer packaged goods are distributed to our vertically integrated retail locations with the remainder distributed to unrelated, third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. We also sell bulk product at wholesale, toll process for third parties, and do white label production. We are not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would not have a material adverse effect on the business. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal 2022 or 2021.
25


Sales, Marketing and Brand Development
The Company employs full-time, in-house marketing, retail, and brand development functions. These functions engage in a range of brand-building activities and strategies, including market research, consumer insights research, new brand development, product innovation, copy & content production, design, packaging, retail operations and sales, to support business performance and growth at the local and national levels.
The Company's branded products, which are developed, acquired and licensed, are sold in five states, with plans to significantly increase distribution and expand form factors in 2023. The Company’s portfolio of product brands includes the following:
• Edibles: Chewee’s, Ka’Kau, KOKO Gemz, Hi-Burst, Left-Handed Brand, Mari’s Mints, Marmas, Pebbles, Verdure
•Wellness and Pain Relief: Pure Ratios (CBD), Verdure
•Concentrates: Crystal Clear, Terp Stix, Golden Goo, Evergreen, EZ Vape, Melo Premium Vape
•Flower: Private Reserve, Legends, Mini Budz, Island
Competition
The cannabis industry is highly competitive. We compete on quality, price, brand recognition, and distribution strength. Our cannabis products compete with other products for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail dispensaries and wholesaler attention. We compete with thousands of cannabis producing companies from small “mom and pop” operations to multi-billion-dollar market cap multi-state operators. Our principal multi-state operator competitors include but are not limited to Curaleaf Holdings, Inc., Green Thumb Industries Inc., Cresco Labs Inc, Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc., and MariMed, Inc.
Sources and Availability of Production Materials
The principal components in the production of our cannabis consumer packaged goods include cannabis grown internally or acquired through wholesale channels, other agricultural products, and packaging materials (including glass, plastic and cardboard). Due to the U.S. federal prohibition on cannabis, we must source cannabis within each individual state in which it is to be sold. While there are opportunities for centralized sourcing of some packaging materials, given each state’s unique regulatory requirements, multi-state operators do not currently have access to nationwide packaging solutions.
Seasonality
In certain regions, especially on the West Coast, the cannabis industry can be subject to seasonality in some states that allow home grows. Because homegrown plants are typically harvested in the late summer or early fall, there can be some deceleration in retail and wholesale sales trends during these months as these private supplies are consumed.
26


Intellectual Property
We protect our brands and trademarks to the extent permissible under applicable law. We hold certain state registered and unregistered trademarks in association with its cannabis goods listed below:
•Edibles: Chewee’s, KOKO Gemz, Hi-Burst, Left-Handed, Mari’s Mints, Marmas, Pebbles
•Wellness and Pain Relief: Pure Ratios
•Concentrates: Crystal Clear, Golden Goo, Evergreen, EZ Vape, Terp Stix
•Flower: Mini Budz, Funky Monkey, Legends, Island, 1988
•Other: Lotionz, Magic Kitchen, Potionz, THCaps, Verdure

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, unlike public companies that are not emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act, we will not be required to:
•provide an auditor’s attestation report on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes Oxley Act”);
•provide more than two years of audited financial statements and related management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations;
•comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer;
•provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies or hold stockholder advisory votes on the executive compensation required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”); or
•obtain stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of the:
•last day of the fiscal year in which we have $1.07 billion or more in total annual gross revenues;
•date on which we become a “large accelerated filer” (the fiscal year-end on which the total market value of our common equity securities held by non-affiliates is $700,000 or more as of June 30);
•date on which we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period; or
•last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering.
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this report, and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.
