We provide comprehensive information technology (IT) as a service offerings (ITaaS), including cybersecurity, cloud services, network operations, and professional services. We provide a complete outsourcing solution that includes hardware, software, network and associated management for our clients’ IT needs. Additionally, we provide development operations support, artificial intelligence implementation, and the Microsoft stack of technologies to help our customers to be productive, agile, and efficient in a secure environment. provide the above solutions from the cloud that ensures scalability, resiliency, and security. We also provide “migration to the cloud” services that enables our customers to take advantage of cost savings through economies of scale and elimination of redundancy as well as taking advantage of built in scalability and resiliency of the cloud.

Sales Cycle 

We sell service solutions to government and business enterprises. Our ability to successfully sell our services depends upon the relationships we build and maintain relationships with key decisions makers at existing customers and prospective customer organizations. Our sales cycle is long and is often affected by many factors outside of our control including but not limited to customer specific proposal and acquisition processes, unique customer service requirements, the customer’s timetable and urgency, changes in key leadership and/or personnel that slows down the proposal or project, an evaluation by different functional groups within the prospective customers organization before a purchase decision is made by the organization, budgetary funding delays, intermittent U.S. federal government shutdowns, competitive bidding processes and other policy constraints, as well as additional factors that may lengthen the sales cycle. Many of these variables are outside our control and we attempt to manage the financial impact on us by building a large pipeline with opportunities that have overlapping sales cycles.

It could take more than 12 months to enter into a contract with a customer from the time we first actively engage a prospective customer and then a full implementation could range from mere weeks to several months depending on the complexity of the customers statement of work and level of engagement by us and the customer to get the deployment completed. Contract closing and implementation timelines vary as a result of these factors, many of which are outside our control.

Sales Approaches

We approach selling our services under either a direct sales model under which we control the contract and key relationships or we partner with a large systems integrator and other strategic partners to provide our TMaaS solution as part of their overall total solution offering to the end customer. We have historically grown our business under the direct sales model; however, more recently we have closed a significant portion of our new sales through our partnerships with large systems integrators. While we believe we can continue to be successful growing our sales through both models, larger scale opportunities tend to require partnerships with large entrenched systems integrators and other strategic partners.

Our sales approaches are summarized below:

Systems Integrators. We partner with large systems integrators to collectively pursue large market opportunities that include our some or all of our TMaaS solution within the scope of the solicitations. In these types of arrangements, we generally operate as a subcontractor and manage the customer relationship closely with the prime contractor. We do not utilize any channel partners or third-party firms in this sales approach.
Strategic Partnerships. We partner with vendors who are leaders in their industries such as Healthcare, Telecommunication, Transportation, etc. to leverage their channels or reseller networks to sell our TMaaS solution. This approach allows us to sell into markets that would be otherwise be costly and difficult to reach. By leveraging these partners’ existing customer relationships, we can shorten the sale cycle and have a higher success rate
Internal Sales Force. We have a team of sales professionals account managers and project managers that are responsible for identifying and pursuing commercial and government opportunities for our TMaaS offerings. We take a team approach for engaging with a potential customer. Our sales teams consists of sales lead, account managers, solution experts and other subject matter experts to assist with execution of product demonstrations, proposal creation and submission, contract negotiation, relationship management, sales closing and final transition of closed deals to the operations team. Sales commissions are calculated and paid based on net collected gross managed service revenues times a fixed commission rate that declines over the base term of the contract. There are no commissions paid after the base term expires. We plan to add resources for this effort to help manage our system integrator and strategic partnership efforts as well as increasing the number of qualified leads in our sales pipeline to further spur growth.
Upselling and Cross Selling. After a customer is on boarded, we focus on delivering our service promise and then upsell and cross sell our TMaaS solution offerings. We may enter into preferred supplier network programs agreements with our customers and offer our TMaaS solutions on similar terms and conditions to their suppliers and customer which in turn could increase our potential sales opportunities. We also directly ask our customers for referrals into their professional network, customer and supplier groups to drive additional sales opportunities.
Indirect Sales Approach. We may use an indirect sales approach to reach new target markets by outsourcing our lead generation and certain business development activities through a third-party channel partner. We do not use this sales approach very often due to the high cost of commissions charged by these channel partners as their commission terms often span the entire life of the customer relationship which may not be financially viable to the customer or us. We do not anticipate using this sales approach extensively to drive sales opportunities.

Our sales team has a wide variety of skills and expertise to cultivate qualified leads and guide our prospective customers towards finding a solution that meets their organization’s goals and objectives.

Marketing and Branding

Our marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our solutions in our target markets that will allow us to successfully build strong relationships with key decision markers involved in the sales process on the customer side. Key decisions makers typically consist of information technology executives, finance executives and managers of communications assets and networks.

We engage in a wide variety of broad-based and targeted marketing campaigns designed to broaden market awareness of our solutions and expertise. Broad-based marketing campaigns include attending and speaking at industry and tradeshows, website marketing, publishing technical whitepapers and use case studies, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns, subject matter expert forums and industry visibility initiatives. Targeted marketing campaigns including internet search engine optimization, directed e-mail and direct mail, co-marketing strategies designed to leverage existing customer and network relationships.

Customer Concentrations 

We derive a significant amount of our revenues from contracts funded by federal government agencies for which we act in capacity as the prime contractor, or as a subcontractor. We believe that contracts with federal government agencies in particular, will be the primary source of our revenues for the foreseeable future although we are working to increase our footprint with commercial customers through our relationships with large systems integrators and strategic partners. Accordingly, negative changes in federal government fiscal or spending policies (including continuing budget resolutions and government shutdowns) that impact the spending budgets of our key government customers, including Department of Homeland Security, will directly affect our financial performance.

We expect all of our customers to be motivated to meet their organizational needs for mobile management, IT management, and security objectives in this challenging environment. As a result of delivering our TMaaS service solution we can often save our customers a significant portion of their total spend on mobility and security management which translates into real cash savings. While most of our customers use their savings to purchase and upgrade their managed services, our customers could potentially negatively impact our billable revenue base and result in lower profit margins if they decide to retain the savings and not purchase additional higher margin services. We believe we have an attractive set of solutions and we also believe that government spending for mobility management and for cybersecurity services and solutions will increase for the foreseeable future.

Our government customer base is located predominantly in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. while our commercial customer base is located throughout the continental U.S., Canada, Europe and the Middle East. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from federal government contracts in the United States.

Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the size and number of customer contracts both in public and private sectors.

Government Contracts 

We have numerous government contracts and contract vehicles. Our contracts with the federal government, and many contracts with other entities, permit the government customer to modify, curtail or terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government, or for default by the contractor. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we are generally reimbursed for our allowable costs through the date of termination and are paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work actually performed.

7


Contract vehicles include Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (“GWACs”), and Blanket Purchase Agreements (“BPAs”) based upon GSA Schedule 70, and customer specific contracts. We also hold a number of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (“ID/IQ”) contracts, including, but not limited to:


· | Department of Homeland Security for Cellular Wireless Managed Services (CWMS) 2.0 Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract (DHS CWMS 2.0 IDIQ).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Subsidiaries of WidePoint are approved subcontractors for the following ID/IQ contracts: 


o | NASA End-User Services and Technologies (NEST) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
o | GSA Alliant 2 
o | GSA Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS) 
o | GSA Connections II 
o | National Institutes of Health Chief Information Officer Solutions and Partners (CIO-SP3)
o | NASA Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) 
o | Department of Justice (DOJ) Enterprise Standard Architecture V (ESA V) 


We will continue to build on our partnerships with key systems integrators and strategic partners to compete for public and private sector opportunities.

Product Development and Technology Solution Enhancements

We believe that our existing technology platforms are adequate and meet our operational obligations to our customers. We may fund certain product development initiatives to enhance or customize existing client facing platforms and software solutions. These initiatives are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our software solutions and meeting our customer’s changing organizational requirements, as necessary. We determine which enhancements to further develop after assessing the market capabilities sought by potential customers, considering technological advances, feedback on enhancements from our current customer user groups and other factors. Our current development activities are focused on the integration of our heterogeneous services delivery platforms, and improving the security posture and delivery of our information technology services.

We utilize a standard architecture to ensure enhancements are subject to appropriate oversight and scrutiny and follow a consistent and efficient process. Our development team is comprised of professionals with hands-on technical and practical customer-side development experience. We believe this allows us to design and deploy enhancements that can resolve real-world problems in a timely manner.

We funded and expensed strategic product development initiatives as well as platform and portal integrations and other product and portal enhancements during the year. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred product development costs associated with our next generation TMaaS platform application, Secure Identity Management Solutions, Unified Communications Analytics (UCAS) solution, and data center of approximately $3.2 million and $2.6 million, respectively, which were capitalized. In 2023, we will continue to work with our strategic partners to continue and focus our product development efforts as well as with customer integrations.

Security Certification and Accreditation

Our TMaaS solution framework has received multiple security certifications and accreditations from the federal government. As a result we have multiple authorizations to operate (ATOs) from the Department of Homeland Security, the General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Commerce. The ATOs attest to the fact that we meet all of the cybersecurity requirements for processing sensitive data as ascribed by the Federal Information Management Act at the Moderate and High levels. These ATOs are difficult, time consuming, and costly to attain. Our security certification and accreditation represents a significant reduction of security risk for our customers both in public and private sectors.
Data Centers

We host our proprietary solutions and operate all servers, systems and networks multiple data centers located in North America and Europe, which we may consolidate in the future. We also host our proprietary solutions in the cloud and have plans to migrate more customers to the cloud in the future. Our agreements with our customers contain guarantees regarding specified levels of system availability, and we regularly provide our customers with performance reports against those standards. We utilize monitoring technology software tools that continuously checks our servers and key underlying components at regular intervals for issues with system availability and performance, server and application security and penetration vulnerabilities, and other factors that may impact the availability of our systems to our customers. Each data center provides security measures, redundant environmental controls, fire suppression systems and redundant electrical generators to meet our service level agreements. To facilitate data loss recovery, we operate a multi-tiered system configuration with load-balanced web server tools, replicated database servers and fault-tolerant storage devices. The architecture is designed to ensure near real-time data recovery in the event of a malfunction of a primary server. Based on customer requirements, we can also provide near real-time asynchronous data replication between operational and disaster recovery backup sites.
Intellectual Property 

Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary service as a solution, technology, operational processes and other intellectual property. We protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology or otherwise develop software or services with the same functionality as our software and services.

U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.

Market Competition 

Our TMaaS market is centered on mobile management, identity management, ITaaS and digital billing and analytics.

Target Markets. Our target market is highly fragmented and we compete with small and large companies that offer different components of TMaaS. We believe that we are presently the only provider of all four of these critical services offerings. We believe that our TMaaS solution offering gives us a strong competitive advantage over our competitors due to our distinctive technical competencies, long-standing client relationships, successful past contract performance with large commercial and government organizations, governmental certifications and authorizations to operate (ATOs) within this space, price and value of services delivered, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with subject matter expertise.
Market Pricing. Pricing for services in our market lacks transparency due to the way in which our competitors price their services. Our competitors take advantage of this lack of pricing transparency and prospective customer’s lack of understanding and awareness of market pricing for services. Our competitors often take advantage of a prospective customer and will often heavily discount their prices to unprofitable levels thereby creating a commodity pricing environment that affects the value of the solution perceived by prospective customers, severely limits profitability for other service providers that provide better solutions, discourages further innovation and harms the customer in the end. The costs to switch solutions can be high for a prospective customer even if they know their current solution is not working.

Our prices for services are transparent and we attempt to match our customers need with the right level of services for a single inclusive fee whenever practical. We practice transparent pricing strategies that allow our customers to purchase our entire full-service solution or select only the services they require to meet their needs. We do not use introductory teaser rates to attract new customers or conduct bait and switch pricing tactics with our customers as is often practiced by our competitors. Pricing for our TMaaS offering will vary depending on our prospective customer’s technology infrastructure, scale of their operations, workflow requirements and many other factors that can affect pricing.

We do not view our services as a commodity, and comparability of our TMaaS offering against other competitors’ service offerings is not practical due to differences in pricing models described above and overall capabilities among competitors. As a result of this pricing differences between us and our competitors it can be difficult to compare to pricing models in our market.

All prospective customers tend to initially have price sensitivity and that often changes after we are able to demonstrate that our solutions are superior and will save them time and money. We believe our TMaaS solution pricing is competitive and reflects the value of the solutions provided to our customers. Our goal is providing the best solution for our customers that meets their needs.

Competition. Our TMaaS solution crosses into several different market segments and as a result we do not have competitors that compete in all of the market segments in which we conduct business. Some of our principal competitors include: MDSL/Calero, Tangoe, Inc., Brightfin, DMI, A&T Systems, and Turning Point Global Services, LLC; Identity Management – Entrust Corp., IdenTrust and XTec Inc.; Digital Billing & Analytics – Amdocs Britebill and Globys Inc.; ITaaS - BMC Software, HPE, StratCore; Next Level Technologies, and many others.

Our larger competitors often have more size and financial resources than us and they may be able to provide a wider array of technology solutions outside of our core capabilities. Due to our significant federal government contract concentrations, we also experience competition from a variety of both large and small companies, including divisions of large federal government integrators such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and other large and mid-sized federal contractors, as well as a limited number of small to mid-sized subject matter expert organizations offering specialized capabilities within the identity management space.


10


If we are unable to keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace, deliver cost-effective and relevant solutions to our target market, our business, financial condition and results of operations will suffer.

Contracting 

We prefer to serve as the prime contractor when we win contract awards; however, we will often serve as a subcontractor and partner with a large systems integrator to win a larger market opportunity. We also may enter into strategic teaming agreements with another competitor or a vertical supplier to capture a market opportunity. Prospective customers in our target market use a wide array of contract vehicles to purchase technology services ranging from individual purchase orders, awards or consolidated service contracts (including blanket purchase agreements and similar indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contracts) that cover a range of technology services, of which we may or may not be able to provide all of the services to serve as the prime contractor.
Seasonality 

Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the number of billable days in a quarter, the timing of the carrier services revenues and other direct costs, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of the government agencies for awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a significant portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter. Additionally, because we derive a large percentage of our revenue from the U.S. Federal Government, their budgeting process also affects the purchasing patterns of our the agency customers that will significantly impact the quarter to quarter financial performance
Regulation

Our most significant source of regulation relates to compliance with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. government contracts, including:


· | the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and agency regulations analogous or supplemental to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act (formerly known as Truth in Negotiations Act), which requires certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with some contract negotiations; 
· | the Procurement Integrity Act; 
· | the Cost Accounting Standards, which impose cost accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under some cost-based government contracts; and 
· | laws, regulations, and executive orders restricting (i) the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes, (ii) the exportation of specified solutions, technologies and technical data, and (iii) the use and dissemination of sensitive but unclassified data;
· | the General Data Protection Regulation is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also regulates the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas 


The federal government audits and reviews our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. If a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with U.S. government agencies.

Human Capital

As of December 31, 2022, WidePoint employed 215 full time employees (183 in United States and 32 in Europe), 5 consultants, 3 part-time staff, and 15 subcontractors.

We consider our human capital to be one of the most important strategic assets or our company. As such, we seek to foster and maintain a safe, professional, and harassment free work environment. Each employee is required to conduct himself or herself as required by WidePoint’s business code of conduct and ethics policy contained in the WidePoint Employee Handbook. Our core values are:
People. Attract, develop, and retain the best and the brightest talent for our business and strongly encourage intellectual curiosity to learn new ways to efficiently and effectively deliver our services. Value diversity of our people, foster an open and inclusive environment and treat each person in a manner that reflects our values.
Service. Deliver long-term customer satisfaction in all our TMaaS service offerings in a manner that enables WidePoint to meet or exceed established financial targets that will ultimately deliver greater shareholder value.
Integrity. Act with the highest integrity and ethics and inspire trust from our customers, employees, vendors, and other stakeholders by matching our behaviors to our words and taking responsibility for our actions.

We expect every WidePoint employee to adhere to these core values when dealing with colleagues, customers, suppliers, and any other potential stakeholder of WidePoint.

WidePoint provides a compensation package that is competitive within our industry such that we will attract, retain, motivate and reward superior employees who must operate in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment. We seek to link annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align the employee’s financial interests with the interests of shareholders. Our compensation package also include a broad range of benefits such as healthcare insurance, career training and education tuition reimbursement, 401K retirement plan, annual paid time off, and many others.

We recognize the benefits of building a corporate culture that promotes diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) and build teams that focus on:


· | cultivating an environment that encourages collaboration, flexibility and fairness to enable all employees to contribute to their full potential;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | promoting diversity in our talent management and succession planning processes and employee development programs; and 
· | ensuring leadership commitment in facilitating the Company’s DEI efforts 


We believe the combination of competitive compensation package and career growth and development opportunities have helped increase employee tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. As of December 31, 2022, the average tenure of our employees was approximately seven (7) years and more than one fourth of our employees have been employed by us for more than ten (10) years.
