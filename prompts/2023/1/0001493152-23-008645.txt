Business
 
We are an early-stage diversified holdings company which sells multiple products under common management with one of them a global multi-line consumer packaged goods (“CPG”) company with branded product lines in the food and snack industry. This division operates as marketer and distributor in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Another division is focused and involved in building and acquiring ecommerce assets as well as private businesses in various verticals with the goal of scaling them up and increasing revenue. Historically, the large majority of our sales have been through traditional brick-and-mortar methods. However, going forward, we intend to focus on growing our e-commerce business as well as maintaining the core business which in large part exists in brick and mortar.

Packaged Goods
 
The Company is focused on developing and marketing products that appeal to consumers’ growing preference in the snack foods category. The Company is taking a major shift towards ecommerce development and acquisition of new ecommerce assets to diversify its business with an approximate 90/10 focus on ecommerce sales while still growing brick and mortar sales. As the Company identifies products that fit within its distribution channels, it will seek to enter into non-exclusive manufacturing and licensing agreements with such factories to manufacture products under the Company’s own trademarked brands for sale in the United States and/or global markets. Currently, the Company maintains six trademarks for its brands registered with the US Patent and Trademark Office. Each trademark covers numerous product lines with a variety of unique identifiers (known as SKUs) offered under the applicable brand name. The Company has non-contractual on-going relationships with a few Fortune 500 companies, including club and retail chain stores to whom the Company directly sells its products.
 
The Company sells its food and snack products directly in the United States and global markets through various distribution channels comprising specialty, grocery retailers, food-service distributors and direct store delivery (“DSD”), as well as the vending, pantry, and the micro-market segment. Our buyers typically represent recognized large retail chain stores. The products are then distributed by the chains to their local outlets. The Company seeks out and develops snacks and gourmet foods to brand under its trademarks based on market trends and input from the buyers as to consumer demand. The Company works closely with buyers to evaluate products with the intent to identify products that have likely customer demand. We recently re-branded and launched all new snack marketplace and will seek to gain market share in the ecommerce segment. Our re-branded website will serve as snack marketplace which will carry its own branded products and other gourmet snacks and products.
 
We intend to develop additional gourmet foods and snack products under its trademarked brands and to expand the Company’s offering portfolio by identifying, producing, and marketing new products. Management believes that the strategy of acquiring small brands regional brands and adding these to the Company’s national distribution can prove beneficial for the Company.
 
The Company’s management believes that the strategy of acquiring small brands regional distribution brands and acquiring more e-commerce brand assets will diversify its current business and increase its business operation results.
 
Vending Operations
 
In addition to placing its products with large retail specialty chains, the Company supplies products to vending channels throughout the United States through food service distributors. These vending machines are located in malls, service stations, and schools. The Company works with vending companies that have, in the aggregate, more than 100,000 machines nationwide. The Company supplies vending companies with products. The Company works directly with some vending companies and with others through its food service distributors. The broker pre-sells the products and the distributor services the accounts. When the distributor services the accounts, the distributor buys the product directly. Vending machine sales represent approximately one percent our revenues.
 
E-Commerce Business
 
On August 31, 2022, the Company acquired from InPlay all of the assets relating to the online home fitness store known as “The Hula Fit,” including the Shopify Store and the TikTok, Facebook and Google ad accounts. The Company intends to make additional acquisitions of ecommerce businesses and assets in an attempt to grow its digital business.

Products and Trademarked Brands
 
The Company currently owns six trademark brands. Each brand encompasses numerous SKUs that are brought to the market from time to time.

Retail Chain Buyers
 
The primary distribution of our products has been through specialty retail chains. We work with the buying office that determines placement for our products. The retail chain will then distribute the products to its retail outlets.
Our Strategy and Strengths
 
We believe a variety of favorable consumer trends, including a greater focus on health and wellness, increased consumption of smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day and a preference for convenient gourmet foods and snacks will continue to drive overall snacking growth within the overall market. Our Management believes that the Company’s products appeal to a wide range of consumers, including most age brackets. The young snackers, classified as those being between the ages of 18-34, tend to consume more snacks than average adults but the gourmet foods reach the broader adult market. The senior market tends to reduce snacks and gourmet foods. We expect to explore the development and acquisition of small regional brands and add them to the Company’s national distribution within the United States and globally.
 
We anticipate that our marketing strategy will use the internet and social media including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Our distribution channels consist of retailers, distributors, online e-commerce, and vending companies. The Company’s marketing strategy is primarily targeted at vendors and retail chain stores.
 
The Company anticipates utilizing the following opportunities to further its marketing program, to obtain information to adjust and modify, as needed, the marketing program, and to create direct interest in its products:
 
Networking. Networking could be a low-cost but often effective means for us to generate partnerships and growth while bolstering personal commitments to the Company. Management will join wholesalers’ associations to network with other food manufacturers and distributors.
 
Trade Shows. The Company plans to attend trade shows and exhibitions related to the food manufacturing industry, such as SIAL, PLMA Amsterdam, Thaifex, Fancy Food, CIBUS, ISM, and ANUGA among others. Through attendance at conventions and trade shows, management remains knowledgeable and informed about advancements, trends, and issues of concern in the market.
 
Direct Sales. The Company plans to employ a dedicated sales team to enact precise sales and promotional efforts in the near future.

Social Media and Food Blogging. The Company will manage its brands on social media sites, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Twitter has proven an effective platform to conduct customer satisfaction surveys as well as solicit customer feedback on food products.
 
The rise in popularity of the food blogging community has given consumers a massive platform on which to share their opinion and make their voices heard. This has led to a rise in consumer concerns about food, with increasing emphasis being placed on healthy eating and organic produce. The Company will use food blogging websites to promote its products and highlight benefits that appeal to a new generation of socially-aware consumers.
 
Websites. A well-optimized website has been constructed, with proper site structure, page layout, and clear and easy navigation, along with targeted keywords embedded throughout the site to ensure prominent search engine placement and saturation. The Company’s websites are important marketing assets:
 
www.360worldsnacks.com,
 www.biscottelli.com,
 www.gdmginc.com,
 www.dolcibono.com,
 www.fruttatasnacks.com, 
 www.ezlyv.com 
 
We anticipate that we will primarily target teens and adults up to age 65. The primary target market is “Young Snackers” that are 18-34 years old and tend to eat more snacks than other age groups. The trend of snacks between meals is especially strong with millennials and younger Americans. A quarter of American millennials, age 23 to 40, reported eating four or more times a day, compared to just 10% of Gen X and 9% of Baby Boomers. The Company believes that the senior age bracket (over 65) is not a strong snack market.
 
The Company use of co-packers for manufacturing and packaging of its products provides the most efficient and cost-effective means of operations for a small company like we are. It allows us to scale-up and meet growing demand, without having to invest in our own industrial setting and without the high overhead costs of hiring salespeople as employees of the Company. The Company intends to employ this model strategy in the future and also to attract and retain experienced sales team.
 
Competition
 
The snack food industry in the United States is very competitive, particularly in the savory and salty snack segment. In the United States, a study conducted and published by the Packaging Strategies magazine reported that snacks account for 51% of all food sales, and 92% of adults in the US have snacked within the last 24 hours.
 
The Company has observed an increased demand for “healthy” snacks. In the United States, companies are finding success in the “snackable” fruit and vegetable category, such as grapes or baby carrots.
 
A challenge facing entrants in the snack and gourmet food market is the dominance of leading snack food producers, particularly the industry leader PepsiCo. Large producers may experience a high degree of brand and consumer loyalty and typically possess sufficient capital to invest in extensive advertising and promotions to obtain a greater market share. Furthermore, companies such as PepsiCo often benefit from higher profit margins when compared with small- to medium-sized operators, enabling them to lower their product prices and to engage in price-based competition with competitors. Multinational producers may also experience lower per-unit costs due to economies of scale and scope
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has four employees, including one executive officer, a director of operations, a warehouse manager and a staff employee.
 
Subsidiaries
 
Global Diversified Holdings, Inc., is the Company’s only subsidiary.
