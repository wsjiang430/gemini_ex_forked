ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Rare Element was incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada on June 3, 1999 as Spartacus Capital Inc. We are currently governed under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “BCBCA”). Our executive office address is P.O. Box 271049, Littleton, Colorado 80127. The telephone number for our executive office is (720) 278-2460. We maintain a corporate website at www.rareelementresources.com.
Originally organized as a “capital pool” company whose activities were focused on the identification and completion of a qualifying transaction as required by the rules of the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”), we transitioned to a “venture company” on July 25, 2003, coincident with (1) the completion of a reverse takeover acquisition of Rare Element Holdings Ltd. (the qualifying transaction), (2) a name change of “Spartacus Capital Inc.” to Rare Element Resources Ltd., and (3) the completion of a private placement. The Company’s main assets include its proprietary rare earth processing and/or beneficiation and separation technology and its 100% interest in a group of unpatented mining claims and repurchase rights to adjacent private property, together known as the Bear Lodge Property, owned through a wholly owned subsidiary, Rare Element Resources, Inc., a Wyoming corporation.
SUBSIDIARIES
We have one direct wholly owned subsidiary, incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada in 1996 under the name Rare Element Holdings Ltd. That subsidiary has one direct wholly owned subsidiary, Rare Element Resources, Inc., incorporated in 1997 in the state of Wyoming, USA, formerly known as Paso Rico (USA), Inc. (“Paso Rico”).
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
We are focused on demonstrating the technical and economic feasibility of our proprietary recovery and separation technology through the permitting and licensing, construction, and operation of a planned Demonstration Plant and advancing the Bear Lodge REE Project located near the town of Sundance in northeast Wyoming. The Bear Lodge REE Project consists of several large, disseminated REE deposits and a planned hydrometallurgical plant to be located near Upton, Wyoming. The Bear Lodge REE Project is one of the highest-grade REE deposits identified in North America containing a favorable distribution of CREE.
In its development efforts for the Bear Lodge REE Project, the Company has done extensive laboratory bench-scale and pilot plant testing on metallurgical processes to recover saleable rare earth products and has been granted two patents on its metallurgical processing innovations. Among them, the Company has pilot tested and received patent protection on a rare earth separation technique that modifies conventional solvent extraction methods for rare earth separation expected to be more cost efficient and environmentally sound, involving minimal waste effluents discharged from the process.
Our near-term focus is on the progression of the Demonstration Plant as further described below. Assuming the Demonstration Plant operation is successful, the Company plans to evaluate the feasibility of processing and separating REEs from the Bear Lodge REE Project as well as other sources at commercial scale.
During the first quarter of 2016, we placed the Bear Lodge REE Project under care-and-maintenance, and all permitting and licensing activities were suspended at that time. Based on current permitting and licensing timetables and other factors, we anticipate that we could receive all permits and licenses for the Bear Lodge REE Project approximately 18 to 30 months

after resuming permitting and licensing efforts, which efforts may be dependent upon our Demonstration Plant’s operating results.
Once the decision to resume the Bear Lodge REE Project development activities is made, our plan is to advance engineering in preparation for the FS, including an evaluation of a potential modular approach to development beginning with a smaller initial production facility utilizing high-grade material which could then be scaled up. Our ability to begin construction activities on the Bear Lodge REE Project may be subject to various factors including: (i) the availability of adequate capital, (ii) positive results from the Demonstration Plant’s operations, (iii) an affirmative FS, (iv) securing off-take agreements with customers at adequate prices, (v) obtaining necessary permits and licenses, and (vi) approval from the Company’s board of directors (the “Board of Directors” or the “Board”).
The Bear Lodge REE Project deposit is located near excellent mining infrastructure, including good road access and power lines within two kilometers of the property. Geographically, it is 100 kilometers east of Gillette, Wyoming, a major infrastructure, support, and logistics center for coal mines in the Powder River Basin that should provide for ready access to many of the required production supplies and materials as well as skilled labor. Additionally, the deposit is situated only 64 kilometers from the nearest railhead at Upton, Wyoming, where the Demonstration Plant and the proposed hydrometallurgical plant are planned to be sited, allowing access to major distribution channels via the adjacent railhead as well as convenient access to utilities and other infrastructure.
Additional information regarding the Bear Lodge REE Project and the Bear Lodge Property is included under the section heading “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report.
RECENT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS 
Rare Earth Demonstration Plant Project
​
Department of Energy Financial Award
​
In January 2021, a consortium of companies, of which the Company is a part, received notice from the DoE that the consortium had been selected for negotiation of a potential financial award for the engineering, construction and operation of a rare earth separation and processing Demonstration Plant. The consortium of companies is led by General Atomics, an affiliate of Synchron, the Company’s majority shareholder, and includes certain of General Atomics’ affiliates, and LNV, an Ardurra Group, Inc. company, as engineering and construction subcontractor. A formal proposal was submitted by the consortium in response to a published Funding Opportunity Announcement in mid-2020 for the construction and operation of a rare earth separation and processing plant utilizing proprietary technology to produce commercial-grade products. The DoE finalized the award, and an agreement was executed by the DoE’s grants/agreement officer on September 27, 2021, with an effective date of October 1, 2021. The Company, as a subrecipient of the award, along with the other consortium members, commenced work on the planning and design of the Demonstration Plant project in November 2021, with the Company’s contractual arrangement with General Atomics finalized in December 2021. The DoE funding is in the amount of $21,900 and represents approximately one-half of the total estimated costs for the Plant. The Demonstration Plant will process already stockpiled high-grade sample materials from the Bear Lodge REE Project.
​
To address the Company’s funding needs, during December 2021, the Company completed a rights offering for gross proceeds of approximately $25,400. The Company is using the net proceeds from the rights offering for the permitting, licensing, engineering, construction, and operation of the Demonstration Plant. The previously noted $21,900 financial award from the DoE is expected to fund approximately one-half of the projected total cost of the Demonstration Plant, with the balance of the required funding being provided by the Company utilizing the proceeds of the rights offering and other funding sources. 
During 2022, the Company, along with the other consortium members, progressed their work on the Demonstration Plant, and this work is expected to continue through the Plant’s anticipated completion date of operations in the early part of 2025. Through December 31, 2022, the Company had paid to General Atomics, as leader of the consortium, a total of $6,700 toward its share of the expected cost of the Demonstration Plant (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a more complete discussion).

​
In December 2022, the Demonstration Plant achieved its final engineering design milestone marking the completion of the DoE’s first go/no-go decision point. The completion of this milestone was a gating event for the DoE’s continued funding of the Demonstration Plant as provided for in the 2021 award grant. Future gating milestones include the expected completion of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”) licensing and DoE National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (“NEPA”) review in the second half of 2023 and the completion of the Plant’s construction in the second half of 2024. Operations to process and separate the REE from the stockpiled sample materials are expected to follow the completion of the Plant’s construction for an additional eight-to-10-month period. 
​
Wyoming Energy Authority Financial Award 
​
In November 2022, the Company received notice that it had been awarded a $4,400 grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority (“WEA”) to be used toward the advancement of the Demonstration Plant. The WEA grant is a cost-reimbursement award that will be available to the Company for future Demonstration Plant expenses. At December 31, 2022, the terms of this grant were still being finalized and no amount of the $4,400 award had been received by the Company. Depending on the award’s final terms and conditions, the Company may be able to claim a portion of the $4,400 grant during 2023. No amounts related to this grant have been included in the Company’s December 31, 2022 financial statements. 
​
Future Funding Needs
​
Even with the completion of the 2021 rights offering and expected receipt of the WEA grant, the Company will not have sufficient funds to progress its longer-term activities beyond the Demonstration Plant’s operational period, including feasibility studies, permitting, licensing, and development and construction related to the Bear Lodge REE Project. Therefore, the achievement of these longer-term activities will be dependent upon the receipt of additional funds through financings, off-take agreements, joint ventures, strategic transactions, or sales of various assets. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in completing such other financings or transactions. Ultimately, in the event that the Company cannot secure additional financial resources, or complete a strategic transaction in the longer term, it may need to suspend its operational plans or even have to liquidate its business interests, and investors may lose all or part of their investment.
Current External Factors Impacting our Business
​
Throughout 2022, we continued to monitor the general U.S. political climate and actions taken by the U.S. government to secure a domestic, rare earth supply chain. The U.S. federal government issued two Presidential Executive Orders in 2017 to encourage and support the establishment of a domestic rare earth supply chain and to strengthen the defense industrial base with respect to critical minerals including rare earths. In June 2019, the Department of Commerce released its report entitled “Federal strategy to ensure secure and reliable supplies of critical minerals.” This was followed by five U.S. Presidential Determinations on July 22, 2019, directed to the Secretary of Defense. One Presidential Determination declared that “the domestic production capability for Rare Earth Metals and Alloys is essential to the national defense.” These initiatives have increased the federal government’s level of interest in the rare earth industry and our potential rare earth products as a critical upstream segment of the supply chain, particularly considering China’s dominance in the global rare earth market. 
In addition, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and other external influences (such as the Russia/Ukraine war) have further focused the U.S. government on the importance of implementing secure domestic supply chains, including for rare earths, leading to a further Presidential Executive Order issued in February 2021 calling for an expedited 100-day review to address the strengthening of America’s supply chains, specifically requiring the Department of Defense to (i) submit a report identifying “risks in the supply chain of critical minerals and other strategic materials including rare earth elements” and (ii) make policy recommendations to address the risks. The 100-day review led to another Executive Order on June 8, 2021, calling for an investment in sustainable domestic and international production and processing of critical minerals, including a recommendation that Congress take actions to recapitalize and restore the National Defense Stockpile of critical minerals and materials. The Company monitors and participates in these initiatives as they are critical to the production of rare earth magnets used in the United States to support the manufacturing of, among other things, defense technologies, electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and oil refining equipment.

TRENDS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE REE MARKET
Uses for REE Products
Due to variations in physical, chemical, molecular and application characteristics, different rare earth metals possess their own market uses, drivers and challenges. REEs are used in computers, cellular telephones, television screens, wind turbines, fuel cells, automobiles, magnetic refrigeration, energy-efficient lighting, petroleum-refining catalysts, and numerous other modern specialty technologies including military applications. Lately, the major driver for the rare earth metals market has been the increasing consumption in the manufacture of permanent NdFeB rare earth magnets, in which rare earth metals such as Nd, Pr, Tb, and Dy are used. Specifically, these REEs are used in hybrid and electric vehicle motors as well as in wind turbines. Ce, La, and other REE are widely used in applications such as metallurgy, catalysts, glass, ceramics, optical instruments, and polishing.
Trends Affecting REE Supply, Demand and Prices 
In 2022, rare earth mine production increased by approximately 17% to 312,000 tonnes REO relative to 2021 with refined production estimated to be 205,000 tonnes REO, a 13% increase from 2021. Production from China accounted for most of the increase. China dominates the global supply of rare earths at both the mined and refined stages, accounting for 65% of global mine production and 87% of refined production in 2022. China’s share of global mine production is partly influenced by U.S. production of concentrates which are sent to China for downstream refining. 
In the rest of the world, specifically in the U.S. and Australia, certain competitors constitute the second tier of rare earth concentrate producing companies, with 42,000 tonnes REO mine production from the U.S. and approximately 36,000 tonnes REO mine production from Australia. A facility in Malaysia produces separated rare earths from REO mine production in Australia.

The rapid growth in demand for certain REE, specifically Nd and Pr used in permanent magnets for motors and generators, is expected to continue as these magnets give improved performance compared with other magnets. Increased focus on clean energy is pushing the demand for wind turbines and electric vehicles, which in turn will drive the demand for rare earth magnets in electric motor and generator applications. Magnet demand now accounts for more than 40% of total rare earth demand and greater than 80% of REE market value.
The research and advisory firm, Wood Mackenzie Limited (“Wood Mackenzie”), is forecasting that magnet applications, particularly automotive motors, and wind energy generation, will continue to increase their share of overall demand for rare earth magnets rising from 45% in 2022 to 54% in 2032. This increase in demand for magnet rare earths, namely Nd-Pr, Dy and Tb oxides, is expected to drive future growth above other rare earth compounds and support higher prices. Growth in the automotive sector is expected to be led by battery electric vehicles (BEV) with a 16.0% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) and 12,700 tonnes REO consumption in 2023 with growth in the energy generation sector coming from an increase in the installed capacity of wind turbines averaging a CAGR of 9.6% from 2022 to 2032. During 2022, the annual global demand for rare earth oxides for use in permanent magnets reached 76,400 tonnes REO, representing 44% of total REE demand. 
Supply and demand factors for REE products that could positively impact future REE prices include the following, among other factors:




● | the use of Nd, Pr, Tb and Dy in high-strength magnets that are critical to multiple defense applications, hybrid and electric vehicles and wind power generation facilities, particularly large off-shore installations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the continued research and commercialization of new applications for REE products; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the rising costs in China due to stricter environmental controls and rising wages.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Supply and demand factors for REE products that could negatively impact future REE prices include the following, among other factors:




● | the potential for oversupply of certain REEs due to new production inside and outside of China and/or increased exports from China;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | development or enhancements of alternative electric motor or generator technologies that may use less of no REE magnet materials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | strong demand for selected REEs like magnet materials, driving overproduction of other co-product REEs and creating oversupply conditions for non-magnet REEs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the potential substitution of other materials for higher-priced REEs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | economization by intermediate and end-users to reduce the usage of REEs in end-products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the potential for increased recycling of higher-priced REEs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | fluctuating oil, gas and coal prices that could reduce the demand for technologies using REEs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | static or lower global economic growth, reducing overall demand growth for REEs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | potential by-product production of REEs that may increase supply irrespective of the economics of REE production from primary mines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The feasibility of the Bear Lodge REE Project and our ability to raise additional funds to develop the Bear Lodge REE Project may be impacted by global supply and demand and future prices of REEs.
SEASONALITY
At this stage, seasonality in the state of Wyoming is not a material factor to any future exploration, development, and operating activities on the Bear Lodge Property. Snowfall in the winter may temporarily limit our access to the Bear Lodge Property and our ability to explore, operate, or transport sample materials to Upton, Wyoming for use in the Demonstration Plant or a future commercial-scale processing facility from approximately November through June.
COMPETITION 
The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other mining and exploration companies, both within the U.S. and internationally, for the exploration and development of mineral properties and production of REEs as well as funding for projects. There is competition for the limited number of opportunities, some involving companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff, and facilities than we do, and some with rare earth operational experience. We also compete with other mining and exploration companies in our efforts to hire and retain experienced professionals. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting or retaining key personnel or securing outside technical resources.
In 2022, China accounted for an estimated 65% of global REE mine production and 87% of refined production. Wood McKenzie has forecasted that China will remain the primary source of mine supply over the next decade, accounting for 58% by 2032. China will remain the largest contributor of refined supply, projected to produce 65% (218.5 kt REO) in 2032. In similar fashion, the distribution of demand will remain Asia focused with China maintaining a dominant position, accounting for 48% of total rare earth demand in 2032. This gives the Chinese producers a competitive advantage in controlling the supply and processing of REEs and an opportunity to influence prices to discourage competition. Any increase in the amount of REEs exported from other nations increases supply and may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of potential market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. As a result of 

11



these factors, the Company may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES 
We rely on a combination of trade secret protection, nondisclosure agreements, trademarks, and patents to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights in our rare earth technology. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had filed U.S. provisional patent applications relating to processing methods, including (1) selective recovery of REEs from mixed chloride leach solutions using oxalic acid, and (2) separation of thorium from bulk REEs in a solvent extraction (“SX”) process. These provisional applications provided the basis for the current patent portfolio, which includes two issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. divisional patent, one pending foreign application, and fourteen issued foreign patents across thirteen foreign jurisdictions.  The issued U.S. patents have a term of 20 years measured from the filing date of the utility patent applications. We licensed our intellectual property, including patents and related technical information to Synchron in October 2017, in which the license became exclusive to Synchron and its affiliates in October 2019. The Company retains a limited use right to use its intellectual property and any enhancements thereto. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. Several of these technologies have potential value for application in other industries.  
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
Our exploration and planned development, mining and processing activities are subject to extensive and demanding environmental laws and regulations under various federal, state, county and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, which generally includes air and water quality, hazardous waste management, radionuclide handling and reclamation. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal liability for non-compliance, fines and penalties, clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Also, unanticipated developments or changes in the law could require us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect. Environmental laws historically have evolved in a manner that requires stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors, and employees. Current and future laws, regulations and permits will impose significant costs, liabilities or obligations or could limit or prevent our ability to continue operations or undertake new operations. A future change in the U.S. presidential administration or in the composition of the Congress could result in more stringent environmental regulation of our operations. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we hold interests that are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by previous owners of the properties.
Our Bear Lodge Property in Wyoming is subject to federal and state environmental laws, regulations, and permits. The federal agency with primary regulatory jurisdiction is the U.S. Forest Service (the “USFS”), Bear lodge Ranger District, Sundance, Wyoming. The state agency with regulatory jurisdiction is the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. We operate under approvals and permits granted by these two agencies and have established a surety bond to ensure environmental reclamation of areas disturbed. As of December 31, 2022, the Company holds a surety bond with the state of Wyoming of $132. Prior to operating, we will require several other permits and licenses including those issued by the NRC, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and others.
MINERALS EXPLORATION REGULATION
Mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, county and local laws and regulations in the U.S. that govern prospecting, exploration, development, mining, production, processing, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, and other matters. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations. There are no current orders or notices of violations relating to the Company under applicable laws and regulations.

12



Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the Company and could subject it to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations, or changes to current requirements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.
MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH REGULATIONS
Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd–Frank Act”), issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the U.S. are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. During the year ended December 31, 2022, our Bear Lodge Property was not subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.
EMPLOYEES
At December 31, 2022, we had two full-time employees and no part-time employees. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements. When required, our employees will engage the services of third parties under consulting or service agreements.
AVAILABLE INFORMATION
