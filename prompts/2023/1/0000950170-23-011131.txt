 Overview
We are a late-clinical stage, cell therapy company developing an innovative method of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) that we believe has the potential to transform the standard of care in solid organ transplantation, certain severe autoimmune diseases and certain severe blood, immune and metabolic disorders. We believe our proprietary therapeutic approach, which we call Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy, could prevent organ rejection without the morbidity and mortality that has been associated with the use of lifelong anti-rejection medicines, also known as chronic immunosuppression. Beyond the organ transplant setting, our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy also has the potential to treat a range of severe autoimmune diseases and severe blood, immune and metabolic disorders, in each case with potential for similar outcomes to what has previously been observed with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), while mitigating the toxicities, morbidities and extended hospital stay associated with the conditioning regimen typically required by HSCT. We believe that our target indications, individually and collectively, represent a significant unmet need and commercial opportunity.
In February 2023, we announced the discontinuation of our FREEDOM-1 and FREEDOM-2 clinical trials evaluating FCR001’s ability to induce durable tolerance in living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) recipients. This decision was primarily attributable to the pace of enrollment and the associated timeline to critical milestones.
In February 2023, we also announced a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value, including, but not limited to, an acquisition, merger, possible business combinations and/or a divestiture of the Company’s cell therapy chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) capabilities. We expect to devote substantial time and resources to exploring strategic alternatives that our board of directors believes will maximize stockholder value. Despite devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, there can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms or at all. We have not set a timetable for completion of this strategic review process, and our board of directors has not approved a definitive course of action. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value, or that we will make any additional cash distributions to our stockholders.
 In March 2023, pending the outcome of our review of strategic alternatives, we voluntarily paused enrollment in our FREEDOM-3 Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating FCR001’s ability to induce tolerance in diffuse systemic sclerosis, a severe autoimmune disease, while continuing to evaluate patients for potential future enrollment.
 Our lead product candidate, FCR001, which is central to our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy, is a novel allogeneic cell therapy comprised of stem and immune cells that are procured from a healthy donor, who is also the organ donor in the case of organ transplantation. FCR001 is rapidly processed in our good manufacturing practices (GMP) facility using our proprietary manufacturing methods. Then, at the time of transplant, FCR001 is administered to the recipient following nonmyeloablative conditioning, which is designed to be less toxic than myeloablative conditioning. A fully myeloablative conditioning regimen consists of a combination of agents and high doses of total body irradiation that destroy hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow and results in profound depletion of HSC-derived cells within one to three weeks following administration that is irreversible, and in most instances is fatal unless rescued by a stem cell transplant. The nonmyeloablative conditioning for FCR001 entails lower doses of chemotherapy and total body irradiation, causes less depletion of blood cells and does not require stem cell support for the recipient to resume the production of blood cells and platelets. We do not outsource any key aspect of our cell processing. We have focused on developing FCR001 as a pipeline-in-a-product with the potential to address the therapeutic areas described above.
 FREEDOM-1 was a randomized, controlled, open-label Phase 3 registration trial in the United States of FCR001 in 120 adult LDKT recipients. The goal of this trial was to evaluate the potential of FCR001, when administered the day after the kidney transplant, to induce durable, drug-free immune tolerance in the recipient of the transplanted kidney. In November 2021, June 2022 and October 2022, we provided updates on patients dosed in the FREEDOM-1 Phase 3 clinical trial.
In November 2021, we announced that all patients treated with FCR001 at least three months prior had achieved T-cell chimerism levels greater than 50% at each of the 3-, 6-, and 12-month timepoints post-transplant, which has correlated strongly with the patient’s ability to durably discontinue chronic immunosuppression (IS) without subsequent graft rejection. Further, we announced that the overall safety profile of Phase 3 patients dosed at the time with FCR001 was consistent with that observed in our Phase 2 study of FCR001.
In June 2022, we provided further updates on patients dosed in the FREEDOM-1 trial, announcing that a total of seven patients had been dosed and that all patients dosed at least three months prior to the cutoff date had achieved and maintained T-cell chimerism levels >50% at each of the 3-, 6- and 12-month timepoints post-transplant. All three of the patients dosed more than 12 months prior to

the data cutoff date have been successfully weaned off all chronic anti-rejection drugs. The longest at that time had been followed for 24 months post-transplant. We also reported three cases of low-grade (grade II) acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD). One of these patients was more than 12 months post-transplant and, notwithstanding their treatment-responsive aGvHD, has been weaned off all anti-rejection drugs. One of the three aGvHD patients was subsequently diagnosed with moderate chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) and at that time was responding to treatment. No trial stopping rules were triggered by the GvHD cases, and trial screening and enrollment continued. However, to investigate these aGvHD cases, we conducted an internal review of all GvHD cases in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. This review prompted implementation of an amendment to the trial protocol. We reported that the incidence of GvHD in FCR001 subjects was correlated with high CD34+ cell counts and high total nucleated cell counts in the FCR001 product candidate. We also noted a correlation between the use of plerixafor as a donor mobilizing agent and an increased risk of GvHD, as plerixafor significantly increased CD34+ and total nucleated cell counts in the FCR001 product. At that time, we introduced two risk mitigation measures for GvHD in the amended trial protocol: (1) elimination of plerixafor as a donor mobilizing agent, and (2) addition of a second post-transplant dose of cyclophosphamide, which has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of severe GvHD in haplo-identical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (Elmariah H, Fuchs EJ. Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide to facilitate HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation: Mechanisms and results. Semin Hematol. 2019 Jul;56(3):183-189).
 In October 2022, we received a report of a patient death, which triggered a pre-specified, temporary stopping requirement and review by the FREEDOM-1 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). After their review of this case, the DMC determined that trial enrollment and dosing may continue. We reported this event and the DMC’s recommendation to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The patient had been hospitalized with grade IV GvHD that was complicated by serious infections leading to respiratory and renal failure, and ultimately death. We also reported that, as of October 2022, the other two FREEDOM-1 patients who were previously reported to have had grade II aGvHD have since experienced complete resolution of their aGvHD symptoms, although one patient experienced additional flares that were also responsive to treatment. After reviewing the data, the DMC concluded that the FREEDOM-1 protocol modifications implemented in June 2022 should be sufficient to mitigate the risk of GvHD going forward, and recommended continuation of the trial without further modifications. Despite this recommendation, trial enrollment remained below expectations, and we ultimately terminated our clinical trials in LDKT.
 The primary endpoint of our Phase 2 trial was to determine whether the administration of FCR001 can induce durable tolerance to the donated kidney and substantially reduce or eliminate the requirement for immunosuppression within 12 months following transplant. In our Phase 2 trial, 26 of 37 LDKT patients treated with FCR001 (70%) were able to completely discontinue their chronic immunosuppression approximately one year after receiving their transplant. After mid-course optimizations to the Phase 2 protocol, 14 of the last 17 patients (82%) in the trial were able to discontinue their chronic immunosuppression by approximately one year post-transplant. Every transplant recipient who was weaned off immunosuppression has remained off chronic immunosuppression, without any organ rejection, for the duration of their follow-up through March 1, 2023. As of that date, we had followed these patients for a median of 9.0 years post-transplant, and the longest for 14.0 years post-transplant. These results were achieved despite significant degrees of immune system human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch between the donors and recipients, and the degree of immune mismatch between the donor and recipient did not appear to impact the safety or efficacy of our therapy candidate.
We identified a near-term surrogate marker, chimerism, that we believe to be highly predictive of the ability of an organ transplant recipient to durably discontinue chronic immunosuppression at one year post-transplant without rejecting the transplanted organ. Chimerism refers to a state whereby the recipient’s and donor’s blood and immune cells co-exist in the recipient, creating a reciprocal state of immune tolerance called allogeneic tolerance. We use a simple blood test to measure and regularly monitor the degree of donor chimerism in the recipient, which has to date shown a close association in our research with long-term immune tolerance in patients who have received FCR001. In our Phase 2 trial of FCR001, we observed that 26 of 27 recipients (96%) who achieved donor chimerism at six months post-transplant were successfully weaned off chronic immunosuppression over approximately the next six months, including recipients who were highly HLA-unmatched and/or unrelated to their donors. In addition, donor chimerism at three months post-transplant, which we observed in 26 of 29 recipients (90%), was also highly predictive of successful weaning off chronic immunosuppression at approximately one year post-transplant.


Through the termination of our clinical trials in LDKT, we monitored the patients in our Phase 2 trial for long term safety and durability of effect. Through March 1, 2023, we had accumulated approximately 316 patient-years of exposure to FCR001 in LDKT, and the safety profile in our patients is generally consistent with that expected if a patient were to separately receive both a standard kidney transplant and an allo-HSCT with nonmyeloablative conditioning. Specifically in our Phase 2 population, through March 1, 2023, there were four deaths and two cases of GvHD, which is a condition that occurs when donated stem cells attack the recipient. The most commonly reported serious adverse events were fever, deep vein thrombosis, including among several patients who had predisposing factors such as central venous catheter placements or Factor V deficiency, diarrhea, pneumonia and febrile neutropenia (or low white blood cell counts with a high fever). Preliminary data indicates that patients who were able to be weaned off immunosuppression with FCR001 had preserved kidney function and third-party data suggests a markedly lower reliance on cardiovascular medications at four years post-transplant compared to traditional transplants with chronic immunosuppression over a similar time frame. Based on the data generated from our Phase 2 trial, FDA has granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) and Orphan Drug Designation for FCR001 for LDKT.
Under our open investigational new drug application (IND), the FDA has cleared us, based in part upon the data to date from our ongoing Phase 2 trial, to proceed with an updated protocol for our Phase 2 FREEDOM-2 trial, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021. In FREEDOM-2, we had been evaluating the potential of FCR001 to induce durable immune tolerance in patients who have previously received a kidney from a living donor, which is a process called delayed tolerance. In this trial, FCR001 either was or would have been administered between three and twelve months after the initial kidney transplant.
Additionally, the FDA has cleared our IND, based in part upon the data to date from our ongoing Phase 2 trial, to proceed with our Phase 2 FREEDOM-3 trial, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021. In FREEDOM-3, we were evaluating the safety and efficacy of FCR001 in adults with a severe form of scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disease. In our Phase 2 LDKT trial, all seven LDKT patients who required a kidney transplant as a result of a kidney-related autoimmune disease, and who achieved durable chimerism and could be withdrawn from chronic immunosuppression at one year, have not experienced recurrence of their prior kidney-related autoimmune disease. We believe that this observation, as well as the current use of HSCT for severe scleroderma, supports the potential of our therapy in autoimmune diseases. We believe that positive data in the FREEDOM-3 trial in severe scleroderma patients could support the potential applicability of FCR001 to other severe, systemic autoimmune diseases.
We own unencumbered, worldwide rights to all of our product candidates and technologies.
Our manufacturing strategy is designed to meet the high quality and demand needs of clinical supply and commercial launch of any approved product. We manufacture FCR001 in less than a day at our GMP cell processing facility, employing robust, reproducible, proprietary methods which remain substantially unchanged since we progressed FCR001 from Phase 2 to the Phase 3 FREEDOM-1 clinical trial. We do not outsource any key aspect of our cell processing. Unlike gene therapies or chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, our manufacturing process does not employ viral vectors, nor do we perform any transductions or ex vivo cell expansions.
Our Strategy
As announced in February 2023, our current goal is to complete a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value, including, but not limited to, an acquisition, merger, possible business combinations and/or a divestiture of the Company’s cell therapy CMC capabilities. We expect to devote substantial time and resources to exploring strategic alternatives that our board of directors believes will maximize stockholder value. Despite devoting significant efforts to identify and evaluate potential strategic alternatives, there can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in us pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed on attractive terms or at all. We have not set a timetable for completion of this strategic review process, and our board of directors has not approved a definitive course of action. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased stockholder value, or that we will make any additional cash distributions to our stockholders.
 In February 2023, we announced the discontinuation of our FREEDOM-1 and FREEDOM-2 clinical trials evaluating FCR001’s ability to induce durable tolerance in LDKT recipients. This decision was primarily attributable to the pace of enrollment and the associated timeline to critical milestones. Furthermore, in March 2023, pending the outcome of our review of strategic alternatives, we voluntarily paused enrollment in our FREEDOM-3 Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating FCR001’s ability to induce tolerance in diffuse systemic sclerosis, a severe autoimmune disease, while continuing to evaluate patients for potential future enrollment.


In connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives and in order to extend our resources, we implemented a restructuring plan that included reducing our workforce by approximately one-third, with remaining employees primarily focused on maintaining the Company’s cell therapy CMC capabilities and executing FREEDOM-3.
 Overview of Immune Intolerant Indications and Current Treatment Approaches
Immune Tolerance and HLA Inheritance
The human immune system is composed of cells that mature from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs are immature cells found primarily in the bone marrow that can develop into all types of blood and immune cells that protect individuals against infection, tumors, and other pathogens. In healthy individuals, the immune system distinguishes “self” antigens from “non-self” foreign antigens (e.g., transplanted organs, infectious agents or cancerous cells) and selectively mounts a protective attack against “non-self” foreign antigens while avoiding an attack on “self” antigens. The immune system’s natural process for not mounting an immune response to antigens it deems as “self” is referred to as immune tolerance. An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune system mistakenly recognizes some aspect of “self” as “non-self” and attacks those cells or tissues.
The immune system distinguishes “self” versus “non-self” predominantly via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC is a group of proteins expressed on the surface of most cells that function to present “self” or “non-self” antigens to lymphocytes, which mediate the immune response against antigens that are recognized as “non-self.” In humans, the MHC is composed of highly genetically diverse MHC proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). As depicted in the figure below, human cells express combinations of multiple HLA proteins that collectively define an individual’s unique “tissue type” or a distinct molecular “self” signature.
The genes that encode HLAs are inherited in sets called haplotypes. An individual inherits one haplotype from each parent; as a result, their tissue type is 50% matched, or haploidentical to each parent’s tissue type. As shown in the figure below, if two children inherit the same HLA haplotypes from their parents, they are fully HLA matched. Siblings have a one in four chance of having a complete HLA match in their tissue types. Even if 100% HLA-matched, siblings are not genetically identical unless they are identical twins.
Illustration of HLA Matching



Although the immune system plays a vital role in eliminating pathogens and damaged cells, it poses significant challenges in two distinct areas where immune-mediated attack of antigens deemed non-self is detrimental: (1) allogeneic transplantation of solid organs, such as kidneys, or of HSCs; and (2) autoimmune diseases.
Allo-HSCT
Allo-HSCT has been used to replace diseased immune, blood or stem cells in patients with severe immune, blood or metabolic disorders. In allo-HSCT, an HLA-matched, healthy donor’s HSCs are first procured, then the patient’s own HSCs (and their associated immune and blood systems) are eliminated by high dose chemotherapy and radiation in a process known as myeloablative conditioning. The donor’s HSCs are then transplanted to the patient. If the donor’s HSCs engraft in the recipient’s bone marrow, and are not rejected in the months following, then they will differentiate into donor-derived immune and blood cells.
In allo-HSCT, less-than-perfect HLA matching can increase the potential for GvHD. GvHD occurs when immune cells that are produced by donor-derived stem cells that have engrafted in the recipient attack the recipient’s body as “non-self.” GvHD, which can be acute (within the first 100 days following transplant) or chronic (beyond 100 days), can cause potentially life-threatening damage to the liver, skin, mucosal tissues, and gastrointestinal tract. Current medical practice for HLA matching in allo-HSCT is more stringent than for solid organ transplantation. Specifically, in solid organ transplant, HLA matching is based on a panel of six HLA proteins, whereas in HSC transplant, HLA matching is based on a more stringent panel of ten HLA proteins. Thus, in allo-HSCT, a ten out of ten match of HLA proteins is strongly preferred, with a minimum requirement for at least a haploidentical match of five out of ten. If individuals in need of allo-HSCT cannot find a suitable donor match, they cannot benefit from the curative potential of this procedure because the risk of GvHD is unacceptably high. As a result, although allo-HSCT also has the potential to restore self-tolerance in patients with autoimmune disease, it is seldom used for autoimmune disease because of the challenge of finding a highly HLA-matched donor and associated concerns over the risk of GvHD.
Although there is no currently approved, standard regimen to prevent GvHD, patients may receive peri-procedural treatment with cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids and other therapies. GvHD can develop in up to 50% of individuals receiving allo-HSCT, depending on the conditioning regimen, underlying disease, and degree of HLA mismatch between donor and recipient. Treatment of acute or chronic GvHD, which can range in severity from Grade 1 (mild) to Grade 4 (severe), depends on the extent of tissue and organ involvement, with corticosteroids generally serving as the typical first-line treatment. Nearly half of patients with acute GvHD are refractory to first-line steroid treatment and may receive treatment with second line therapies such as ruxolitinib. However, ruxolitinib can have limited efficacy, and its side effects include anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, infections, and edema. Thus, there is a significant need for an approach to allo-HSCT that could enable reciprocal tolerance between the donor’s and recipient’s tissues and immune cells, irrespective of the degree of HLA match, thereby lowering the risk of GvHD in the allo-HSCT recipient.
Autoimmune Diseases
In healthy individuals, the immune system produces cells that are potentially capable of attacking “self”, but such cells are either eliminated or silenced by regulatory mechanisms within the body. However, if these mechanisms fail, or if an infection introduces a foreign antigen that mimics a self-antigen, the immune system can mount an attack on an individual’s own cells, tissues, or organs, either locally or systemically. This phenomenon is termed autoimmune disease, and reflects the absence of immune tolerance to some aspect of self. There are more than 80 recognized types of autoimmune diseases.
The discovery and understanding of several key molecular pathways and mediators of pathological inflammation have led to the approval of several immunomodulatory therapies (e.g., anti-cytokines, co-stimulatory blockers and interferons) that improve symptoms and delay progression of debilitating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. However, these therapies require chronic, repeated administration to maintain significant benefit, and can be associated with side effects and toxicities similar to other immunosuppressive therapies. No therapies approved to date have been shown to be curative of autoimmune disease or to effectively restore durable immune tolerance to self-antigens.
HSCT is not an approved treatment for autoimmune disorders, but it has been observed to have curative potential for certain severe autoimmune diseases—notably scleroderma, multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease—in clinical trials conducted by third parties, albeit with the significant limitations described above. To date, autologous HSCT has been preferred to allo-HSCT in these trials because the latter carries a significant risk of GvHD, as well as a greater risk that the donated stem cells will fail to engraft in the recipient.
In autologous HSCT, a patient’s HSCs are first procured and then the patient’s entire immune system, including the autoreactive cells, is eliminated by myeloablative conditioning. The previously procured stem cells are then transplanted back into the patient, where they engraft and then differentiate into mature immune cells. The underlying principle is that these newly created immune cells have the potential to reset the patient’s immune system, and enable disease remission.

Autologous HSCT has two major limitations. First, the acute toxicity of myeloablative conditioning, notably to the heart, lungs, and kidneys, necessitates a long and costly hospitalization—on average 20 days with billed charges of over $250,000—and restricts its use solely to the patients who can tolerate its intensity. Moreover, there are important long-term complications of myeloablative conditioning, including significantly increased risk of infections and hematological malignancies. Second, since these patients likely have a genetic predisposition towards autoimmune diseases, there is a higher risk of recurrence, which should be lower if stem cells were transplanted from a healthy allogeneic donor. Our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy has the potential to mitigate both of these key limitations. As a result, we believe there is an opportunity with our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy to improve and safely expand the practice of HSCT to a greater number of patients and induce durable remissions in severe autoimmune diseases.
Chimerism and Inducible Allogeneic Tolerance
As depicted in the figure below, chimerism refers to a state in which both the donor’s HSCs and the recipient’s HSCs co-exist in the recipient’s bone marrow. These co-existing HSCs in turn produce blood and immune cells of both donor and recipient origin. We believe chimerism is the most robust means of inducing durable allogeneic tolerance.
The Concept of Chimerism


Allogeneic tolerance refers to a chimeric state in which the recipient’s preexisting immune system and the donor’s transplanted immune system (which co-exist in the recipient following our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy) mutually recognize the other’s cells and tissues as “self”, thereby evading immune-mediated rejection and GvHD. We believe allogeneic tolerance can be achieved by transplanting a healthy donor’s HSCs so that they coexist with the recipient’s HSCs in the recipient’s bone marrow, thereby creating a “dual hematopoietic system” (part-donor and part-recipient) in the recipient. The dual hematopoietic system in turn produces cells that constitute coexisting immune- and blood systems. If the donor’s T-cells constitute more than 50% of the detectable T-cells in the recipient’s blood for six months or longer after the transplant, our Phase 2 data have shown that this is highly predictive of the recipient having achieved durable chimerism, and thus durable allogeneic tolerance.
We believe inducible allogeneic tolerance has therapeutic potential in three broad categories of clinical applications: (1) solid organ transplantation; (2) severe autoimmune disease; and (3) severe blood, immune and metabolic disorders that have been shown to be potentially curable via allo-HSCT.
Our Therapeutic Approach: Facilitated Allo-HSCT to Induce Allogeneic Tolerance
The goal of our proprietary, investigational Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy is to induce allogeneic tolerance for the treatment of multiple therapeutic conditions with significant unmet need. While the principle of inducing allogeneic tolerance has been understood for decades, its clinical application in humans via allo-HSCT has proven elusive due to two key challenges: (1) minimizing the risks of graft rejection and/or GvHD, irrespective of the degree of matching of the donor’s and recipient’s HLA antigens and (2) identifying a better-tolerated, nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen (as opposed to a fully myeloablative conditioning regimen) that nonetheless enables durable engraftment of donor cells into the recipient. We believe that our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy has the potential to address these two challenges and could represent a major advance in unlocking potential clinical applications for induced tolerance by

restoring tolerance to self-antigens in patients with severe autoimmune diseases, we believe that our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy has the potential to induce durable remission without the need for chronic immunosuppression.
Our lead product candidate, FCR001, which is central to our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy, is a proprietary, one-time, investigational cell therapy derived from donor-mobilized peripheral blood cells, which are processed to contain an optimized number of the donor’s HSCs, FCs, and ßTCR+ T-cells. As depicted in the figure below, these three distinct cell types and the combination of these cell populations are critical for the safety and efficacy of FCR001. Specifically:
•HSCs are progenitor cells that are used to rebuild the hematopoietic and immune system of the recipient. As a result of their engraftment, the recipient’s new immune system will reflect the donor’s genotype and, thus, can potentially recognize the donor cells and tissues as “self” without the need for chronic immunosuppression. 
 •Facilitating Cells (FCs) are defined by the cell surface expression of the CD8 protein and by the lack of a functional T-cell receptor (TCR) (CD8+/TCR-). FCs are a mixed cell population that we believe to be responsible for fast and efficient engraftment of donor HSCs to promote chimerism. In addition, in preclinical studies, FCs have been observed to be associated with a reduced risk of GvHD relative to standard allo-HSCT. Consistent with these data, we have observed a very low incidence of GvHD in our Phase 2 trial of FCR001, despite a high degree of HLA mismatch between most donors and recipients. 
 •ßTCR+ T-cells are known to support donor HSC engraftment in recipients who receive allo-HSCT from an HLA-mismatched donor with nonmyeloablative conditioning, but they are also known to increase the risk of acute GvHD in the recipient. FCR001 incorporates an optimized number of ßTCR+ T-cells that are intended to promote engraftment of the donor’s HSCs in the recipient while minimizing the risk of acute GvHD. 
 Active Cell Type Composition of FCR001


The FCR001 manufacturing process is designed to limit the number of ßTCR+ T-cells to a desired number in the cell therapy product candidate while optimizing the yield of HSCs and FCs obtained after apheresis of the donor. See “Preclinical Studies: Facilitating Cell Mechanism of Action,” below, for a summary of some of the key preclinical data supporting the mechanism of action of FCR001.
Based on the clinical evidence we have observed in our Phase 2 trial, we believe FCR001, and our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy more broadly, can potentially be applied to numerous therapeutic areas. We are currently advancing FCR001 in severe autoimmune disease. This area of focus can extend beyond severe autoimmune disease. We retain global development and commercial rights for FCR001 in all indications.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated our first clinical trial in autoimmune diseases, FREEDOM-3, a Phase 2 trial exploring the safety and clinical activity of FCR001 in patients with a severe form of scleroderma. We believe that positive proof of concept data in this trial could support the potential applicability of FCR001 to other severe, systemic autoimmune diseases. In March 2023, pending the outcome of our review of strategic alternatives, we voluntarily paused enrollment in our FREEDOM-3 Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating FCR001's ability to induce tolerance in diffuse systemic sclerosis, a severe autoimmune disease, while continuing to evaluate patients for potential future enrollment.
Our Programs
Reprogram: Solid Organ Transplantation
We believe FCR001 has the potential to induce durable allogeneic tolerance in LDKT recipients to their transplanted organ, thereby permitting the LDKT recipient to discontinue all chronic immunosuppression within approximately twelve months of their transplant, without rejecting the transplanted organ. FCR001 is a single-dose, personalized investigational therapy that is made from stem and immune cells procured from the kidney donor, that are processed at our GMP facility to specifications that are optimized for the transplant recipient. FCR001 is infused into the transplant recipient within a day of the LDKT.
 Overview of Our Phase 2 Trial
We conducted an our open-label, single-arm Phase 2 trial to investigate whether administration of FCR001 along with nonmyeloablative conditioning can induce durable immune tolerance to a donated kidney in adult LDKT recipients. Although this trial is no longer active, the FCR001-dosed patients were monitored for up to 14 years from the time of their transplant until March 1, 2023 in order to provide long-term follow-up safety and durability data.
Thirty-seven patients were dosed between 2009 and 2016 at Northwestern Medical Center (n=36) and Duke University Hospital (n=1). The first four patients dosed at Northwestern Medical Center were treated under a compassionate use exemption, but we consider these patients to be part of our Phase 2 trial because they were treated with the same FCR001 product and under substantially the same protocol as the subsequent 33 patients. Eligible donor and recipient pairs were adults between the ages of 18 to 65 who met trial eligibility criteria. All levels of immune HLA mismatching between donor and recipients were allowed.
The primary endpoint of the trial was to determine whether the administration of FCR001 can induce durable tolerance to the donated kidney and substantially reduce or eliminate the requirement for immunosuppression within 12 months following transplant.
Phase 2 LDKT study design


As of March 1, 2023, the median follow-up of the 37 patients who received LDKT and FCR001 was 8.9 years, with the longest follow-up being 14.0 years. Moreover, as of such time, 33 recipients had at least 36 months of follow-up, and 30 patients had at least 60 months of follow-up. As of March 1, 2023, we have accumulated a total of approximately 316 patient-years of exposure to FCR001 in LDKT.

Our Phase 2 Results—Clinical Activity
As depicted in the flowchart below, 37 patients received LDKT as well as our investigational therapy, FCR001, plus nonmyeloablative conditioning. As of March 1, 2023, the results were as follows:
Phase 2 Clinical Trial Results as of March 1, 2023


* Chimerism lost between months 2 and 5 post-transplant.
In our Phase 2 trial, nearly every patient (26 of 27) who demonstrated chimerism at six months post-transplant was able to be completely weaned off all chronic immunosuppression by approximately twelve months post-transplant, and every patient (n = 26) who was weaned off all chronic immunosuppression at twelve months post-transplant has subsequently been able to stay off chronic immunosuppression, without organ rejection during their follow-up. As detailed below, two patients that remained off chronic immunosuppression died at years 3.5 and 4 post-transplant due to pneumococcal sepsis and lung cancer, respectively. We have followed these 26 patients for a median of 9.0 years, and the longest for 14.0 years since their transplant.
Induction of Durable Chimerism and Withdrawal of Immunosuppression
Of the 37 patients who received FCR001, 26 (70%) achieved durable donor chimerism (defined for purposes of the Phase 2 trial as whole blood or T-cell donor chimerism greater than 40% at six months post-transplant) and were successfully weaned from their chronic immunosuppression without developing acute rejection or donor specific antibodies. After mid-course optimizations to the Phase 2 protocol were implemented in late 2013, 14 of the last 17 patients (82%) in the trial achieved durable chimerism and could be withdrawn from chronic immunosuppression at approximately one year post-transplant.
During approximately the first half of the Phase 2 trial, we identified certain factors that may have contributed to the failure of the donor’s HSCs to durably engraft in some of our FCR001 recipients. These factors include suboptimal HSC/FC cell counts, failure to administer a post-transplant dose of cyclophosphamide per protocol, the presence of infection at the time of the transplant, a lack of adherence to best clinical practices for management of allo-HSCT patients, and a Panel Reactive Antibody (PRA) greater than 20%. A high PRA indicates that a patient has a disproportionate response to HLA antigens, and a PRA of greater than 20% (which is observed in approximately 10% of LDKT recipients) is a known risk factor for organ rejection in solid organ transplant. Based on these observations, we incorporated certain dosing and protocol refinements into our Phase 2 trial through late 2013. From that timepoint onward (denoted by the (2) in the figure above), 14 of the last 17 patients (82%) dosed in our trial achieved durable donor chimerism and were able to be weaned off their chronic immunosuppression without rejecting the transplanted organ. Based on two observed cases of GvHD in 2014 and 2015, each of which involved a female donor to unrelated male recipient (a known risk factor for GvHD in allo-HSCT), in October 2015 we further refined our Phase 2 protocol to exclude female donors to unrelated male recipients (denoted by the

(3) in the figure above). Once this protocol change was implemented, we did not observe any further cases of GvHD in the last seven patients in our Phase 2 trial who received FCR001.
Withdrawal of Chronic Immunosuppression Irrespective of HLA Mismatch
In our Phase 2 trial, the ability to discontinue chronic immunosuppression was observed across all levels of donor and recipient HLA matching, with 19 out of 26 recipients (73%) who were able to durably discontinue their chronic immunosuppression having an HLA match of three or less to their donor. We did not observe any correlation between the degree of HLA mismatch and any of durable chimerism, safety, or GvHD. We believe that the induction of durable allogeneic tolerance (as demonstrated by successful discontinuation of chronic immunosuppression) in a number of patients with poor HLA matching demonstrates FCR001’s potential to overcome a major obstacle in solid organ transplantation and allo-HSCT. The figure below summarizes the distribution of all 37 FCR001-dosed patients in terms of the degree of HLA matching in each of living related donors and living unrelated donors. Results were comparable across all degrees of HLA matching, and whether the donor was related or unrelated. Of patients who received very low-matched (zero to two HLA match) kidneys from unrelated donors, 12 of 17 were durably weaned off their chronic immunosuppression.
HLA Matching and Relatedness—Patient Status


Chimerism as Predictor of Ability to Withdraw Chronic Immunosuppression at One Year Post-Transplant
Hematopoietic chimerism has recently emerged as a promising, near-term, surrogate marker for predicting allogeneic tolerance induction. In our Phase 2 trial, we observed that high levels (>50%) of donor chimerism at three and six months post-transplant correlated strongly with the ability to discontinue chronic immunosuppression approximately one year after transplant, without subsequent graft rejection. Durable whole-blood and T-cell donor chimerism was observed in 27 patients, of whom 26 were successfully weaned from chronic immunosuppression at approximately one year, with one durably chimeric subject dying due to complications from GvHD shortly before the one-year time point.
All 26 patients in our Phase 2 trial who could be withdrawn from chronic immunosuppression at approximately one year post-transplant attained high and durable levels of whole blood chimerism and/or T-cell chimerism. Of these 26 patients, 22 developed very high level (>90%) donor whole blood chimerism beginning the first month post-transplant, and 24 out of 26 patients had >90% chimerism at one year post transplant. As of March 1, 2023, all 26 patients had retained durable chimerism for the duration of their follow-up.

As depicted in the graph below, the mean percentage whole blood and T-cell donor chimerism levels for FCR001-treated patients weaned off their chronic immunosuppression at approximately one year post-transplant reached approximately 95% as early as one month post-transplant and remained at this level for as long as ten years.

Values are mean +/- standard deviation.
N indicates the number of FCR001 treated patients weaned off IS at approximately one year post-transplant for whom % whole blood and T-cell donor chimerism were measured at that time point
We believe that these collective observations support our belief that the establishment of high levels of donor chimerism is an early and consistent predictor of the ability to durably withdraw an LDKT recipient from chronic immunosuppression without rejecting the transplanted organ.
Of the ten FCR001-dosed transplant recipients in our Phase 2 trial who did not achieve durable chimerism, eight were transiently chimeric and two never engrafted. Transiently chimeric patients typically lost donor chimerism within the first two to five months post-transplant.
While none of the 26 patients in our Phase 2 trial who developed durable chimerism experienced biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR), seven of the ten patients who did not achieve durable chimerism did develop BPAR. BPAR was successfully treated in five of these seven patients, but severe infections in two patients required them to be removed from all immunosuppression, which resulted in graft loss. This is consistent with how severe infections would be treated in a standard of care solid organ transplant setting. At the time of their BPAR episodes, all but one patient was being maintained on lower-than-normal levels of immunosuppression, which would have significantly increased the risk of BPAR. In four of these seven patients, immunosuppression therapy was lowered to monotherapy (tacrolimus in three cases and sirolimus in one case), at the investigator’s discretion, and/or lowered to a dose level below what would be permitted in our Phase 3 trial. Our Phase 3 protocol requires that standard of care immunosuppression therapy be maintained for all patients who do not maintain durable donor chimerism at and beyond month six post-transplant unless lowering of immunosuppression is otherwise determined to be medically necessary (e.g. due to a serious infection).
Overall Five-Year Kidney Graft Survival
As of March 1, 2023, five-year survival of the donated kidney was 34 out of 37 patients (92%) in our Phase 2 trial, compared to five-year kidney graft survival of 86% in patients tracked by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). The three cases of kidney graft loss in our Phase 2 trial occurred in patients who did not establish durable chimerism and were unable to discontinue chronic immunosuppression. As noted earlier, we revised our Phase 2 protocol (and maintained these revisions in our Phase 3 protocol) to address certain factors that we believe may have played a role in these three graft losses, including incorporating into our Phase 2

protocol best clinical practices for management of allo-HSCT patients to minimize infections and excluding patients with a history of infection.
Observation of Renal Function
As shown in the graph below, average renal function in our Phase 2 patients, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease, was observed to be preserved over time, both for the durably chimeric patients off chronic immunosuppression after approximately one year as well as for all FCR001 patients on an intent-to-treat basis (ITT). No abnormal histologic findings or instances of BPAR were observed on any protocol biopsies in durably chimeric patients off chronic immunosuppression.
Separately and apart from our Phase 2 trial protocol, the lead investigator at Northwestern Medical Center for our Phase 2 trial evaluated both longer-term kidney function and cardiovascular medication usage, as described further below, at up to five years post-transplant in FCR001-treated patients. These patients were compared to a cohort of standard of care LDKT patients who the investigator determined would have met all of our Phase 2 trial enrollment criteria and were transplanted at Northwestern between 2009 and 2012 (the first three years of our Phase 2 trial). In a retrospective analysis through year four post-transplant of these standard of care LDKT patients, mean eGFR of this cohort was observed to decline over time as depicted by the gray line in the graphic below.
Mean eGFR* Over Time Post-Transplant


*MDRD-4 (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) equation
Average renal function calculation excludes graft losses occurring prior to any given time point. Over time, sample size decreased due to 3 deaths, 3 graft losses, patients not yet out to the time point, or eGFR values missing. Note that ITT analysis excludes the five patients who were enrolled in the Phase 2 trial but did not actually receive FCR001.
Due to the retrospective nature of the analysis, which is not included in our database, data from the standard of care cohort (depicted by the gray line) does not include baseline eGFR data or year 5 data.
Cardiovascular Medication Usage
The evaluation of cardiovascular medication usage conducted by the lead investigator at Northwestern Medical Center for our Phase 2 trial as described above resulted in the findings summarized as follows. As shown in the table below, at four years post-transplant, cardiovascular medication usage of FCR001 patients who were durably chimeric and off chronic immunosuppression

compared favorably with that of the retrospectively gathered standard of care cohort of 132 transplant recipients who received their LDKT at the same site and during the same timeframe as the first half of our Phase 2 trial.

Evidence of Immunocompetence in FCR001-Treated Patients
One measure of successful immune system reconstitution is having a highly diverse repertoire of T cell receptor (TCR) clones, meaning a wide range of TCR clones, each capable of recognizing and targeting different foreign antigens. To examine TCR clone diversity in our LDKT patients, we randomly selected nine patients from our Phase 2 trial, of which five had achieved full chimerism and four did not, and analyzed blood samples 24 months after LDKT. We observed that, even though the clone diversity in TCR repertoire was somewhat reduced in all nine post-transplant recipients, the repertoire in these patients was diverse enough to suggest recovery of immune competence. As shown in the figure below, at least 97% and 95% of the total and top 1000 TCR clones, respectively, observed in a representative sample of these post-transplant recipients were not present in either donor or recipient pre-transplant. This suggests that a significant number of unique TCR clones (that were not previously present in either the donor or the recipient) were generated post-transplant, which is evidence of a competent immune system. Within the pool of shared sequences observed in the remaining 3% of clones, full chimerism correlated with a shift towards homology with the donor, meaning that the TCR clones were primarily derived from the donor HSCs, rather than from residual recipient HSCs, while loss of chimerism correlated more closely with the TCR clonal diversity in the recipient following autologous recovery of T-cells.
In another study, reported in Science Translational Medicine (2012), Dr. Ildstad and certain collaborators analyzed lineage reconstitution in the first eight recipients of FCR001 in our Phase 2 trial. In that study, Dr. Ildstad and certain collaborators observed evidence of reconstitution of immune and blood cell components (e.g. T-cells, B-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, granulocytes) in those FCR001 recipients. In addition, in a separate analysis reported in Transplantation (2015), Dr. Ildstad and certain collaborators analyzed blood reconstitution in the first 20 recipients of FCR001 in our Phase 2 trial (with follow up on the durably chimeric patients between eight and 48 months post-discontinuation of chronic immunosuppression). In five of the 12 patients who achieved durable chimerism, donor-derived red blood cell production was observed. We believe that these observations support the potential of our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy to address certain severe blood, immune or metabolic disorders that have previously been successfully treated with standard allo-HSCT.
Our Phase 2 Results—Safety

Through March 1, 2023, we have accumulated a total of approximately 316 patient-years of exposure to FCR001 in LDKT, and the safety profile observed in our patients was generally consistent with that expected if a patient were to separately receive both a standard kidney transplant and an allo-HSCT with nonmyeloablative conditioning. Moreover, as noted above, preliminary data indicates that patients who were able to be weaned off immunosuppression with FCR001 had preserved kidney function and third-party data suggests a markedly lower reliance on cardiovascular medications at four years post-transplant compared to traditional transplants with chronic immunosuppression over a similar time frame. Most adverse events occurred during the first 12 months post-transplant when the patients were on conventional immunosuppression, and no events of infusion toxicity following FCR001 administration were observed. We summarize the safety findings in greater detail below.
The most commonly reported adverse events were diarrhea, BK viruria/viremia, fever, cough, and nausea. The most commonly reported serious adverse events were fever, deep vein thrombosis, including among several patients who had predisposing factors such as central venous catheter placements or Factor V deficiency, diarrhea, pneumonia and febrile neutropenia. The most commonly reported infections were BK viruria/viremia, nasopharyngitis, cellulitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection. BK urine/blood were monitored frequently per protocol and no cases of BK nephropathy were observed. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia was also observed at a rate consistent with what would be expected in a kidney transplant and allogeneic stem cell transplant population. There was not an increase in CMV incidence in donor/recipient pairs at higher risk of CMV incidence or activation. There were two cases of tissue invasive CMV disease (colitis), both of which occurred in the two FCR001 patients that experienced GvHD.

Five-year patient survival in our Phase 2 trial is comparable to that of LDKT patients as reported in the UNOS database, being approximately 89% and 92%, respectively. Out of the 37 patients in our Phase 2 trial who received FCR001, there were four patient deaths. The first death, of a patient who had durable chimerism through month 11 post-transplant, occurred eleven months post-transplant and was attributed to complications arising from progressive, treatment-resistant, Grade III GvHD with recurrent CMV colitis. There was a meaningful delay between onset of symptoms and when this patient presented to the transplant center for evaluation and treatment. The second death, of a durably chimeric patient approximately four years after transplant and approximately three years after the patient had discontinued chronic immunosuppression, was attributed to non-small cell carcinoma of the lung. This patient, whose death was deemed not study related by the DSMB, had a more than 40-year history of heavy smoking and refused treatment for his cancer. The third death, of a durably chimeric patient approximately 3.5 years post-transplant and approximately 2.5 years after the patient had discontinued chronic immunosuppression, was attributed to pneumococcus sepsis and human metapneumovirus infection. This patient was non-compliant with the trial’s revaccination protocol (which is standard of care following allo-HSCT) and fell ill while traveling abroad. The fourth death, of a patient who did not achieve durable chimerism, occurred 4.5 years post-transplant and was attributed to respiratory failure secondary to septic shock and aspiration pneumonia. The DSMB deemed this death not study related.
 There were two cases of GvHD, both in the setting of a female donor to an unrelated male recipient. This donor/recipient combination is known to have a higher risk of GvHD in allo-HSCT. The first case of GvHD occurred at 135 days post-transplantation and was fatal, as described above. The HLA match between this recipient and his donor was two out of six. The second case (Grade II acute GvHD) occurred at approximately two months post-transplant, almost immediately after the patient’s immunosuppression medication was changed from tacrolimus to sirolimus due to tacrolimus-induced toxicity. The patient’s acute GvHD resolved following treatment with corticosteroids. This patient was weaned off chronic immunosuppression and subsequently developed Grade I-II ocular/musculoskeletal chronic GvHD, which is currently well-managed. The HLA match between this recipient and his donor was one out of six. There were no other reports of acute or chronic GvHD. While other female-donor-to-unrelated-male-recipient pairs in our Phase 2 trial did not experience GvHD, we nonetheless excluded female donor to unrelated male recipients from the last seven patients in our Phase 2 trial, and no further instances of GvHD were observed.
Six patients in our Phase 2 trial were diagnosed with skin cancers (squamous cell and basal cell), all of which were successfully treated. Skin cancers account for 40% to 50% of malignancies in solid organ transplant, and solid organ transplant recipients are 65- to 250-fold more likely to develop squamous cell cancers and ten- to 16-fold more likely to develop basal cell skin cancers compared to the general population. One patient who was not durably chimeric and remained on chronic immunosuppression developed acute lymphocytic leukemia approximately seven years post-transplant and is in remission following chemotherapy. Approximately six years after transplant, this patient had received rituximab to treat an episode of acute, antibody-mediated rejection approximately nine months before this diagnosis. One patient was diagnosed approximately seventeen months post-transplant with papillary thyroid carcinoma, which was successfully surgically removed, and, as described above, one patient, a lifelong smoker, was diagnosed 4.5 years post-transplant with non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, which was ultimately fatal.
Adverse events reported by stem cell donors consisted of headache, fatigue, skeletal muscular pain, and nausea, and occurred around the timing of their granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration for stem cell mobilization and apheresis. These adverse events were generally mild, fairly transient, and responded to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or similar pain medications. There were no serious adverse events reported by any stem cell donors.
Our Phase 2 Results—Quality of Life (QoL)
Several clinical and real-world studies highlight that treatment with chronic immunosuppression significantly impairs patient-reported QoL in solid organ transplant recipients. To study the potential influence of withdrawal from chronic immunosuppression on transplant recipients’ patient-reported QoL, 13 FCR001-treated patients from our Phase 2 LDKT trial who were successfully withdrawn from chronic immunosuppression at approximately one year post-transplant were compared with 12 patients who would have met inclusion criteria for the FCR001 tolerance protocol but were transplanted under standard of care therapy. Patients were administered three validated QoL self-administered questionnaires: the End Stage Renal Disease Symptom Checklist—Transplantation Module (ESRD-TM); the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, the most frequently used patient reported outcomes instrument in clinical trials today; and the EuroQol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Investigators and statisticians were blinded to the treatment group. The patient demographics were similar between the two groups. FCR001-treated patients and the standard of care patients were surveyed an average of 50 and 75 months after their organ transplant, respectively.
In general, FCR001 treated patients reported better QoL than standard of care treated patients in all dimensions. In the ESRD-TM, standard of care patients reported statistically significantly greater cardiac and renal dysfunction and significantly greater levels of side effects from corticosteroids than FCR001 patients. The General Health Component of the SF-36 showed a statistically significant decrease in self-reported health among the standard of care patients compared to the FCR001 patients. In the EQ-5D-5L, standard of care patients reported a statistically significantly higher rate of pain and discomfort problems than FCR001 patients. A number of other categories in each of the three questionnaires showed positive trends in favor of FCR001 patients, but the findings were not statistically

significant due to the small sample size. In addition to the dimensions of the SF-36 and ESRD-TM where FCR001 treated patients had a statistically significant benefit versus standard of care, patients treated with FCR001 had numerically favorable ratings on all other dimensions that did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, on the EQ-5D5L, in addition to the statistically significant benefit on pain/discomfort ratings, FCR001 treated patients had numerically favorable ratings versus standard of care on the dimensions of usual activity, anxiety/depression, and mobility. Both FCR001 and standard of care treated patients rated no problems on the dimension of self-care.
In summary, the three quality of life instruments used in this trial were in agreement that standard of care patients reported diminished mental health in the form of greater psychological stress, decreased overall mental health, and greater anxiety/depression scores compared to the FCR001-treated patients who had been able to discontinue their chronic immunosuppression. The three instruments also provided similar results in the areas of reported pain and discomfort as well as cognitive impairment, which again were notably higher in the standard of care patients compared to the FCR001-treated patients. Collectively, these preliminary results suggest that when our investigational FCR001 therapy enabled the discontinuation of all chronic immunosuppression medications, this outcome may be associated with significantly improved QoL in those FCR001-treated patients as compared to the QoL of standard of care patients who remained on chronic immunosuppression. Our FREEDOM-1 trial will further evaluate the potential QoL impact of FCR001 versus standard of care using the ESRD-TM and SF-36 questionnaires.
Our Phase 3 FREEDOM-1 Trial
Based on promising data from our Phase 2 LDKT trial, we initiated FREEDOM-1, a 5-year multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled, Phase 3 trial assessing the safety and efficacy of FCR001 in first-time, adult LDKT. We expected the trial to take place across 18 to 20 sites in the United States, of which 18 were activated as of the February 2023 announcement to terminate the clinical trial. A total of 120 LDKT recipients were to be randomized 2-to-1 into the following two arms: (1) the interventional arm, where 80 patients would receive LDKT and FCR001 accompanied by nonmyeloablative conditioning, and receive standard of care chronic immunosuppression that can potentially be eliminated by 12 months post-transplant, and (2) the control arm, where 40 patients wouldreceive a LDKT plus standard of care chronic immunosuppression. The primary objective was to evaluate the proportion of FCR001 recipients who are free from chronic immunosuppression, without BPAR, at 24 months post-transplant. The secondary objective was to evaluate the change in mean renal function (eGFR by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) from month one post-transplant to month 24 in FCR001 recipients. Because LDKT recipients on standard of care treatments do not discontinue immunosuppression without rejecting the transplanted organ, neither the primary endpoint nor the secondary endpoint of FREEDOM-1 involves a statistical comparison between the interventional arm and the control arm. Instead, the primary endpoint of FREEDOM-1 was the demonstration that the lower end of our confidence interval of FCR001 patients free from chronic immunosuppression and without BPAR at two years post-transplant is above 30%. The secondary endpoint of FREEDOM-1 was the demonstration that the lower end of our confidence interval for the mean renal function (as measured by eGFR) of the FCR001 patients is above a five-point decline in eGFR.
In February 2023, we announced that we had decided to discontinue our FREEDOM-1 clinical trial evaluating FCR001’s ability to induce durable tolerance in LDKT recipients. This decision was primarily attributable to the pace of enrollment and the associated timeline to critical milestones in those programs.
 Our Preliminary Interim Phase 3 FREEDOM-1 Trial Results

In November 2021, in connection with long-term Phase 2 follow-up data presented at the 2021 American Society of Nephrology meeting, we also announced preliminary data from the first patients dosed in our FREEDOM-1 Phase 3 clinical trial. At the data cutoff date, all patients treated at least three months prior to the cutoff date with our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy, FCR001, achieved T-cell chimerism levels greater than 50% at each of the 3-, 6-, and 12-month timepoints post-transplant. In our Phase 2 study, establishment and maintenance of greater than 50% donor peripheral T-cell chimerism in an LDKT recipient at 3, 6 and 12 months after administration of FCR001 all correlated strongly with the patient’s ability to durably discontinue chronic IS approximately one year after transplant, without subsequent graft rejection. We believe this preliminary data supports continuation of the Phase 3 clinical trial and further development of FCR001 for additional therapeutic indications.
In June 2022, we provided further updates on patients dosed in the FREEDOM-1 trial, announcing that a total of 7 patients had been dosed and all patients dosed at least three months prior to the cutoff date had achieved and maintained T-cell chimerism levels >50% at each of the 3-, 6- and 12-month timepoints post-transplant. All 3 of the patients dosed more than 12 months prior to the data cutoff date have been successfully weaned off all chronic anti-rejection drugs. The longest at that time had been followed for 24 months post-transplant. We also reported three cases of low-grade (grade II) aGvHD. One of these patients is more than 12 months post-transplant and, notwithstanding their treatment-responsive aGvHD, has been weaned off all anti-rejection drugs. One of the three aGvHD patients was subsequently diagnosed with moderate chronic GvHD and at that time was responding to treatment. No trial stopping rules were triggered by the GvHD cases, and trial screening and enrollment continued. However, to investigate these aGvHD cases, Talaris

conducted an internal review of all GvHD cases in Phase 2 and 3. This review prompted implementation of an amendment to the trial protocol. We reported that the incidence of GvHD in FCR001 subjects was correlated with high CD34+ cell counts and high total nucleated cell counts in the FCR001 product. We also noted a correlation between the use of plerixafor as a donor mobilizing agent and an increased risk of GvHD, as plerixafor significantly increased CD34+ and total nucleated cell counts in the FCR001 product. At that time, we introduced two risk mitigation measures for GvHD in the amended trial protocol: (1) elimination of plerixafor as a donor mobilizing agent, and (2) addition of a second post-transplant dose of cyclophosphamide, which has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of severe GvHD in haplo-identical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants. 

As shown in the figure below, a total of seven patients had been dosed through the June 2022 data cutoff date, three of whom were more than 12 months post-transplant. All demonstrated >50% T-cell chimerism at each of the 3-, 6- and 12-month timepoints and had been discontinued from chronic IS. One patient was more than six months post-transplant, one patient was more than three months post-transplant, and had demonstrated >50% T-cell chimerism at the 3- and 6-month timepoints, respectively. The remaining patient had not yet met the 3-month timepoint at the data cut-off date. Additionally, the overall safety profile of Phase 3 patients at the time was consistent with that observed in our Phase 2 study of FCR001.



In October 2022, we received a report of a patient death, which triggered a pre-specified, temporary stopping requirement and review by the DMC. After their review of this case, the DMC determined that trial enrollment and dosing may continue. We reported this event and the DMC’s recommendation to the FDA. The patient had been hospitalized with grade IV GvHD that was complicated by serious infections leading to respiratory and renal failure, and ultimately death. We also reported that, as of October 2022, the other two FREEDOM-1 patients who were previously reported to have had grade II aGvHD have since experienced complete resolution of their aGvHD symptoms, although one patient experienced additional flares that were also responsive to treatment. After reviewing the data, the DMC concluded that the FREEDOM-1 protocol modifications implemented in June 2022 should be sufficient to mitigate the risk of GvHD going forward, and recommended continuation of the trial without further modifications. Despite this recommendation, trial enrollment remained below expectations, and we ultimately terminated our clinical trials in LDKT.
 Delayed Tolerance in LDKT: FREEDOM-2
In our FREEDOM-2 trial, we had been assessing whether FCR001 can induce durable immune tolerance to the transplanted organ when it is administered, together with nonmyeloablative conditioning to LDKT recipients up to one year following their kidney transplant. In May 2022, we announced that the Company had activated its second trial site for our FREEDOM-2 clinical trial. In February 2023, we announced that we had decided to discontinue our FREEDOM-2 clinical trial evaluating FCR001’s ability to induce durable tolerance in LDKT recipients. This decision was primarily attributable to the pace of enrollment and the associated timeline to critical milestones in those programs.
 Restore: Severe Autoimmune Disease
We believe that our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy has the potential to restore self-tolerance in patients suffering from severe autoimmune diseases by eradicating diseased autoreactive cells and regenerating a new and healthy repertoire of immune cells, thereby halting the autoreactive cells’ attack on one’s own body.
We believe that our Phase 2 LDKT trial has already provided some proof of concept that our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy could be used to treat severe autoimmune disease. Typically, 20% to 60% of kidney transplant patients whose end-stage renal disease is caused by a kidney-related autoimmune disease experience post-transplant recurrence of their kidney-related autoimmune disorder. Ten patients in our Phase 2 trial of FCR001 had an underlying, kidney-related autoimmune disease that led to their need for a LDKT. As shown in the table below, seven of these ten patients achieved durable donor chimerism and were able to be weaned off all chronic immunosuppression approximately one year post-transplant. As of March 1, 2023, none of these seven successfully tolerized patients

has experienced recurrence of their prior kidney-related autoimmune disorder, with follow-up from four to ten years post-transplant. By contrast, recurrence of the prior kidney-related autoimmune disease was reported in two of the three other patients who experienced either transient or no chimerism.
Durable Chimerism vis-à-vis Disease Recurrence in our Phase 2 Trial


 | Durable Chimerism | Disease Recurrence
Condition | DurableChimerism | DiseaseRecurrence | Transientor noChimerism | DiseaseRecurrence
IGA Nephropathy | 4 | 0 | 2 | 
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis | | 0 | 0 | 
Membranous Glomerulonephritis | | | | 1 
Total | 7 | 0 | 3 | 2 

 
We believe that this preliminary finding highlights the importance of achieving durable chimerism in order to induce durable allogeneic tolerance, as well as the potential of FCR001 to induce durable allogeneic tolerance in patients with an autoimmune disease.
Over the past 25 years, data from randomized trials and real-world experience gathered from more than 3,300 patients by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Autoimmune Disease Working Party has shown that individuals suffering from a range of severe, refractory forms of rheumatologic, neurologic, and hematological autoimmune diseases appear to have benefitted from HSCT, primarily autologous HSCT. We believe that those data, together with our preliminary findings showing the potential of FCR001 to induce allogeneic tolerance in patients with a prior kidney-related autoimmune disease, support development of FCR001 for severe autoimmune disease. We initially have prioritized development of FCR001 in a severe form of scleroderma, also known as systemic sclerosis (SSc), given the high unmet need in this indication and third party data supporting the potential benefit of HSCT for SSc.
Background of Scleroderma or SSc
SSc is a rare, clinically heterogenous, progressive, multisystem, chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the connective tissues. It has a prevalence of approximately 70,000 to 80,000 individuals in the United States, about 80% of whom are women aged 30 to 50. SSc is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs, vasculopathy, and the presence of autoantibodies against various cellular antigens. The etiology of this disorder is largely unknown, but research suggests it is due to both genetic and environmental factors that lead to dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune systems, dysfunctional inflammatory responses, and connective tissue repair injury in susceptible individuals.
We estimate that approximately 40% of systemic sclerosis patients are diagnosed with the most severe form of SSc, diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). dcSSc has a poor prognosis, with a disease-related mortality of 5% to 10% per year. dcSSc may progress rapidly, affecting areas throughout the body. Progression from Raynaud’s phenomenon—a condition that causes decreased blood flow to the fingers and toes—to skin thickening typically occurs within one year and can cause profound impairments to quality of life and morbidities, including disfigurement, difficulty opening the mouth, loss of facial expression, and joint contractures. Internal organ vasculopathy and fibrosis typically begin within five years of diagnosis. Commonly affected organs can include the gastrointestinal tract, heart, lungs and kidneys. Interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension together account for nearly 50% of SSc deaths, followed by renal and cardiac complications.
The mortality rate in dcSSc is highest during the first five years of disease onset, when disease progression is most rapid. Patients with rapidly progressing dcSSc have an especially poor prognosis, with survival rates at five and ten years as low as 60% and 30%, respectively. There are no disease modifying therapies for dcSSc. Nintedanib and tocilizumab are the only FDA-approved therapies indicated for SSc but are only labeled to address interstitial lung disease in these patients. Other treatment options are only focused on symptom management and their costs can be substantial, especially in patients with advanced disease. A study published prior to the introduction of nintedanib—which costs nearly $140,000 annually—estimated that five-year direct healthcare costs in the United States for SSc patients with interstitial lung disease or pulmonary hypertension exceed $190,000 and $250,000, respectively.
Recently, however, HSCT has emerged as a promising and potentially disease-modifying treatment for patients with dcSSc at risk for organ failure.

HSCT as Potential Treatment for dcSSc
SSc is thought to be mediated by autoreactive T-cells and B-cells targeting self-antigens, eventually leading to organ damage. HSCT aims to reconstitute the hematopoietic system using either the patient’s own (autologous) or healthy donor (allogeneic) stem cells to re-establish a naïve, self-tolerant immune system to both allo-antigens and auto-antigens. The combination of lymphotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin) with or without TBI leads to a profound and long-lasting lymphopenia with persistently reduced levels of pathogenic autoantibodies. Aside from this nonspecific immunosuppression, there is growing evidence that HSCT can restore tolerance by establishing a diversified T-cell receptor repertoire and by increasing numbers of regulatory T-cells.
Autologous HSCT is increasingly being explored as a treatment option for patients with dcSSc and internal organ involvement. Cumulative data from three randomized, controlled trials conducted by third parties have observed the benefit of autologous HSCT therapy in dcSSc as assessed by multiple important outcome measures including clinical improvement, overall and event-free survival, and disease relapse. Further, based on these findings, the European League Against Rheumatism and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation both now recommend HSCT for patients with rapidly progressive dcSSc at risk for organ failure. Data to date indicate that autologous HSCT may require a myeloablative regimen to be most effective. Higher rates of relapse have been observed when less intensive conditioning regimens have been used. Nevertheless, disease recurrence still was observed in autologous HSCT patients, presumably in part because the patient’s own diseased stem cells are being reinfused in the patient.
Allogeneic HSCT offers a promising alternative therapy to autologous HSCT for patients diagnosed with dcSSc. The advantage of allo-HSCT is its ability to replace the immune system with cells from healthy donors that lack the genetic predisposition for a return to autoimmunity, and with the potential of inducing tolerance to both auto-antigens and allo-antigens. Despite these benefits, allo-HSCT is not commonly used to treat dcSSc patients due to concerns over a potentially higher risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and GvHD, which affects between 20% to 70% of recipients. The risk of TRM and GvHD depends on the type of transplant, the degree of donor-recipient HLA compatibility, and the prophylaxis regimen.
Compared to autologous HSCT, standard allo-HSCT has the potential to offer patients with dcSSc additional benefit of lower rates of disease recurrence or potentially a cure. However, with current approaches, this procedure is accompanied by the significant risk of acute and chronic GvHD and a higher TRM. We believe that our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy, which combines administration of FCR001 with a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen, could offer a less toxic alternative to autologous HSCT (which generally requires a fully myeloablative conditioning regimen), and has the potential to enable broader use of allo-HSCT with a lower risk of severe GvHD for patients with dcSSc and potentially other severe autoimmune diseases.
Our Phase 2 Trial in dcSSc: FREEDOM-3
FREEDOM-3 is a two-year treatment and three-year follow-up, multi-center, single-arm, open-label proof-of-concept Phase 2 trial assessing the safety and efficacy of FCR001 in adults with dcSSc at risk for organ failure. The design of the FREEDOM-3 trial is substantially similar to that of the FREEDOM-2 trial, except without the kidney transplant. We plan to enroll up to 18 adults diagnosed with dcSSc within five years of first non-Raynaud’s symptom, who have not adequately responded to at least one immunosuppressive agent and have significant cutaneous and pulmonary and/or renal involvement. In order to minimize any safety risks of allo-HSCT in this new disease indication, investigators are seeking HLA-matched recipient-donor pairs for the first subjects in the trial. The primary endpoint in this trial will be safety assessed by AE/SAEs, GvHD, AEs of special interest, neutrophil and platelet recovery time, safety lab assessments, autologous rescue infusion use and donor-specific antibodies. Secondary and exploratory endpoints will include T-cell chimerism over time, overall event-free survival and various efficacy markers (e.g., CRISS, a relatively new composite response index for dcSSc which has recently been validated in later stage clinical studies; DMARD use; and skin manifestation changes by Modified Rodnan skin score). We initiated this trial in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by the rapid evolution of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We believe that our approach, strategy, scientific capabilities, know-how and experience provide us with competitive advantages. However, we expect substantial competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaborations, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring

technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
Scleroderma and Severe Autoimmune Diseases
There are currently no FDA- or EMA-approved cell therapies for treating scleroderma. Current treatment options are focused on addressing organ or tissue-specific manifestations. Methotrexate is often prescribed for skin or musculoskeletal complications, proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers for gastrointestinal reflux, and endothelin receptor antagonists, epoprostenol analogues or PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary artery hypertension. Boehringer Ingelheim’s nindetanib and Roche’s tocilizumab are the only FDA-approved therapies indicated for the treatment of SSc-associated interstitial lung disease. In addition, other companies, such as Acceleron Pharma, Inc., are exploring therapeutics for SSc, and others, such as Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Horizon Therapeutics, Plc., and Kadmon Holdings, Inc., are exploring therapeutics for dcSSc; however, these agents are not intended to be curative. Although not formally approved by FDA for this indication, autologous HSCT is occasionally used as a therapy for severe scleroderma and is reimbursed by some payors in the United States and Europe. In the future, we may pursue the development of FCR001 or another cell therapy as a treatment for other severe autoimmune diseases, and as a result, we may also face competition more broadly from other companies with approved products or product candidates in development.
Our Licenses and Collaborations
 License Agreement with University of Louisville Research Foundation, Inc.
In October 2018, we entered into an amended and restated exclusive license agreement (ULRF License Agreement) with University of Louisville Research Foundation, Inc. (ULRF) as an agent of the University of Louisville, relating to certain licensed patent rights and know-how related to human facilitating cells for our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy. Pursuant to the ULRF License Agreement, ULRF granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under such patents and a nonexclusive royalty-bearing, worldwide license for such know-how to research, develop, commercialize and manufacture FCR001 and products containing FCR001 in all fields, without limitation. ULRF also granted us the right to grant sublicenses in accordance with the ULRF License Agreement.
ULRF retained (i) the rights to publish the licensed technology, subject to our prior written approval and in accordance with the reciprocal nondisclosure agreement governing confidential information relating to the ULRF License Agreement, and (ii) the rights to practice the licensed patents and use the licensed technology, in each case solely for not-for-profit educational and non-commercial research purposes. The ULRF License Agreement is also subject to pre-existing rights of the U.S. government.
Pursuant to the terms of the ULRF License Agreement, we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the products with the goal of achieving regulatory approval thereof and, following such approval, to commercialize such product in any country or countries for which such regulatory approval has been obtained.
As partial consideration for the license and rights, we have paid and will continue to pay ULRF a non-refundable, non-creditable annual license maintenance fee starting on the third anniversary date of the agreement through the seventeenth anniversary date. In addition, we are obligated to pay ULRF non-refundable, non-creditable research and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain milestone events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.625 million for development, regulatory and sales milestones. Each milestone is payable only once. One milestone has been achieved to date under the ULRF License Agreement. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid ULRF $125,000 in milestone payments and $150,000 in annual maintenance fees, for a total of $275,000.
As partial consideration for the license and rights, we also granted to ULRF 65,186 shares of contingent equity consideration. On or prior to an initial public offering or deemed liquidation event, we will either issue shares of common stock equal to such consideration or make an equivalent cash payment of such share amount multiplied by the price per share of common stock at the time of the initial public offering or deemed liquidation event, in full satisfaction of the contingent equity consideration owed to ULRF pursuant to the ULRF License Agreement. If we grant stock to ULRF pursuant to the ULRF License Agreement, then ULRF has agreed to enter into a lockup agreement for such duration and in the form requested by the underwriters of the initial public offering in the same manner as our directors, executive officers and certain stockholders. Dr. Ildstad is entitled to a portion of this compensation pursuant to investor rights under the University of Louisville’s Intellectual Property Policy.
Furthermore, on a licensed product-by-licensed product, indication-by-indication and country-by-country basis, we are required to pay future tiered royalties ranging from 1.5% to 4% on annual aggregate net sales of all products during the term of the ULRF License Agreement, subject to certain reductions in connection with obtaining a license for any patents owned or controlled by a third party in order to commercialize the licensed product; provided, however, that the royalties due to ULRF shall not be reduced by more than fifty

percent (50%). In the event that we sublicense the licensed patent rights, ULRF is also entitled to receive a tiered percentage of the non-royalty sublicensing revenue we receive. The Company’s obligation to pay royalties continues until the expiration or abandonment of the last valid claim of any of the licensed patents under the ULRF License Agreement.
ULRF may terminate the ULRF License Agreement upon our material breach or bankruptcy. We may also terminate ULRF License Agreement upon prior written notice. Unless earlier terminated, the ULRF License Agreement will continue until the expiration or abandonment of the last valid claim of any of the licensed patents under the ULRF License Agreement.
Intellectual Property
The intellectual property that is available to us is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent protection in the United States and internationally for our proprietary technology, improvements, platforms, products and components thereof, novel biological discoveries, new therapeutic approaches and potential indications, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, generally we initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter, methods of production, and methods of use. Throughout the development of our product, we will seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through methods of clinical production and quality control.
As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio includes four patent families, which are exclusively in-licensed from ULRF in our field. These families include issued patents and pending applications related generally to our facilitating cell product, methods of making our facilitating cell product, methods of using our facilitating cell product therapeutically, and methods of evaluating the viability or potency of our facilitating cell product. Specifically, we have exclusively in-licensed a patent portfolio that currently includes at least three issued U.S. patents, 31 patents issued in foreign jurisdictions, and 10 patent applications pending worldwide. The issued patents from three of the four families in our portfolio are expected to expire around 2029, and any patents that issue from the fourth family in our portfolio are expected to expire around 2038, absent any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The first family includes issued patents in Australia, Canada, and Europe; there are no pending applications in this family. All of the issued claims in this family are directed to compositions that include at least 30% facilitating cells, methods of making such compositions, and/or methods of using such compositions. The European patent is validated in five European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom. This family of patents is in-licensed under an exclusive license agreement with ULRF, and is expected to expire in 2029, absent any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions.
The second family includes one issued U.S. patent, with claims directed to methods of increasing the number of facilitating cells by exposing them to the DOCK-2 protein. This patent is in-licensed under the same exclusive license agreement with ULRF, and is expected to expire in 2032, absent any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions.
The third family includes two issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. application, at least one issued patent in each of Australia, China, Europe, India, and Japan, and a pending application in Canada. The claims in this family are directed to compositions that include at facilitating cells, methods of making such compositions, and/or methods of using such compositions absent a requirement for any particular amount of facilitating cells. The European patent is validated in 17 European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, and also is validated in Hong Kong. This family of patents is in-licensed under the same exclusive license agreement with ULRF. The U.S. members of this family claim the benefit of priority to members of the first family (i.e., as a Continuation-in-Part), and are expected to expire in 2029, while the non-U.S. members of this family are expected to expire in 2031, absent any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions.
The fourth family includes pending applications in the U.S., Australia, Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan and Russia. These pending applications generally have claims directed to determining the potency of a composition that includes facilitating cells. This family of patents is co-owned by us and ULRF; this family of patents also falls within the same exclusive license agreement with ULRF. Patents that issue in this family are expected to expire in 2038, absent any applicable patent term adjustments or extensions.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the U.S., the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the term of a patent may be lengthened by patent term adjustment (PTA), which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in examining and granting a patent or the term of a patent may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension (PTE) after FDA approval for a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, subject to certain limitations and provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. PTE can be for no more than five years, typically only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from

approval, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. In addition, the length of the adjustment or extension granted could be less than that requested, and we may not receive the full PTA or PTE available if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fails to apply within applicable deadlines, fails to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise fails to satisfy applicable requirements.
As with many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our products will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those patent claims. However, our owned and in-licensed pending patent applications, and any patent applications that may be filed in the future or licensed from third parties, may not result in issuance. The breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents also cannot be predicted. Any of our issued patents or patents obtained in the future may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a therapeutic product that may be developed, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
In addition to patents, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We take measures to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information in order to protect aspects of the business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. It is our policy to require employees, consultants, outside scientific partners, sponsored researchers and other advisors (non-Talaris individuals) to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to non-Talaris individuals during the course of the relationship between us and non-Talaris individuals is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements we maintain with employees and consultants also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee or consultant in the course of employment or consulting relationships with us, or from the employee’s or consultant’s use of our confidential information, are our exclusive property and require such employees and consultants to assign their right, title and interest in such inventions to us. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through such contractual means with employees and consultants, we cannot guarantee that we have executed such agreements with all applicable counterparties, such agreements will not be breached, or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary rights. For more information, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
We have filed and obtained U.S. Registration No. 6180755 for the TALARIS THERAPEUTICS character mark for “biological preparations in the nature of allogeneic cell therapies for use in treating organ transplant patients” in International Class 5 and “providing laboratory services to hospitals and transplant centers involving manipulation of allogeneic cells used for cell therapy treatment of organ transplant patients” in International Class 42. We plan to register trademarks in connection with future products.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing strategy is designed to meet the high quality and demand needs of clinical supply and commercial launch of any approved product, while also pursuing the goal of carefully managing our cost structure, maximizing optionality, and optimizing long-term cost of goods. Execution of our strategy includes the following three major features:
•In-House Manufacturing Facility: All finished product development and manufacturing is performed in-house in our GMP Cell Processing Facility, which we believe has sufficient capacity for all contemplated clinical trials. 
 •Reliable Processing: Our one-day manufacturing process is robust, reliable and has remained substantially unchanged from Phase 2 to Phase 3, and we believe it is sufficiently scalable to meet future commercial needs without substantial modification. 
 •Robust Analytical Testing: We have developed and qualified in-process assays to support our process, and potency assays required to for the timely release of our product. 
 In February 2023, after terminating our clinical trials in LDKT, we also announced a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing stockholder value, including but not limited to, an acquisition, merger, possible business combinations and/or a divestiture of the Company's cell therapy CMC capabilities. There can be no assurance that divestiture of our cell therapy CMC capabilities, facilities, technical knowledge or personnel, will be successfully consummated.


Manufacturing Facility
We believe that operating our own manufacturing facility provides us with enhanced control of material supply and enables the more rapid implementation of process enhancements. We believe this approach positions us to support our multicenter clinical trials and potential future commercialization. Our GMP Cell Processing Facility is located in Louisville, Kentucky. The overall facility is approximately 20,000 square feet and includes two identical cleanroom GMP manufacturing suites, two identical quality control testing labs, gowning, changing and supply rooms, clean corridor, material warehouse, accessioning/ shipping rooms, freezer room and other support spaces.
Manufacturing Process and Analytical Testing
The manufacture of FCR001 involves complex processes, including detailed in-process analysis of cell types required for custom patient dosing, separation of the appropriate cells from the starting material with fast and efficient processing to maintain viability, and controlled cryopreservation designed to allow stable product storage until use. Our FCR001 process was substantially unchanged from Phase 2 to Phase 3, and we have manufactured and released multiple lots of clinical trial material for our trials.
The manufacturing process takes one day and does not require the costly and difficult cell expansion or genetic manipulation necessary for gene therapy and CAR-T manufacturing. The starting material, donated mobilized apheresed peripheral blood, is shipped to our GMP Cell Processing Facility and brought to the accessioning room, where it is inspected and received into the system, and then transported to one of the two dedicated manufacturing suites. Detailed analysis of the incoming apheresis product is performed during initial processing to precisely determine the HSC, FC, and ßTCR+ T-cell content, in order to set the requirements for downstream processing. The manufacturing process is carried out on semi-automated systems which use pre-sterilized, single-use, disposable kits. In order to meet the prescribed dose, our process removes a calculated amount of ßTCR+ T-cells and relatively enriches the product for HSCs and FCs. Samples of the product are then transported to the adjacent dedicated quality control lab for release testing. The final product is cryopreserved in a controlled rate freezer and stored in liquid nitrogen freezers. After testing for all finished product specifications and review of GMP requirements, the product is released by our in-house quality unit, and is later shipped in liquid nitrogen dry shippers to the transplant center, where it is stored until the transplant date.
Government Regulation
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (FD&C Act), the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, quality control, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, marketing, promotion, advertising, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting involving biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
U.S. Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices (GLPs) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an application for an investigational new drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval of the protocol and related documentation by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each study may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (GCPs) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA) for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); 


•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices (CGTPs) for human cellular and tissue products; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; 
 •review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, resulting in the licensure of the biological product for commercial marketing. 
 Before testing any biological product candidate, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, an IND must be submitted to the FDA and the FDA must allow the IND to proceed. An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA allowance that such investigational product may be administered to humans in connection with such trial. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA allowance to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators which generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur.
An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee (DSMB). This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study.
Certain information about certain clinical trials must also be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its clinicaltrials.gov website.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2. The investigational product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These 


clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling.
In some cases, FDA may require, or firms may voluntary pursue, post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor’s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP and as applicable CGTP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure its continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Where applicable, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the CGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human patient. The primary intent of the CGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through appropriate screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, CGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings precautions or interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase IV post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.

A designated orphan drug many not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or, as noted above, if the second applicant demonstrates that its product is clinically superior to the approved product with orphan exclusivity or the manufacturer of the approved product is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Orphan drug designation may also entitle a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a fast track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review.
Under the FDA’s breakthrough therapy program, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation comes with all of the benefits of fast track designation, which means that the sponsor may file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis if certain conditions are satisfied, including an agreement with the FDA on the proposed schedule for submission of portions of the application and the payment of applicable user fees before the FDA may initiate a review. The FDA may take other actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including holding meetings with the sponsor and providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development program.
A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA generally requires that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit, and under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA may require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.
RMAT Designation
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, Congress created the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, a product candidate that meets the

following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. A sponsor may request that the FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. The FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may, as appropriate, fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like some of FDA’s other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process.
Post-Approval Requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements, as well as requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. We currently rely, and may continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. After a BLA is approved for a biological product, the product also may be subject to official lot release. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
Manufacturers also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detentions or refusal to permit the import or export of the product, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products, and those supplying products, ingredients, and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
In addition to exclusivity under the BPCIA, a biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
Additional Regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and Other Laws
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits companies and their employees, agents, and intermediaries from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or secure any improper advantage, or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize, directly or indirectly, the payment of anything of value to any employee or official of a foreign government or public international organization, or political party, political party official, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence the recipient working in an official capacity. The scope of the FCPA

also includes employees and officials of state- owned or controlled enterprises, which may include healthcare professionals in many countries.
Equivalent laws have been adopted in other non-U.S. countries that impose similar obligations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act). As with the FCPA, these laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper or prohibited payments, or anything else of value, to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. The Bribery Act also imposes liability for failing to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense.
There also are other laws and regulations governing international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as trade control laws.
Failure to comply with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and trade control laws could subject us to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, where applicable.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and individual U.S. attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute; 
 •the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery; 
 •the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program; 
 •HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services 


relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 •the federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made during the previous year to certain non-physician providers, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives; 
 •federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and 
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 In addition to the above, on November 20, 2020, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) finalized further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. The effective date of the new safe harbors has been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, these rules will have on our business.
Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers, are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The

approval and commercialization of any of our other cell therapies outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business.
The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain a robust system to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial cost.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual, nondeductible fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; imposed a new federal excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices; expanded healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability; expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the PHS Act’s pharmaceutical pricing program, also known as the 340B Drug Pricing Program; created new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act; created a new requirement to annually report the identity and quantity of drug samples that manufacturers and authorized distributors of record provide to physicians; created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established the Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
There have been executive, legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. During his presidency, former President Trump signed several executive orders and numerous other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. For example, on January 22, 2018, former President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain Affordable Care Act-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices; however, on December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA), among other things, amends the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act), included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full Affordable Care Act. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Further, President

Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which began February 15, 2021 and remained open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. The Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent legislation, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress that include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers will be further reduced starting in 2025 absent further legislation. The U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws and regulations may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the former Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives.
For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, former President Trump signed several Executive Orders aimed at lowering drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. In response, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20 2020 CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation (MFN) Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021, CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nation rule. Additionally, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed, and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. This deadline was pushed back further to January 1, 2027 by the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and could potentially be pushed back to January 1, 2032 by the Inflation Reduction Act. Further, on December 31, 2020, CMS published a new rule, effective January 1, 2023, requiring manufacturers to ensure the full value of co-pay assistance is passed on to the patient or these dollars will count toward the Average Manufacturer Price and Best Price calculation of the drug (Accumulator Rule). On May 17, 2022, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America's (PhRMA) motion for summary judgement invalidating the Accumulator Rule. In February 2023, HHS also issued a proposal in response to an October 2022 executive order from President Biden that includes a proposed prescription drug pricing model that will test whether targeted Medicare payment adjustments will sufficiently incentivize manufacturers to complete confirmatory trials for drugs approved through FDA’s accelerated approval pathway. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the current U.S. presidential administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would limit the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The

effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known. These laws and regulations may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any cell therapies for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any cell therapies for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from payors. Payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers generally rely on these third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a payor not to cover our cell therapies could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development and manufacturing costs. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products.
In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Additionally, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. Payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive evidence generation studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such a product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to current standards of care, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to cover its costs or make a profit.
