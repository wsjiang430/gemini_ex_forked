Our Market Opportunity

In each of our businesses, we focus on solid, growing markets and capitalize on positive demographic and market trends. In our solar energy business, we intend to develop a vertically integrated solar energy business with nationwide geographical coverage. We believe these initiatives have the opportunity to increase market share, diversify geographical revenue streams, incorporate best practices across our portfolio, and provide increased cost savings by providing both purchasing power and lower general administrative cost across our solar energy operating businesses.
Solar Energy

The rise in environmental concerns regarding the increase in carbon emissions owing to the usage of conventional fuels for transportation and power generation purposes has prompted countries around the world to opt for cleaner and more efficient sources of power. Furthermore, the long-term power generation goals of North American countries such as the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have given impetus to the growth of clean energy technologies.

The U.S. residential solar PV market size was estimated at $9.1 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 5.6% from 2021 to 2028. The market is driven by the presence of favorable policies and regulations for net metering and financial incentives such as the ITC in the U.S. Currently, ITC provides a 26.0% tax credit for the installation of solar systems on residential properties under Section 25D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). A tax credit under the provision of the scheme provides a dollar-for-dollar decrease in the income tax that a person would have otherwise paid to the federal government. This has provided a thrust for residential end-users to opt for solar PV systems to get tax incentives.

The decrease in solar PV installation costs in the last decade has resulted in high growth of solar PV in the U.S. Further, the presence of easy solar financing options provides a number of options for residential end-users to choose from, which has propelled the growth of the market. According to Fortune Business Insights, the solar industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2021 through 2020. The market is expected to grow from approximately $184 billion in 2021 to $293 in 2028.

To externally grow our solar energy business, we intend to focus on the acquisition of high quality regional solar and solar-adjacent businesses. We intend to target companies that have a history great customer services, revenue and profitability. Solar and solar-adjacent businesses are highly regional and driven by local and federal incentives. For this reason, we believe it is highly important that any acquisition target have a leading regional presence. For our organic growth, we plan to drive customer acquisition through the creation of a national network focused on customer-centric solar businesses. We further believe being able to offer an all-in-one solution from client acquisition to installation enables the Company to competitively position itself. With a focus on long term customer relationships and the lifetime value of the customer, we intend to focus on our customer network for follow-on product and service offerings.

Air Purification

Air pollution is responsible for nearly 6.5 million deaths every year, making it the world’s fourth-largest threat to human health, according to a 2016 report by the International Energy Agency. Air purifiers can, to a large extent, help people who are suffering from asthma, airborne allergies and other breathing disorders.

According to a Market Insights report, the air purifier market is projected to witness a CAGR of 10.8% to almost $2.3 billion by 2023 and reach $2.9 billion by 2025, and $4.8 billion by 2030. The air purifier market in the United States was already valued at $1 billion in 2020 and is likely to grow further. The report further says that one of the biggest drivers of the growth has been the COVID-19 pandemic followed by additional concerns including cross-state pollution, natural disasters, and consumer education programs.

According to Grandview research, “[t]he global air purifier market size was estimated at $10.67 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $12.26 billion in 2021” with an expected CAGR of 6.2% through 2028. Box Pure Air was acquired in early 2021 and has significantly grown since. For the year ended December, 31, 2021, we achieved approximately $1 million in annual sales for our air purification business. We surpassed that number in the first quarter of 2022 and we anticipate significantly increased revenues for the year ending December 31, 2022.

COVID-19 is transmitted from an infected to a healthy person through respiratory droplets and contact routes. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, air purifiers can reduce airborne contaminants, which consist of viruses in any confined space. However, air purifiers still need to be used along with the other practices recommended by the CDC for an ideal plan to protect oneself against the disease. Given that even maintaining a six feet distance does not promise complete safety from being contracted by the virus, the use of air purifiers becomes all the more important.

Our clean environment business was implemented, in response to demand due to COVID-19 and effects of global pollution, to provide mobile air purification technology in closed environments that are unable to implement such technology on an attractive cost basis. We are being increasingly called upon to provide services to help prevent the spreading of airborne diseases and toxins, thereby improving the environmental quality, health and wellness of our end users who include students, first responders, professionals returning to offices and others. Our air purification business benefits from three sources of federal funding that provide capital allocations to elementary, middle and high schools for use in implementing air purification and ventilation improvement. In 2021, $121 billion was allocated to schools for this purpose.

Additionally, Singlepoint recently signed a 2-year distribution agreement with Tennessee-based Ballistic Barrier Products, with the goal of selling bullet-resistant window shades and door panels to schools. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which became law earlier this year, enacted new gun control measures and set aside $300 million to implement security measures against shooters that target schools. We believe that this naturally complements our current offerings to elementary, middle and high schools.

We have focused our development efforts on customer groups with proven use cases for our clean environment business. These customer groups range from health care facilities such as hospitals, nursing facilities, urgent care locations, and medical office waiting rooms to correctional facilities and general commercial office properties. We have leveraged our existing market position in the air purification industry to cross sell into newer market opportunities including sanitization, general air filer supply, and other safety services. 

Our Growth Strategy and Competitive Advantages

 Our goal is to develop or acquire ownership interests in companies that possess high-growth potential, and to provide those companies with management services that will help them grow. We believe that we can build a brand that is synonymous with integrity, strong corporate governance and transparency with an emphasis on social responsibility. Key elements of our growth strategy and competitive advantages include:

Accretive acquisitions and strategic relationships at each level of our company. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that consolidate market share, expand our geographical footprint and further our position as a participant in each of our principal businesses. We seek to identify and partner with companies with complementary technology and where our existing business extension opportunities could be commercially beneficial to them.

Diverse and competitive positioning of our companies. Our principal businesses operate in highly competitive but diverse markets which we believe balances the risk profile of our company. We believe the diverse and competitive positioning in these markets of our companies serves as a competitive strength.

Central management support for all companies. Our “hands-on” management team provides centralized management oversight across our principal businesses. We believe we can improve the margins by controlling costs at our businesses as we centralize business practices in functional areas including financing, accounting, human resources, back-office administration, information technology and risk management. These margin improvements can be accomplished through leveraging our centralized capital and management capabilities to allow our businesses to better focus their efforts on revenue generation and product enhancement. In addition, we seek to increase revenue for each of our majority-owned and/or wholly-owned operating subsidiaries by cross-selling the complementary technical services and distribution network of each company.

 Intellectual Property

Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. Competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the technologies we employ in our products and services. However, we maintain no material registered intellectual property assets.
Competition

The markets for our products are intensely competitive, continually evolving and subject to changing technologies. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have significantly greater name recognition, sales and marketing, financial, technical, customer support and other resources. These competitors may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.

These competitors may enter our existing or future markets with products that may be less expensive, that may provide higher performance or additional features or that may be introduced more quickly than our products.

We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, if we are not able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, it will be difficult to acquire and retain customers, and we may experience revenue declines, reduced operating margins, loss of market share and diminished value in our services.

Marketing and Sales

Our marketing efforts (conducted by us both with our own employees and through outside consultants) currently focus on increasing demand for our solutions utilizing targeted email campaigns, search engine optimization (“SEO”) and search engine marketing (“SEM”) advertising. In addition, we generate awareness by participating in industry tradeshows, issuing press releases and articulating our messaging through our website. We conduct our marketing activities domestically to promote our products independently and in cooperation with our strategic partners. Our product information is available on our website, which contains overview presentations.

We market and distribute our products through a partnership network of companies and we use a broad distribution channel to bring our products and solutions to our customers.

We have sales and support staff in various locations throughout the United States. Our inside sales group answers incoming leads from potential customers and refers these new leads to one of our partners. A new lead is a potential customer, client or user of one or more of the products and services Singlepoint either directly offers or refers to a partner. A partner is either one of our subsidiaries or one of the companies that we do business with.

Since the acquisition of Boston Solar, the Company’s solar sales strategy now includes an internal sales staff. Boston Solar employs approximately 85 individuals. Approximately 15 of these individuals are responsible for fielding inbound and outbound sales efforts and generating new potential customers through various marketing methods. Upon engaging with a potential solar client, our sales staff is able to create a solar proposal for the interested party. Once create the potential client will go through a series of presentations which leads to the purchasing decision. Once permitting is complete, Boston Solar proceeds to install the proposed solution for the client. Boston Solar mainly generates new clients through their presence in the community and the long history of respected business practices.

In the air purification market, there are currently three federal funding programs that provide federal capital allocation to schools PreK-12. In these federal funds, approximately $121 billion must be used for air purification and ventilation improvement in schools throughout the US. Our air purification business is predominately focused on acquiring customers in the public and private school markets. We generate new business through digital marketing campaigns and working to establish relationships with decision makers in each market.

Employees

Currently Singlepoint and its subsidiaries employ a total of approximately 100 individuals, all of whom are full-time employees. These individuals consist of management, developers, sales and support staff. Some of these individuals are employed through outside sourcing, working with us to hire qualified candidates. We believe our relations with our employees is satisfactory.
