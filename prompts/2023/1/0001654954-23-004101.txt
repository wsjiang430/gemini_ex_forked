The Company offers recruiting services and operates web-based platforms (the “Platform”) and a network of independent recruiters. Businesses from startups to the Fortune 100 use Recruiter.com to help address their critical talent needs and solve recruiting and hiring challenges. 

We have seven operating subsidiaries, Recruiter.com, Inc., Recruiter.com Recruiting Solutions LLC (“Recruiting Solutions”), Recruiter.com Consulting, LLC, VocaWorks, Inc. (“VocaWorks”), Recruiter.com Scouted Inc. (“Scouted”), Recruiter.com Upsider Inc. (“Upsider”) and Recruiter.com OneWire Inc. (“OneWire”).

For employers needing talent acquisition services, we place independent recruiters from our network with our clients on a project basis. To round out our offerings, we provide other talent acquisition support services, including job posting, consulting, staffing, and full-time placement services.

Our mission is to help recruit the right talent faster and become the preferred solution for hiring specialized talent. 

Corporate History

We were incorporated in February 2015 as a Delaware corporation. Effective March 31, 2019 (the “Effective Date”), we completed a merger with Recruiter.com, Inc. (“Pre-Merger Recruiter.com”), an affiliate of the Company, pursuant to a Merger Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 31, 2019 (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger, our newly formed wholly owned subsidiary merged with and into Pre-Merger Recruiter.com, with Pre-Merger Recruiter.com continuing as the surviving corporation and as our wholly owned subsidiary.

Following the Merger, on May 9, 2019, we changed our corporate name to Recruiter.com Group, Inc. Our fiscal year end was also changed, as of the Effective Date, from March 31 to December 31.

Immediately prior to the completion of the Merger, Pre-Merger Recruiter.com owned approximately 98% of our outstanding shares of common stock (“Common Stock”). The Merger did not result in a change of control of our Company, as the principal stockholders of Pre-Merger Recruiter.com had controlled the Company since October 2017 and the Merger simply increased their control. In addition, our President and Chief Operating Officer served as the Chief Executive Officer of Pre-Merger Recruiter.com and the majority of our directors at the time were directors (or designees) prior to the Merger. Further, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was retained as a consultant prior to the Merger with the understanding that if the Merger occurred, he would be appointed as our Executive Chairman.

Reincorporation and Reverse Stock Split

On May 13, 2020, we effected a reincorporation from the State of Delaware to the State of Nevada. Following the approval by our stockholders at a special meeting held on May 8, 2020, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Recruiter.com Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary (“Recruiter.com Nevada”), pursuant to which we merged with and into Recruiter.com Nevada, with Recruiter.com Nevada continuing as the surviving entity. Simultaneously with the reincorporation, the number of shares of common stock that we, as a Nevada corporation, are authorized to issue was increased from 31,250,000 shares to 250,000,000 shares. On June 18, 2021, we filed an Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effectuate a reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock at an exchange ratio of 1-for-2.5. The reverse stock split was effective as of June 18, 2021. Simultaneously with the reverse stock split, we reduced our authorized shares from 250,000,000 to 100,000,000. All share and per share data in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes and throughout this annual report has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the reverse stock split.

The reincorporation did not result in any change in our corporate name, business, management, fiscal year, accounting, location of the principal executive office, or assets or liabilities.

Scouted Asset Purchase

Effective January 31, 2021, we, through a wholly owned subsidiary, acquired all of the assets of RLJ Talent Consulting, Inc., dba Scouted, a Delaware corporation (“Scouted”) (the “Scouted Asset Purchase”). As consideration in the Scouted Asset Purchase, Scouted shareholders received a total of 224,163 shares of our restricted Common Stock (valued at $1,625,183 based on a $7.25 per share acquisition date price), of which 33,151 shares of stock were held in reserve and recorded as contingent consideration, a current liability in the accompanying financial statements, and an additional amount of $180,000 in cash consideration for a total purchase price of approximately $1.8 million. The 33,151 shares held in reserve were issued on December 13, 2021. The Scouted Asset Purchase was accounted for as a business acquisition. The assets acquired in the Scouted Asset Purchase consist primarily of sales and client relationships, contracts, intellectual property, partnership and vendor agreements and certain other assets (the “Scouted Assets”). We utilized the Scouted Assets to expand our video hiring solutions and curated talent solutions, through our Recruiting Solutions subsidiary.
Upsider Asset Purchase

Effective March 25, 2021, we, through a wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with Upsider, Inc., (“Upsider”), to acquire all the assets and certain liabilities of Upsider (the “Upsider Purchase”). As consideration for the Upsider Purchase, Upsider’s shareholders received net cash of $69,983 and a total of 323,094 shares of our Common Stock (the “Upsider Shares”) (valued at $2,544,362, based on a $7.88 per share acquisition date price), of which 51,940 of the Upsider Shares were held in reserve and were recorded as a current liability, contingent consideration in the accompanying financial statements. The shareholders of Upsider were paid earn-out consideration in the form of the issuance of 321,390 shares of our Common Stock on September 1, 2021 based on the attainment of specific targets during the nine months following closing. The total purchase price was approximately $3.9 million. The assets acquired in the Upsider Purchase consist primarily of sales and client relationships, contracts, intellectual property, partnership and vendor agreements and a de minimis amount of other assets. We also assumed a small amount of liabilities in the form of net payables. We utilize Upsider’s machine learning artificial intelligence to provide a more predictive and efficient recruiting tool that enhances our current technology. On December 5, 2022, The Company entered into an asset purchase agreement in which the Company sold to a third party Upsider’s candidate sourcing and engagement platform and all related intellectual property for $1,000,000 in cash consideration. The recorded value of the internal use software developed at the date of the sale was $1,000,000 resulting in no gain or loss on the sale. For a period of eighteen months from the date of the sale, the Company will have continued access to this platform.
OneWire Asset Purchase

Effective May 10, 2021, we, through a wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and Plan of Reorganization with OneWire Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OneWire”), to acquire all the assets and several liabilities of OneWire (the “OneWire Purchase”). As consideration for the OneWire Purchase, OneWire’s shareholders received a total of 155,327 shares (the “Consideration Shares”) of Common Stock, (valued at $1,255,000, based on a price per share of $8.0797, the volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock for the 30 day period immediately prior to the closing date), of which 31,066 of the Consideration Shares are subject to forfeiture as security against a post-closing working capital adjustment and a revenue true-up and pursuant to OneWire’s indemnity obligations. At the date of closing, the common stock was valued at $1,436,777 and there was a to be determined working capital adjustment to be paid in additional common shares recorded as a liability at a fair value of $45,751 for a total purchase price of $1,482,528. The assets acquired in the OneWire Purchase consist primarily of sales and client relationships, contracts, intellectual property, partnership and vendor agreements and certain other assets. OneWire’s expansive candidate database in financial services and candidate matching services amplifies our reach to give employers and recruiters access to an even broader pool of specialized talent.

Parrut Asset Purchase

Effective July 7, 2021, we entered into and closed on an Asset Purchase Agreement with Parrut, Inc. (“Parrut”), and certain individuals named therein. Parrut does business as Uncubed and we acquired the assets of the Technology Solutions Division of Uncubed. The purchased assets include assets related to Finalist, an online marketplace for sourcing and screening early-professional software and data candidates and assets related to Uncubed’s job board technology and candidate engagement platform which includes Mediabistro, a job board and professional community for media, content, and creative professionals (the “Parrut Purchase”).

As consideration for the Parrut Purchase, we paid $500,000 in cash at closing, a $1,750,000 promissory note with an interest rate of 6% and an original maturity date of July 1, 2023, and granted to Parrut 257,545 shares of our Common Stock, valued at $1,264,551. In addition, the terms of the Parrut Purchase include “earn-out” provisions under which we could become obligated to pay Parrut up to an additional $1,350,000 in the form of our Common Stock (the “Parrut Earn-Out Consideration”). The Parrut Earn-Out Consideration is equal to 1.35 times our revenue derived or generated from the assets purchased in the Parrut Purchase achieved during the twelve-month period immediately following the closing date. In October 2022, we confirmed Parrut earned the maximum earnout of $1,350,000 and we issued 1,374,678 common shares to Parrut at a price of $0.98 per share, the 20-day volume weighted average price prior to completion of the earnout period.

On October 19, 2022, Parrut agreed to subordinate their note to the loan owed to Montage Capital II, L.P. In return, we restructured the payment schedule to Parrut. The Parrut note now has an annual interest rate of 12% and matures on August 31, 2023.

Novo Asset Purchase

Effective August 27, 2021, we entered into and closed an Asset Purchase Agreement with the Novo Group, Inc. (the “Novo Group”), and certain individuals named therein. The Novo Group operates a recruitment services company for employers, providing talent, acquisition, and other hiring solutions.

We purchased substantially all of the assets of Novo Group (the “Novo Purchased Assets”). The Novo Purchased Assets include, among other assumed assets, certain contracts with Novo Group’s clients, permits owned, held and used by the Novo Group, intellectual property as well as tangible assets, and all of Novo Group’s accounts receivable (the “Novo Purchase”). Furthermore, we agreed to assume certain liabilities associated with the Novo Group business.

The amount due at closing was approximately $7,117,425 (the “Base Purchase Price”), consisting of the following consideration: (i) $1,337,500 in cash, (ii) a $3,000,000 promissory note with an interest rate of 6%, that matures on February 1, 2024, (iii) working capital adjustments in the amount of approximately $217,045, which was paid as of September 30, 2021, and (iv) 508,711 restricted shares of our Common Stock, valued at $2,019,583 (based on the acquisition date share price), of which 127,178 of our restricted shares of Common Stock were placed in escrow to account for post-closing adjustments in respect to Novo Group’s revenue from the closing date to the end of the 2021 calendar year, as well as to partially secure the indemnification obligations of Novo Group’s former owners.

In addition to the Base Purchase Price, there is an earn-out that is tied to revenue of Novo Group from sales of its products and services over eight calendar quarters (the “Earn-Out Period”), with such Earn-Out Periods beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2023. The Earn-Out Amount payable, if any, would equal to 5% of Novo Group’s revenue (“Earn-Out Amount”) for each applicable Earn-Out Period. Our preliminary estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration was $543,297 which has been revalued to $578,591 as of December 31, 2021.

On April 1, 2022, we entered into that certain Novo Adjusted Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Novo Group and a representative of Novo that had the effect of amending the Novo Asset Purchase Agreement and the Novo Note. A legend was affixed to the Novo Note stating that the Novo Note was subject to the terms of the Agreement. Under the Novo Asset Purchase Agreement, we owed an original principal amount to Novo Group of $3,000,000. Under the terms of the Agreement, the original principal amount due to Novo Group was reduced by $600,000 from $3,000,000 to $2,400,000 due to the employee turnover that occurred following the acquisition. Pursuant to the Agreement, the post-closing working capital adjustment amount of $52,117 due from us was forgiven and no additional amount is or will become due from the us as final excess with respect to the final closing working capital. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Earn-Out provision of the Asset Purchase Agreement is of no further force and effect, and consequently no further Earn-Out Payment would be earned by Novo Group or paid by us. The parties further agreed to an updated amortization schedule attached to the Agreement as discussed below. The reduction in the amounts owed to Novo Group was accounted for as a gain on debt extinguishment on the consolidated statement of operations.

In October 2022, Novo Group entered into a Subordination Agreement (“Subordination Agreement”), pursuant to which Novo agreed to subordinate all its indebtedness and obligations we owe to Novo to all the indebtedness and obligations we owe to Montage Capital.

In February 2023, we entered into an Amendment to the Promissory Note with Novo Group, Inc. (the “Novo Amendment”). The Novo Amendment further modifies the Promissory Note issued to Novo on August 27, 2021 (the “Novo Note”) and amended on April 1, 2022, by amending the payment schedule pursuant to which we would make payments of principal and interest to Novo. Novo agreed we would pay interest only for the period starting November 1, 2022 though and including March 31, 2023, with payments of principal and interest to resume starting April 1, 2023. We also replaced the existing payment schedule with a new payment schedule terminating on November 1, 2023.

Market Opportunity

Industry Overview

Employers invest significant amounts of capital in finding qualified employees, what we call the practice of “talent acquisition.” Market opportunities within talent acquisition are expansive and diverse. According to Statisa, the recruiting and staffing industry was worth over $185.5 billion dollars as of 2022, while IBISWorld pegs staffing and temp agencies to total over $200 billion dollars. The digital sector of the recruiting industry, in which we include our Platform, Recruiter.com, is growing rapidly within this large industry. IBISWorld anticipates that the $14 billion-dollar online recruitment sites sector will grow at a 13% rate in 2023.

This total industry market size includes companies that help other organizations find staff on a temporary or permanent basis, with the temporary staffing segment being significantly larger. The need for qualified and, in many cases, highly specialized talent, can be fulfilled by assisting companies in recruiting new internal staff or directly providing temporary staff to fill specific functions.

Overall, the U.S. recruitment industry is enormous, and it continues to grow, driven mainly by robust GDP growth creating demand for direct-hire (finding full-time employees) and contingent (placing project-based) workers. Demographic trends are also accelerating the demand for recruitment services: According to Seniorliving.org, from now until 2030, 10,000 Baby Boomers each day will hit retirement age. Employers often turn to the recruiting industry to close these talent gaps.

With employers continuing to struggle to find relevant candidates and more than 10.5 million open jobs in the U.S. as of December 2022, recruiting represents an enormous market opportunity. According to the leading human resource association, the Society for Human Resource Management, external sources-whether online job boards, recruiting agencies, campus events, job fairs, or walk-ins-produce approximately 65% of interviews compared to internal sources such as career sites, in-house recruiters and employee referrals, which is 35%. This 65% of role interviews generated by external sources provide a significant market opportunity for innovative recruiting technology companies to capture.  

Industry Trends

“The Great Resignation”

In 2021, U.S. employers experienced higher than normal rates of resignations. This trend has been described by many publications and named as “The Great Resignation.” Since April 2021, the share of nonfarm workers who quit their jobs has been at some of the highest levels recorded by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”). Abnormally high “quit rates” or what are called “churn rates” within the industry, may propel employers to invest historically high levels of capital toward recruitment and retention efforts to attract and maintain a qualified and productive workforce. The Great Resignation that has seen a record number of workers in the United States voluntarily resign from their jobs continued as close to 4.1 million workers quit in September 2022, according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) released by the BLS.

COVID-19

The recent COVID-19 pandemic dramatically affected the U.S. economy and the job market. Unemployment peaked at 14.7% in April of 2020. Since then, labor markets have continually improved, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.5% in December of 2022. U.S. payrolls jumped by 223,000 in December 2022, beating economists’ expectations for a ninth straight month, as the labor market showed continued resilience in a slowing economy.

Our management team believes that COVID-19 accelerated significant technology trends that had already existed before the pandemic. For example, the gig economy's growth (i.e., temporary, flexible jobs) was facilitated by technology, virtual and remote telework with video, and the emergence of On Demand labor through online marketplaces all happened before the crisis. The necessity of lockdowns and business closures drove increased technology adoption and moved these trends rapidly forward. As we operate as a virtual, AI, and video-based hiring platform operating in the gig economy, these trends may act as tailwinds for the adoption of our products and services.

We expect but cannot guarantee that demand for its recruiting solutions will improve in 2023, as certain clients re-open or accelerate their hiring initiatives, and new clients utilize our services. Overall, management is focused on effectively positioning the Company for a rebound in hiring which we believe will continue to happen in 2023. Ultimately, the recovery may be delayed and the economic conditions may worsen, depending upon changes in the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to closely monitor the confidence of our recruiter users and customers, and their respective job requirement load through offline discussions and our Recruiter Index survey.

We also may depend on raising additional debt or equity capital to stay operational. The economic impact of COVID-19, should the COVID-19 pandemic worsen, may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital when needed. The terms of any financing, if we are able to complete one, will likely not be favorable to us.

Inflation

The Company generally may be impacted by rising costs for certain inflation-sensitive operating expenses such as labor and employee benefits. The Company believes inflation could have a material impact to pricing and operating expenses in future periods due to the state of the economy and current inflation rates.
Employment Rate

The unemployment rate in January 2023 stood at 3.4%, which is historically low, signaling a “tight” labor market and a general lack of available qualified talent. However, many large companies, particularly in the technology sector, have implemented layoffs. The Company generally may be impacted by corporate layoffs of professional employees, if they are substantive, long-term, and/or widespread.

Operating Businesses and Revenue

We generate revenue from the following activities:


· | Software Subscriptions: We offer a subscription to our web-based platforms that help employers recruit talent. Our platforms allow our customers to source, contact, screen and sort candidates using data science, advanced email campaigning tools, and predictive analytics. As part of our software subscriptions, we offer enhanced support packages and On Demand recruiting support services for an additional fee. Additional fees may be charged when we place a candidate with our customer, depending on the subscription type. In such cases, if the candidate ceases to be employed by the customer during the initial 90 days (the 90-day guarantee), we refund the customer in full for all fees paid by the customer. In December of 2022, we sold one of our software platforms to Talent, Inc. that was used in the delivery of the subscription service. Subsequently, we continued providing the service, but leveraged third-party tools in the delivery of services. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Recruiters On Demand: Consists of a consulting and staffing service specifically for the placement of professional recruiters, which we market as Recruiters On Demand. Recruiters On Demand is a flexible, time-based solution that provides businesses of all sizes access to recruiters on an outsourced, virtual basis for help with their hiring needs. As with other consulting and staffing solutions, we procure for our employer clients qualified professional recruiters, and then place them on assignment with our employer clients. We derive revenue from Recruiters On Demand by billing the employer clients for the placed recruiters' ongoing work at an agreed-upon, time-based rate. We directly source recruiter candidates from our network of recruiters. In addition, we also offer talent planning, talent assessment, strategic guidance, and organizational development services, which we market as our “Talent Effectiveness” practice. Companies prepay for a certain number of consulting hours at an agreed-upon, time-based rate. We source and provide the independent consultants that provide the service. In March 2023, we announced a strategic partnership with Job Mobz to transition certain Recruiters on Demand clients and staff to Job Mobz in exchange for an ongoing revenue stream. 
· | Full-time Placement: Consists of providing referrals of qualified candidates to employers to hire staff for full-time positions. We generate full-time placement revenue by earning one-time fees for each time that employers hire one of the candidates that we refer. Employers alert us of their hiring needs through our Platform, or other communications. We source qualified candidate referrals for the employers’ available jobs through independent recruiter users that access the Platform and other tools. We support and supplement the independent recruiters’ efforts with dedicated internal employees we call our internal talent delivery team. Our talent delivery team selects and delivers candidate profiles and resumes to our employer clients for their review and ultimate selection. Upon the employer hiring one or more of our candidate referrals, we earn a “full-time placement fee”, an amount separately negotiated with each employer client. The full-time placement fee is typically either a percentage of the referred candidates’ first year base salary or an agreed-upon flat fee. 
· | Marketplace: Our “Marketplace” category comprises services for businesses and individuals that leverage our online presence. For businesses, this includes sponsorship of digital newsletters, online content promotion, social media distribution, banner advertising, and other branded electronic communications, such as in our quarterly digital publication on recruiting trends and issues. We earn revenue as we complete agreed upon marketing related deliverables and milestones using pricing and terms set by mutual agreement with the customer. In some cases, we earn a percent of revenue a business receives from attracting new clients by advertising on our online platform. Businesses can also pay us to post job openings on our proprietary job boards to promote open job positions they are trying to fill. In addition to its work with direct clients, we categorize all online advertising and affiliate marketing revenue as Marketplace. For individuals, Marketplace includes services to assist with career development and advancement, including a resume distribution service which involves promoting these job seekers’ profiles and resumes to assist with their procuring employment, and upskilling and training. Our resume distribution service allows a job seeker to upload his/her resume to our database, which we then distribute to our network of recruiters on the Platform. We earn revenue from a one-time flat fee for this service. We also offer a recruiter certification program which encompasses our recruitment related training content, which we make accessible through our online learning management system. Customers of the recruiter certification program use a self-managed system to navigate through a digital course of study. Upon completion of the program, we issue a certificate of completion and make available a digital badge to certify their achievement for display on their online recruiter profile on the Platform. Additionally, we partner with Careerdash, a high-quality training company, to provide Recruiter.com Academy, an immersive training experience for career changers.


9


· | Consulting and Staffing: Consists of providing consulting and staffing personnel services to employers to satisfy their demand for long- and short-term consulting and temporary employee needs. We generate revenue by first referring qualified personnel for the employer’s specific talent needs, then placing such personnel with the employer, but with our providers acting as the employer of record for us, and finally, billing the employer for the time and work of our placed personnel on an ongoing basis. Our process for finding candidates for consulting and staffing engagements largely mirrors our process for full-time placement hiring. This process includes employers informing us of open consulting and temporary staffing opportunities and projects, sourcing qualified candidates through the Platform and other similar means, and, finally, the employer selecting our candidates for placement after a process of review and selection. We bill these employer clients for our placed candidates’ ongoing work at an agreed-upon, time-based rate, typically on a weekly schedule of invoicing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We have a sales team and sales partnerships with direct employers as well as Vendor Management System companies and Managed Service companies that help create sales channels for clients that buy staffing, direct hire, and sourcing services. Once we have secured the relationship and contract with the interested Enterprise customer, the delivery and product teams will provide the service to fulfill any or all of the revenue segments.

The costs of our revenue primarily consist of employee costs, third-party staffing costs and other fees, outsourced recruiter fees and commissions based on a percentage of our gross margin.

Disrupting an Industry - Recruit Talent Faster

We believe we are fundamentally modernizing the recruiting process by digitizing and democratizing the recruiting process. We are distributing both the work and opportunity of recruiting to a broader community than ever before, enabling people to earn money through our platform and be their own bosses. Furthermore, we are dispersing the economic benefits of successful recruitment to a broad group of people. By doing so, we help businesses recruit talent faster and more efficiently than ever before.
Community and Network

We operate various publishing, social media, groups, and career communities that allow for user registration. We specialize in providing content, community, and resources for recruitment and talent acquisition professionals. We refer to the recruiting and talent acquisition professionals that connect with our various assets as our “Recruiter Network” or our “network of recruiters.” This network of recruiters allows us to maintain a close connection to the industry as a whole and be responsive to our clients’ demand for project-based and full-time recruiters. In addition, our network of recruiters serves as a general sales channel, to which we can market recruitment solutions, such as our recruiting software subscriptions.

We believe the potential scale of our Recruiter Network is enormous. With hundreds of thousands of people involved in the general human resource and employment industry in the United States alone, and many more interested in referral-based, work-from-home earning opportunities, we believe our addressable network and potential audience is significant. 

The Recruiter.com Website - a Top Destination

Our website is a popular destination for the recruiting and talent acquisition profession, with millions of pages of indexed content on career and recruitment issues and trends, email newsletters, and digital publications issued every quarter. Our internet traffic is generated by three primary groups of people: (1) recruiters seeking to join the network and platform, (2) enterprises seeking to recruit talent, and (3) candidates seeking to find opportunities through the community of recruiters. Overall, we are a well-known brand in the recruiting industry, and our vision is to build upon this success to become a clear leader in terms of traffic, mindshare, and usage within the recruiting business.

A comprehensive search engine optimization strategy fuels our marketing. SpyFu.com, a traffic analysis website, estimated that, as of March 2023, our website has obtained over 17,500 search terms on the first page of Google.com. We are also active on social media. Most notably, as of February 2023, we operated four of the top ten largest professional groups globally on the social media platform LinkedIn, out of approximately 2.3 million groups in total. These groups include the Recruiter.com Network, and groups for the professions of Project Managers, Marketers, and Information Technology.

Subsequent to the year, we added to our training offering by launching RecruitingClasses.com, a platform for knowledge sharing within the recruitment profession.

Our Recruiting Software

We offer employers a subscription service that provides campaigns to prospective employees and sends these candidates to the employers. The subscription is made possible by our AI based software, which matches job descriptions against a large database of candidate profiles. We refer to this software solution as our “AI Software”, “Talent Sourcing Software”, “the Platform” or simply, “Recruiter.com Software.” Our AI Software originated from our acquisition of Upsider, Inc. in 2021, and has since been further developed. In December 2022, we announced a strategic partnership with Talent, Inc., terms of which included the sale of certain intellectual property including the AI Software. For a period of eighteen months from the date of sale, the Company will have access to the platform sold to Talent, Inc. Subsequent to the sale, we continued to provide recruiting solutions leveraging third-party tools.
Our Career Communities

We own and develop a proprietary tool for job posting and career community sites, which originated from the purchase of certain assets from Parrut, Inc. known as Uncubed Technology and has since been further developed. We use this technology to operate certain career communities, including sites for recruitment and media professionals. We refer to the technology as our “Recruitment Marketing” technology and to the sites that leverage such technology as our “Career Communities.”
Career Community for Recruiting Professionals

We own and operate Recruiter Jobs, a specialized career community for recruiting and talent acquisition professionals. The community focuses on providing access to both contract and full-time job opportunities for recruiters.

Companies in the recruiting technology space, such as LinkedIn and Indeed.com, have achieved “unicorn” status as billion-dollar companies. Recruiter.com is a defining brand for the profession of recruiting and talent acquisition, a major industry, therefore management believes there to be a very large addressable market and opportunities for growth.

Our combination of innovative use of technology, a broad network of specialized recruiting professionals, and curated talent communities enable a traditionally service-heavy industry to be scalable in an entirely new way. We believe our brand and technology put us in a unique position in the market.

Management believes in the transformational power of new technologies, including AI, and plans to continue exploring various opportunities in the sector.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We aim to be opportunistic in the development and acquisition of such technologies for our users.

Our Clients

Our recruiting solutions allow us to meet the hiring needs of a variety of clients, from Fortune 100 enterprises to high-quality startups. We typically focus on filling highly skilled and senior-level roles in specialized fields, including technology, healthcare, finance, logistics/transportation, communications, engineering, energy, and many others.

The majority of our revenue (approximately 90%) is generated by providing Recruiting Solutions for employers, consisting of success-based placement fees for fulltime employee referrals and hourly and project-based fees for professional consulting and staffing. Our clients include Schlumberger, Halliburton Co., Ford Motor Co., Coca Cola Co., and Bluebeam, Inc. 

As of December 31, 2022, one customer, accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance, at 28%. As of December 31, 2021, two customers, accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance, at 14% and 12%, respectively, for a total of 26%.

Our Platform and Technology

Our AI Software

Prior to its sale, employers large and small used our AI-based recruiting software and the Platform to identify great candidates and shave time off the recruiting process. Our software allows employers to outreach to qualified applicants and receive qualified and interested talent in a variety of methods. Overall, employers can use the subscription to spend more time collaborating with teams and less time on the hiring process itself. For a period of eighteen months from the date of sale, the Company will have access to the Platform.

Our Technology Infrastructure

Hosting

We currently host websites and data with Amazon’s web hosting service.

Personnel

Software development, database management, remote server administration, quality assurance, and administrative systems access is managed by our Product Director, and prior to December 2022, our former Chief Technology Officer. Our public websites are also maintained under the direction of our Chief Web Officer, Ashley Saddul, who currently resides overseas in Mauritius. From time to time, we also engage technical personnel on an as-needed basis from other locations, including overseas locations. Outsourced personnel are managed by the Product and web teams as well.
Product Development

We continue to invest in product development, develop new products and features, and further build our infrastructure. Our goal is to enable employers to identify and engage with top talent faster than ever before.
Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines Platform improvements that we intend to launch over the next year. While our overall strategic direction changes little, these specific projects cannot be guaranteed and often change. Specific projects include:

· | Improvements in the user interface of our career communities 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------
· | Improvements in automation of our On Demand recruiting services

Sales and Marketing Strategy

Our sales and marketing strategy is centered around driving cost-effective awareness of our brand and the benefits of our platform among recruiters and employers of all sizes, from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies. Most of our new recruiter and employer registrations come from direct navigation to our website through unpaid search engine results listings, social media, and other content-based, no-cost referrals. We draw on our robust recruiting and staffing business foundation to build a sales pipeline and grow account relationships.
Sales Strategy

Most of our sales opportunities are derived from internet marketing and content strategies, which generate interest and traffic from search engines, such as Google, which index our website content. Word of mouth, customer and user referrals, and general brand recall and recognition also generate a significant number of visits to our website. Visitors to our website then express interest and contact us through standard electronic forms on our website. We employ Account Managers who follow up with these leads and perform inbound or inside sales functions to develop quality relationships with our customers. As much as possible, we rely on automated contact solutions to engage with our clients seamlessly. Our sales strategy includes the hiring of both internal and external sales and sales management personnel to conduct our sales relationships. As we expand our solution offerings, we will increasingly cross-sell across our On Demand recruiting technology and solutions.

We intend to employ several strategic methods to attract the best sales talent, including by offering attractive commission splits, bonuses, technology capabilities, and lead generation. These factors, in addition to the benefits of our Recruiter.com brand, should facilitate the recruitment of highly qualified talent. Also, we look for ways to partner with leading recruiting firms and successful independent recruiting salespeople, allowing them to sell under the Recruiter.com brand to accelerate our organic growth significantly.

Partnerships

We have forged relationships with many firms in the recruiting, HR, and payroll space. Partnerships constitute an essential component of our sales and marketing strategy, as these partnerships may stimulate sales demand for our hiring solutions, including success-based recruiting, On Demand offerings, and, in the future, video screening services. We pursue strategic alliances with employer service providers for joint marketing and cross-selling activities, and we seek platform integrations with strategic partners to generate client demand.
Public Relations

For PR and marketing purposes, we rely mostly on the continued development of our thought leadership content. Recruiter Index®, our proprietary analysis that pinpoints recruiting trends and forecasts business growth, will form the bedrock of our thought leadership strategy.

No one understands the talent market like the recruiters, HR professionals, and talent acquisition experts working on the front lines. We have the unique ability to survey our vast network of independent recruiting and talent acquisition specialists to uncover job market trends. Given the Recruiter Index’s® consistent media appearances beginning in June 2020, including on CNBC, there appears to be strong demand for leading indicators of the labor market.


17

Community Management

We consider our community management an essential part of our revenue generation strategy, as active engagement of our network leads to the further output of successful candidate matches. The principles of our approach to community management include:

● | Value: Each member of the recruiter network is an asset to our business. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Understanding: We form relationships with a human touch and develop real understandings of recruiters’ business needs and capacities.
● | Personal: Every On Demand recruiter has a named contact. 
● | Shared Success: We take pride in our community, and we incentivize success and connections. 

Competition

The market for online staffing and recruitment services is highly competitive, fragmented, and undergoing rapid changes following increasing demand, technological advancements, and shifting needs. We compete with several online and offline platforms and services, including but not limited to, the following:

● | Traditional talent acquisition and staffing service providers and other outsourcing providers, such as the Adecco Group, Korn Ferry, Russell Reynolds Associates, Inc., and Robert Half International, Inc.;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Other e-staffing and recruitment marketplace providers, such as Hired.com, Scout Exchange, and Reflik; 
● | Professional and personal social media platforms, such as LinkedIn and Facebook; 
● | Software and business services companies focused on video hiring talent acquisition, management, invoicing, or staffing management products and services; 
● | Online and offline job boards, classified ads, and other traditional means of finding work and service providers, such as Craigslist, CareerBuilder, Indeed, Monster, and ZipRecruiter; and 
● | Additionally, well-established internet companies, such as Google and Amazon, have entered or may decide to join our market and compete with our Platform. 


We compete based on several factors, including, among other things: size and engagement of user base, brand awareness and reputation, relationships with third party partners, and pricing. We differentiate ourselves through what we call our “three uniques:” people, power, and platform. We pride ourselves on:


● | Our people, who are experts in the recruiting industry; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The power of our robust network of recruiters, top internet brand, distribution channels, and content and social media followings; and 
● | The Platform, which is a complete and custom-built software platform, with many integrations and partnerships, which has developed over several years.


These “three uniques” form our competitive “moat,” which management believes would be highly challenging for any competitor to replicate.

Intellectual Property

The protection of our intellectual property is an essential aspect of our business. We own our domain names and trademarks relating to our website’s design and content, including our brand name and various logos and slogans. We rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements and invention or work product assignment agreements with our employees and consultants to control access to and clarify ownership of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information.

As of March 22, 2023, our trademarks include the terms “Recruiter.com” and “Recruiter Index.” 

Government Regulation

We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that apply to internet companies and businesses that operate online marketplaces connecting businesses with recruiters. These laws and regulations may involve worker classification, employment, data protection, privacy, online payment services, content regulation, intellectual property, taxation, consumer protection, background checks, payment services, money transmitter regulations, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, and sanctions laws, or other matters. Many of the rules and regulations that are or may apply to our business are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could adversely impact our business. Also, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the industry in which we operate.

Additionally, our Platform and the platform user data it uses, collects, or processes to run our business is an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our compliance with laws dealing with the use, collection, and processing of personal data is part of our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust.

Regulators around the world have adopted, or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two such governmental regulations that carry implications for our platform are the GDPR and the CCPA.

The GDPR went into effect in May 2018, implementing more stringent requirements in relation to companies’ use of personal data relating to all EU individuals (“data subjects”). Under the GDPR, the expanded definition of personal data includes information such as name, identification number, email address, location data, online identifiers such as internet protocol addresses and cookie identifiers, or any other type of information that can identify a living individual. The GDPR imposes a number of new requirements, which include: a valid ground for processing each instance of personal data; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; providing expanded information about how data subjects’ personal data is or will be used; carrying out data protection impact assessments for operations which present specific risks to individuals due to the nature or scope of the processing operation; an obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights; the principle of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training, and audit; profiling restrictions; and a new mandatory data breach reporting regime.

In the United States, California recently adopted the CCPA, which came into effect in January 2020. Similar in certain respects to the GDPR, the CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expanded definition of “personal information”; new data privacy rights for California residents, requiring covered businesses to provide further disclosure to consumers and affording consumers the right to opt-out of individual sales of personal information; special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors; and a potentially severe statutory damages framework and private rights of action for CCPA violations and failure to implement reasonable security procedures and practices.

Facilities

Our corporate headquarters are located in New York City, New York. We operate from time to time in leased flexible office space, such as WeWork offices.

We believe that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future, and that, should it be needed, suitable additional space will be available to accommodate any such expansion of our operations.

We strive to make a product that makes a difference, and one that helps build a just, equitable future for us all. We are committed to being an equal opportunity employer ourselves, and we only work with clients who respect both the law and spirit of equal opportunity employment. Further, we believe that, as we grow as a company, our success will be predicated on drawing from and amplifying a diverse range of voices, both internally and externally.

We welcome people from all backgrounds to apply to our internal careers and our client roles. We are also very interested in developing new practices to increase fairness in our hiring processes, including quantitative assessments, bias training, and reducing bias from new virtual tools that we introduce, such as video screening. We regularly and routinely seek out ways to improve our recruiting practices and expand the breadth and depth of our network of recruiters.
