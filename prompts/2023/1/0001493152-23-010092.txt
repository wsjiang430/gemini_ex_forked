ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
China Foods Holdings Ltd. (the “Company”, “CFOO”, or “we”) was incorporated in Delaware on January 10, 2019. On January 23, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Agreement”) with Trafalgar Resources, Inc., a Utah corporation (“Trafalgar”). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company merged with Trafalgar (the “Merger”) with the Company as the surviving entity. Prior to the Merger, Trafalgar had not commenced operations for several years that had resulted in significant revenue and Trafalgar’s efforts had been devoted primarily to activities related to raising capital and attempting to acquire an operating entity.
 
The Company is a Delaware holding company and we conduct our business through our wholly owned subsidiary Guangzhou Xiao Xiang Health Industry Company Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of China on March 8, 2017 (“GXXHIC”). GXXHIC is wholly owned by Alpha Wellness (HK) Limited, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Hong Kong on April 24, 2019, which is in turn wholly owned by Elite Creation Group, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the British Virgin Islands formed on September 5, 2018. Alpha Wellness (HK) Limited and Elite Creation Group are holding companies without operations and are wholly owned by the Company.
 
Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China, and are governed by Chinese laws, rules and regulations. Our subsidiary, GXXHIC, is subject to Chinese laws, rules, and regulations. Uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws, rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Risks and uncertainties arising from the legal system in China, including risks and uncertainties regarding that the rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice and that the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities.
 
Our History
 
Prior to the Merger, Trafalgar’s majority stockholder who owned 5,000,000 shares (approximately 95.2%) of the 5,251,309 outstanding shares of Trafalgar’s common stock, par value $0.0001, signed a written consent approving the Merger and the related transactions. Such approval and consent were sufficient under Utah law and Trafalgar’s Bylaws to approve the Merger. The boards of directors and shareholders of the Company and Trafalgar approved the Merger.
 
Pursuant to the Merger, each share of Trafalgar’s common stock was converted into one share of the Company’s common stock. After the Merger, HY (HK) Financial Investments Co., Ltd. owns 5,001,000 shares of common stock of the Company.
 
The Merger was effective on March 13, 2019.
 
On December 11, 2019, the Board of Directors approved a change to its fiscal year-end from September 30 to December 31. As a result of this change, the fiscal year is a 3 month transition period beginning October 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020. In these statements, including the notes thereto, financial results for fiscal 2019 are for a 3-month period. Corresponding results for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 are both for 12-month periods.
 
On July 9, 2020, the Company consummated the Share Exchange Agreement (“the “Share Exchange Agreement”) with Elite Creation Group Limited, a private limited company organized under the laws of British Virgin Islands (“ECGL”). As a result of the acquisition of ECGL, the Company entered into the healthcare product distributing and marketing industry, pursuing a new strategy of developing and distributing health related products, including supplements, across the globe with a focus on mainland China, Europe and Australia.
 
ECGL will comprise the ongoing operations of the combined entity and its senior management will serve as the senior management of the combined entity, ECGL is deemed to be the accounting acquirer for accounting purposes. The transaction will be treated as a recapitalization of the Company. Accordingly, the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Company will become the historical financial statements of ECGL, and the Company’s assets, liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with ECGL beginning on the acquisition date. ECGL was the legal acquiree but deemed to be the accounting acquirer. The Company was the legal acquirer but deemed to be the accounting acquiree in the reverse merger. The historical financial statements prior to the acquisition are those of the accounting acquirer (ECGL). After completion of the Share Exchange Transaction, the Company’s consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities, the operations and cash flow of the accounting acquirer.

Our Strategies
 
We are focused on achieving long-term growth in revenues, cash flow and profit. We believe that we can achieve this by developing multiple distribution channels and strengthening our marketing and promotions, leading to better product turnover and revenue. We also expect to broaden our product range as well as product differentiation in the future. Based on the business experience accumulated over the years, we believe we can improve the efficiency of our supply chain with time-saving and cost-saving supply chain management and marketing planning for the target customer base with our one-stop service.
 
Our primary aims are (i) to strengthen our product salability; (ii) to cut logistics cost and time spent and (iii) to further expand the market share in China. Toward this end, we plan to pursue the following business strategies:
 

● | Collaborate with third-party e-commerce platforms to boost product exposure, e.g. Tmall, Jingdong mall 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Deliver healthcare knowledge and consultation service via social media and We-media 
● | Build brand image and reputation through customer experience and word of mouth 
● | Increase the number of downstream distributors and wholesalers 
● | Strengthen the relationship with manufacturers, suppliers, drug agents and distributors 
● | Pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships 

 
We intend to develop both online and offline distribution channels to increase sales volume and revenue. We expect to partner with third party e-commerce platforms, social media and We-media such as Wechat, TikTok and Xiaohongshu to build our online presence. We believe that online channels will allow us to provide real-time nutrition and healthcare consultation services as well as increase customer engagement and retention. Starting from the second half of 2020, we have launched our “nutrition consulting” support services using a major social media software to allow customer groups to receive pre-purchase consultation and after-sales service for products anytime and anywhere.
 
Our current offline sales channel relies on distributors and sales agents. To enhance the visibility and marketability of our products and services and to improve brand recognition and awareness, we hope to develop store-in-shop and counter experiences. We also intend to partner with high-end gyms to form nutrition clubs and hold weight-loss training camps, health assessment and fitness training camps and other activities.
 
We intend to create a ‘one-stop’ solution for our customers by creating a multi-channel health product supply and retail system. We not only provide personalized consultation service to our customers, but also summarize and analyze our customer feedback and experiences through our consultation service and after-sales service. We intend to share this data with our manufacturers and supply chain partners to develop products and services that better meet the demands of our customers. By pooling and addressing the needs of downstream businesses and combining it with the Consumer to Manufacturer model for upstream transformation, we anticipate establishing a close relationship between manufacturers and suppliers. We believe this model can also reduce circulation costs and improve the efficiency of our supply chain.
 
We are a Delaware corporation and we conduct our primary operations in China through our subsidiary GXXHIC. We face various risks and uncertainties related to doing business in China. Our subsidiary GXXHIC is subject to complex and evolving PRC laws and regulations. Recently, the PRC enacted rules and regulations governing offshore offerings, anti-monopoly actions, and additional oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy.
 
We do not believe that GXXHIC is in violation of any laws, rules or regulations but since these newly enacted rules are still evolving, we cannot assure you that our business operations comply with such regulations and authorities’ requirements in all respects during the development of these new rules. However, in terms of business operation, GXXHIC expects to adapt to the newly issued rules and take dependent measures to comply with the laws and regulations of the Chinese authorities.

The PRC government’s authority in regulating our operations and its oversight and control over offerings and listings conducted overseas by, and foreign investment in, China-based issuers could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors. Implementation of industry-wide regulations in this nature may cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. Risks and uncertainties arising from the legal system in China, including risks and uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws and quickly evolving rules and regulations in China, could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities. But so far, the current operation and securities value of the Company are stable, and we believe that its risks are to the Company are manageable.
 
For example, the recently promulgated PRC Data Security Law and the PRC Personal Information Protection Law in 2021 posed additional challenges to our cybersecurity and data privacy compliance. The Cybersecurity Review Measures issued by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC and several other PRC governmental authorities in December 2021, as well as the Administration Regulations on Cyber Data Security (Draft for Comments) published by the CAC for public comments in November 2021, exposes uncertainties and potential additional restrictions on China-based overseas-listed companies like us. If the detailed rules, implementations, or the enacted version of the draft measures mandate clearance of cybersecurity review and other specific actions to be completed by us, we face uncertainties as to whether such clearance can be timely obtained, the failure of which may subject us to penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations and the price of our securities. However, as the Company operates in a traditional food industry, we believe the promulgation of the above laws will have a low impact on the Company and CFOO believes it is in compliance with the above laws.
 
In addition, on December 24, 2021, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, published the draft Regulations of the State Council on the Administration of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments), or the Administrative Provisions, and the draft Administrative Measures for the Filing of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (Draft for Comments) for public comments. Pursuant to these drafts, PRC domestic companies that directly or indirectly seek to offer or list their securities on an overseas stock exchange, including a PRC company limited by shares and an offshore company whose main business operations are in China and intends to offer securities or be listed on an overseas stock exchange based on its onshore equities, assets, incomes or similar interests, are required to file with the CSRC within three business days after submitting their application documents to the regulator in the place of intended listing or offering. Particularly, as for the PRC domestic companies that have directly or indirectly listed securities in overseas markets intend to conduct follow-on offerings in overseas markets, such companies are required to submit the filing with respect to the follow-on offering within three business days after completion of the follow-on offering.
 
Furthermore, the PRC anti-monopoly regulators have promulgated new anti-monopoly and competition laws and regulations and strengthened the enforcement under these laws and regulations. There remain uncertainties as to how the laws, regulations and guidelines recently promulgated will be implemented and whether these laws, regulations and guidelines will have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We do not believe there GXXHIC is in violation of any laws, rules or regulations related to monopolies or competition but we cannot assure you that our business operations comply with such regulations and authorities’ requirements in all respects. If any non-compliance is raised by relevant authorities and determined against us, we may be subject to fines and other penalties. These risks could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer securities to investors, or cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.
 
Permissions Required from the PRC Authorities for Our Operations
 
GXXHIC has received a Business License from the relevant department of the State Administration for Market Regulation. Apart from the Business License, GXXHIC may be subject to additional licensing requirements for our business operation due to the uncertainties of interpretation and implementation of relevant laws and regulations and the enforcement practice by relevant government authorities.
 
Furthermore, in connection with the operations of GXXHIC, as of the date of this report, neither GXXHIC nor the Company are required to obtain any approval or permission from the CSRC, CAC or any other PRC governmental authorities, nor has the Company or GXXHIC received any formal inquiry, notice, warning or sanction from any PRC governmental authorities in connection with requirements of obtaining such approval or permission, under any currently effective PRC laws, regulations and regulatory rules.

However, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers like us, and published a series of proposed rules for public comments in this regard, the enaction timetable, final content, interpretation and implementation of which remains uncertain. Therefore, there are substantial uncertainties as to how PRC governmental authorities will regulate overseas listing in general and whether we are required to complete filing or obtain any specific regulatory approvals from the CSRC, CAC or any other PRC governmental authorities for our future offshore offerings. If we had inadvertently concluded that such approvals were not required, or if applicable laws, regulations or interpretations change in a way that requires us to obtain such approval in the future, we may be unable to obtain such necessary approvals in a timely manner, or at all, and such approvals may be rescinded even if obtained. Any such circumstance could subject us to penalties, including fines, suspension of business and revocation of required licenses, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.
 
Our Subsidiary, GXXHIC, is Subject to Chinese Laws, Rules, And Regulations
 
Our subsidiary, GXXHIC, is subject to Chinese laws, rules, and regulations. Uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws, rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that GXXHIC will continue to manage any adverse effects on the premise of complying with Chinese laws, rules, and regulations. Risks and uncertainties arising from the legal system in China, including risks and uncertainties regarding that the rules and regulations in China can change quickly with little advance notice and that the Chinese government may intervene or influence our operations at any time, could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our securities.
 
Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China, and are governed by Chinese laws, rules and regulations. The Chinese legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which legal cases may be cited for reference but have limited value as precedents. In the late 1970s, the Chinese government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past four decades has significantly increased the protections afforded to various forms of foreign or private-sector investment in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties.
 
From time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to interpret and/or enforce our legal rights. However, since Chinese administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings, and the level of legal protection we enjoy, than in more developed legal systems. Any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Furthermore, the Chinese legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published in a timely manner or at all) that may have retroactive effect.
 
As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of our contractual, property (including intellectual property) and procedural rights, and any failure to respond to changes in the regulatory environment in China could affect our business and our ability to continue our operations.

Changes in Chinese political policies and economic and social policies or conditions may affect and fluctuate our business, results of operations and financial condition and may affect our growth and expansion strategies.
 
Substantially all of our assets and business operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally, by continued economic growth in China as a whole, and by geopolitical stability in the region.
 
The Chinese economy, markets and levels of consumer spending are influenced by many factors beyond our control, including current and future economic conditions, political uncertainty, unemployment rates, inflation, fluctuations in the level of disposable income, taxation, foreign exchange control, and changes in interest and currency exchange rates. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, foreign exchange control and fiscal measures and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures since the late 1970s emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the restructuring of state assets and state-owned enterprises, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a significant portion of productive assets in China is still owned or controlled by the Chinese government. The Chinese government also exercises significant control or influence over Chinese economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary and fiscal policies, regulating financial services and institutions and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.
 
While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in recent decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall Chinese economy but may also have an effect on us. Our results of operations and financial condition could be affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us. In addition, the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China.
 
Transfers of Cash to and from Our Subsidiaries
 
China Foods Holdings Ltd is a Delaware holding company with no operations of its own. We conduct our operations in Hong Kong through our subsidiary in Hong Kong, while our operations in PRC are conducted through our subsidiary in PRC. We may rely on dividends to be paid by our Hong Kong subsidiary to fund our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, to service any debt we may incur and to pay our operating expenses. There is a possibility that the PRC could prevent our cash maintained in Hong Kong from leaving or the PRC could restrict the deployment of the cash into our business or for the payment of dividends. Any such controls or restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our cash requirements, service debt or declare a dividend or other distributions to our shareholders. If our Hong Kong subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. To date, our subsidiaries have not made any transfers, dividends or distributions to China Foods Holdings Ltd. and China Foods Holdings Ltd. has not made any transfers, dividends or distributions to our subsidiaries.
 
China Foods Holdings Ltd. is permitted under the Delaware laws to provide funding to our subsidiaries in Hong Kong through loans or capital contributions without restrictions on the amount of the funds, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration, approval and filing requirements. Our Hong Kong subsidiary s also permitted under the laws of Hong Kong to provide funding China Foods Holdings Ltd. through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. As of the date of this report, there has been no dividends or distributions among the holding company or the subsidiaries nor do we expect such dividends or distributions to occur in the foreseeable future among the holding company and its subsidiaries.
 
We currently intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination related to our dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors after considering our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual requirements, business prospects and other factors the board of directors deems relevant, and subject to the restrictions contained in any future financing instruments.
 
Subject to the Delaware Statutes and our bylaws, our board of directors may authorize and declare a dividend to shareholders at such time and of such an amount as they think fit if they are satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that immediately following the dividend the value of our assets will exceed our liabilities and we will be able to pay our debts as they become due. There is no further Delaware statutory restriction on the amount of funds which may be distributed by us by dividend.

Under the current practice of the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, no tax is payable in Hong Kong in respect of dividends paid by us. The laws and regulations of the PRC do not currently have any material impact on transfer of cash from China Foods Holdings Ltd. to our Hong Kong subsidiaries or from our Hong Kong subsidiaries to China Foods Holdings Ltd. There are no restrictions or limitation under the laws of Hong Kong imposed on the conversion of HK dollar into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of Hong Kong or across borders and to U.S investors.
 
Current PRC regulations permit PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to Hong Kong subsidiaries only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each of such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any PRC subsidiaries.
 
The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if our subsidiaries in the PRC incur debt on their own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to receive all of the revenues from our operations, we may be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.
 
Cash dividends, if any, on our common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%.
 
In order for us to pay dividends to our shareholders, we will rely on payments made from our Hong Kong subsidiary to China Foods. Certain payments from PRC subsidiaries to Hong Kong subsidiaries will be subject to PRC taxes, including business taxes and VAT. As of the date of this report, our Hong Kong subsidiary has not made any transfers or distributions.
 
Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, the 10% withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns no less than 25% of a PRC entity. However, the 5% withholding tax rate does not automatically apply and certain requirements must be satisfied, including, without limitation, that (a) the Hong Kong entity must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends; and (b) the Hong Kong entity must directly hold no less than 25% share ownership in the PRC entity during the 12 consecutive months preceding its receipt of the dividends. In current practice, a Hong Kong entity must obtain a tax resident certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority and enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under the Double Taxation Arrangement with respect to dividends to be paid by a PRC subsidiary to its immediate holding company. As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have a PRC subsidiary. In the event that we acquire or form a PRC subsidiary in the future and such PRC subsidiary desires to declare and pay dividends to our Hong Kong subsidiary, our Hong Kong subsidiary will be required to apply for the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority. In such event, we plan to inform the investors through SEC filings, such as a current report on Form 8-K, prior to such actions.
 
The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCA Act”)
 
The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the “HFCAA”), was enacted on December 18, 2020. The HFCAA requires that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) determine whether it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms located in a non-U.S. jurisdiction because of a position taken by one or more authorities in that jurisdiction. Our auditor, HKCM & CPA Co., is based in Hong Kong and is subject to the determinations announced by the PCOAB on December 16, 2021 and the HFCAA. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB reported its determination that it was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in the PRC and Hong Kong, because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. On March 30, 2022, based on this determination, the Company was transferred to the SEC’s “Conclusive list of issuers identified under the HFCA.” Since our auditor is located in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB has been unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities, our auditor is not currently inspected by the PCAOB. The HFCAA states that if the SEC determines that we have filed audit reports issued by a registered public accounting firm that has not been subject to inspection by the PCAOB for two consecutive years beginning in 2021, the SEC shall prohibit our shares from being traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States. The related risks and uncertainties could cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or be worthless.

On August 26, 2022, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance of the PRC (the “MOF”), and the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol (the “Protocol”), governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in Mainland China and Hong Kong, taking the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in Mainland China and Hong Kong. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol disclosed by the SEC, the PCAOB shall have independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB Board determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in Mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate its previous determinations to the contrary. However, should PRC authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB’s access in the future, the PCAOB Board will consider the need to issue a new determination. In the event it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor, then such lack of inspection could cause trading in our securities to be prohibited under the HFCA Act, and ultimately result in a determination by a securities exchange to delist our securities.
 
While there has been dialogue among the CSRC, the SEC and the PCAOB regarding the inspection of PCAOB-registered accounting firms in China, including the Statement of Protocol, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with requirements imposed by U.S. regulators or Nasdaq. In December 2022, the PCAOB vacated its determination that it was unable to inspect and investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in mainland China. Until a new determination is reached by the PCAOB, the SEC has determined that there are no issuers currently at risk of having their securities subject to a trading prohibition under the HFCA Act. Although we are committed to complying with the rules and regulations applicable to listed companies in the United States, if the PCAOB were to issue a new determination regarding limitations on its ability to inspect or investigate our independent auditor and we were to fail to meet the audit requirements of the HFCA Act for two consecutive years, we may be prohibited from listing our securities on a national securities exchange and be delisted from the OTC Market. Delisting of our securities would force holders of our securities to sell their securities or convert them into our ordinary shares. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected as a result of anticipated negative impacts of these executive or legislative actions upon, as well as negative investor sentiment towards, companies with significant operations in China that are listed in the United States, regardless of whether these executive or legislative actions are implemented and regardless of our actual operating performance. The related risks and uncertainties could cause the value of our shares to significantly decline or be worthless.
