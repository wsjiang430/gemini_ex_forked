ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
During the year ended December 31, 2022 and prior to closing the Business Combination, JATT was a blank check company incorporated on March 10, 2021 as a Cayman Islands corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “Business Combination”). For more information on the Business Combination, see the section entitled “Explanatory Note” elsewhere in this Report. Prior to closing the Business Combination, we neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue. Based on our business activities prior to closing the Business Combination, we were a “shell company” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we had no operations and nominal assets consisting solely of cash and/or cash equivalents.
On March 22, 2021, JATT Ventures, LP (the “sponsor”), purchased 4,312,500 founder shares, which were JATT Class B ordinary shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share. On June 14, 2021, the sponsor surrendered 862,500 founder shares to us for no consideration, resulting in a decrease in the total number of founder shares outstanding from 4,312,500 to 3,450,000. Prior to the investment in the Company of $25,000 by the sponsor the Company had no assets, tangible or intangible. On July 16, 2021 the Company consummated the initial public offer, or IPO, of 12,000,000 units (the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value $0.0001 per share (“JATT Class A Ordinary Shares”) and one-half of one redeemable warrant each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share (“Public Warrants”). The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $120,000,000. As of July 16, 2021, a total of $121,200,000 ($10.10 per Unit) of the net proceeds from the IPO and a portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement (as defined below) were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company’s public shareholders (the “Trust Account”). On July 19, 2021, in connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 1,800,000 Units, and the sale of an additional 540,000 Private Placement Warrants each at $1.00 per warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $18,540,000. Following the closing, an additional $18,180,000 of the net proceeds ($10.10 per Unit) was placed in the Trust Account, resulting in $139,380,000 ($10.10 per Unit) held in the Trust Account.
Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated a private placement (the “Private Placement”) in which the sponsor purchased 5,370,000 private warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $5,370,000. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Ordinary Share for $11.50 per share, and is subject to transfer restrictions. Upon the closing of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in full on July 19, 2021, an additional 540,000 Private Placement Warrants were purchased by the sponsor at a price of $1.00 per warrant for a total of $540,000. As a result, a total of 5,910,000 Private Placement Warrants were purchased by the Sponsor for aggregate consideration of $5,910,000 in connection with the closing of the IPO and the closing of the over-allotment option. The Private Placement Warrants may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders thereof until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. The holders of the Private Placement Warrants were granted certain demand and piggyback registration rights in connection with the Private Placement. The Private Placement Warrants were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as the transactions did not involve a public offering.
Following the closing of the IPO on July 13, 2021 and the underwriters’ exercise of over-allotment option on July 19, 2021, $139,380,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account.
At December 31, 2022, the Company had $141,474,352 held in the Trust Account, which primarily consisted of investments in mutual funds that invest in U.S. government securities, cash, or a combination thereof.
Redemptions by Public Shareholders
In connection with JATT’s shareholder proposal to amend its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the date by which JATT was required to consummate a business combination, which was approved at an extraordinary general meeting held on January 12, 2023, the holders of 12,111,022 of JATT’s Class A Ordinary Shares, exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.26 per share for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $124,226,450.64.

​



interest rate equal to 9.0% per annum, compounding daily. Under the Hydra Promissory Note, Hydra had the right to accelerate the Hydra Promissory Note and receive an amount equal to 120% of the Principal Amount because the registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Business Combination was not declared effective by the SEC on or before February 15, 2023. On March 8, 2023, Zura and Hydra signed a limited waiver letter under the Hydra Promissory Note (the “Waiver Letter”), pursuant to which Hydra agreed to waive its acceleration right in consideration of Zura paying to Hydra 125% of the Principal Amount (equal to $10,000,000 in the aggregate) on the earlier of December 8, 2023 and five business days after the consummation of the Business Combination.

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
Our Class A Ordinary Shares and Public Warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and as a result we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. The public may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 E Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at: http://www.sec.gov. The contents of this website are not incorporated into this filing. Further, our references to the uniform resource locator (“URL”) for this website are intended to be inactive textual references only.
We will be required to report our evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

​



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the IPO Closing Date, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A Ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
