Item 1. Business



Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the “Company”, “HOFRE,” “we,” “our,” “us” and similar terms refer to Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company, a Delaware corporation.



Overview



We are a resort and entertainment company leveraging the power and popularity of professional football and its legendary players in partnership with the National Football Museum, Inc., doing business as the Pro Football Hall of Fame (“PFHOF”). Headquartered in Canton, Ohio, we own the Hall of Fame Village, a multi-use sports and entertainment destination centered around the PFHOF’s campus. We expect to create a diversified set of revenue streams through developing themed attractions, premier entertainment programming and sponsorships. We are pursuing a differentiation strategy across three pillars, including destination-based assets, the Media Company, and gaming.



The strategic plan has been developed in three phases of growth: Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III. Phase I of the Hall of Fame Village is operational, consisting of the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, the ForeverLawn Sports Complex, and HOF Village Media Group, LLC (“Hall of Fame Village Media” or the “Media Company”). The Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium hosts multiple sports and entertainment events, including the NFL Hall of Fame Game, Enshrinement and Concert for Legends during the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Week. The ForeverLawn Sports Complex hosts camps and tournaments for football players, as well as athletes from across the country in other sports such as lacrosse, rugby and soccer. Hall of Fame Village Media leverages the sport of professional football to produce exclusive programming. For example, licensing the extensive content controlled by the PFHOF as well as new programming assets developed from live events such as youth tournaments, camps and sporting events held at the ForeverLawn Sports Complex and the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.



We are developing new hospitality, attraction and corporate assets as part of our Phase II development plan. Phase II plans for future components of the Hall of Fame Village include two hotels (one on campus and one in downtown Canton that opened in November 2020), the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, the Constellation Center for Excellence (an office building including retail and meeting space, that opened in October 2021), the Center for Performance (a convention center/field house, that opened in October of 2022), the Play Action Plaza (completed in December of 2022), and the Fan Engagement Zone (Retail Promenade), core and shell for Retail I was completed in September of 2022 and the core and shell of Retail II was completed in November of 2022). Phase III expansion plans may include a potential mix of residential space, additional attractions, entertainment, dining, merchandise and more.



Corporate History and Background



The Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company (formerly known as GPAQ Acquisition Holdings, Inc.) was incorporated in Delaware on August 29, 2019, as a subsidiary of Gordon Pointe Acquisition Corp. (“GPAQ”), a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or assets.



On July 1, 2020, we consummated the previously announced business combination with HOF Village, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“HOF Village”), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated September 16, 2019 (as amended on November 6, 2019, March 10, 2020 and May 22, 2020, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among the Company, GPAQ Acquiror Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Acquiror Merger Sub”), GPAQ Company Merger Sub, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Company Merger Sub”), HOF Village and HOF Village Newco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Newco”). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the “Business Combination.”



On September 29, 2022, our stockholders approved an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our shares of Common Stock, and our Board subsequently approved a final reverse stock split ratio of 1-for-22 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective at 12:01am Eastern Time on December 27, 2022 (the “Effective Time”). At the Effective Time, every 22 shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock were combined and converted into one issued and outstanding share of Common Stock. Fractional shares were cancelled and stockholders received cash in lieu thereof. All outstanding restricted stock unit awards, warrants and other securities settled in, exercisable for or convertible into shares of Common Stock were adjusted as a result of the reverse split, as required by their respective terms. A proportionate adjustment was also made to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable under the Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment Company Amended 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The number of authorized shares of Common Stock and the par value per share of Common Stock remains unchanged at $0.0001 per share.



The Reverse Stock Split primarily was intended to bring the Company into compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for maintaining its listing on the Nasdaq. The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder’s percentage interest in the Company’s equity (other than as a result of the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares).

Business Strategy



Our unique position and multimedia approach makes us the only company of our kind fully poised to capitalize on the popularity of professional football, one of the most popular brands in sports worldwide (as measured by total league revenue and number of fans). Our principal business objectives are to successfully develop and operate Destination Based Assets such as the Hall of Fame Village as a premiere destination resort and entertainment company leveraging the expansive popularity of professional football and the Pro Football Hall of Fame; Hall of Fame Village Media taking advantage of direct access to exclusive content; and a gaming vertical that spans across fantasy sports in addition to growth areas of eGaming and sports betting. The resort and entertainment platform will significantly extend the presence of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the singular institution focused on promoting and preserving the legends and values of professional football. We are located in Canton, Ohio, the birthplace of American professional football. It is in a market area with limited themed attractions and within an 8-hour driving distance to nearly half of the NFL franchises. Together with the PFHOF, we intend to become an elite entertainment venue and premier attraction for the region. The current operational assets of the PFHOF and the Company currently attract over two million visitors annually.



Strategic Relationship with PFHOF



PFHOF is a distinct entity from us but serves as a significant shareholder and aligned partner. The Pro Football Hall of Fame, which is owned and operated by PFHOF and not the Company, is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit educational institution that focuses on the education, promotion, preservation and honoring of the individuals and moments that shaped professional football’s history. Since opening in 1963, the Museum has grown in both size and stature. The building was expanded in 1971, 1978 and 1995, and completed major exhibit gallery renovations in 2003, 2008, and 2009. Together, these improvements have transformed the original 19,000 square-foot Hall of Fame museum into an exciting internationally recognized institution and travel destination. The “Future 50” Expansion & Renovation Project has expanded the museum to 118,000 square feet. The two-year, $27 million project was completed in the summer of 2013 after a major renovation to 38,000 square feet of museum space was finished. Today, the Pro Football Hall of Fame stands as a shining tribute to professional football and the over 300 men who have been enshrined, receiving their Gold Jackets. The Pro Football Hall of Fame Museum and the Gold Jacket enshrinees serve as unique and valuable partners that contribute to the development of the Hall of Fame Village.



See the section entitled “Risk Factors – The success of our business is dependent upon the continued success of the PFHOF brand and museum experience and our ability to continue to secure favorable contracts with and maintain a good working relationship with PFHOF and its management team” for additional information relating to the relationship with PFHOF.



About Phase I



We have invested approximately $250 million of capital to build Phase I of the Hall of Fame Village in preparation for Phase II and Phase III. Phase I, already complete, includes the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, the ForeverLawn Sports Complex, Hall of Fame Village Media, complementary, long-term sponsorship agreements, as well as land and infrastructure to support Phase II and Phase III. We are executing strategies to significantly increase programming of the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium and ForeverLawn Sports Complex and developing unique media content through Hall of Fame Village Media.
Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium



The Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium holds up to 23,000 spectators and hosts the annual Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Week as well as other premier sporting events such as the Historic Black College Hall of Fame Game, the Ohio State High School Football Championships, the 2022 USFL Championships, Women’s Football Alliance Championships and Division III football championships. During the Pro Football Hall of Fame Enshrinement Week, the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium hosts the Hall of Fame Game, the first NFL game of the pre-season, and the Hall of Fame Enshrinement for NFL players and other enshrinees. The design of the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium with cut-away seats, allows it to serve as an elite concert venue. The Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium has hosted performances by national recording artists such as Aerosmith, Tim McGraw, Pitbull, Toby Keith, Maroon 5, and Journey as well as comedian Dave Chappelle.
ForeverLawn Sports Complex



The ForeverLawn Sports Complex consists of eight full-sized fields. Support buildings including concessions, ticketing, restrooms and storage buildings were completed in or prior to the third quarter of 2022. The facility hosts camps and tournaments for football players as well as athletes from other sports such as lacrosse, rugby and soccer from across the country.

Hall of Fame Village Media



In 2017, HOF Village formed a sports and entertainment media company, Hall of Fame Village Media, leveraging the sport of professional football to produce exclusive content, including content developed from live events such as tournaments, camps and sporting events held at the ForeverLawn Sports Complex and the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. Hall of Fame Village Media has the ability to serve multiple media formats including full length feature films, live and taped television specials, studio shows, live sports events, books and artwork. Through our partnership with the PFHOF, Hall of Fame Village Media has access to millions of pieces of photo, video and document archives.



In 2021, Hall of Fame Village Media began developing and selling Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs”), with initial launch focused on memorable plays from college and professional careers of six legendary football players. In 2022, we launched Hall of Fame Village Passes, enabling passholders access to exclusive experiences, community and digital collectables.



In 2021, Hall of Fame Village Media co-produced the World Chase Tag primetime special on ESPN, which was also hosted at the Hall of Fame Village. In 2022, we produced in partnership with PFHOF, the Football Heaven podcast, the 10-episode series highlighting the collection of the museum’s archives and stories.



During 2022, Hall of Fame Village Media co-produced Inspired, a series celebrating inspirational NFL figures who have used their platform to help those in need while uniting communities. Inspired aired on over 100 Gray Television local channels



Also during 2022, Hall of Fame Village Media co-produced The Perfect 10, a documentary film profiling the exclusive group of NFL athletes who are both Heisman Trophy winners and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees. We sold The Perfect 10 to Fox, where it aired across the country on Fox stations during Super Bowl weekend.



Hall of Fame Village Media also has entered into a number of partnership deals with Hall of Fame and other NFL players including Jimmy Johnson and Rashad Jennings



Sponsorship Agreements



We are bringing together world-class sponsors and partners. To date, we have struck formal agreements related to sponsorship alliances for development support from best-in-class companies, including Johnson Controls, the founding partner and official naming rights partner, Constellation NewEnergy, Inc., the official energy partner, First Data Merchant Services, LLC (now Fiserv), the official processing and payment solutions partner, ForeverLawn, the official artificial turf partner, PepsiCo, our official soft drink provider, Commscope, the official data communications networking partner, and Cleveland Clinic, the official healthcare provider of ForeverLawn Sports Complex and the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.



Generally, under the terms of our sponsorship agreements, we will receive a fixed amount of revenue each year in exchange for granting certain rights to the relevant sponsor. The revenue may consist of a combination of cash, in-kind and/or activation funds. However, in some cases, the sponsorship fee may consist of a fixed initial payment with variable annual payments thereafter, based on our completion of certain projects or fulfillment of certain requirements.



See the section entitled “Risk Factors – We partially rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenue” for additional information.

About Phase II



Phase II is expected to add additional strategic attractions, hospitality, and corporate assets in a well-planned and synergistic manner intended to increase consumer appeal and drive revenue and profitability growth. The Company has made material progress toward the full execution of Phase II.



To date, either through ground leases, purchase agreements, or through acquisition of title, the Company has acquired all land and received zoning approval from the City of Canton for the development of Phase II. The Company has gained control of over 200 parcels of land surrounding the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, ForeverLawn Sports Complex, and Pro Football Hall of Fame Museum for the future development of the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, on-campus hotel attached to the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, the Fan Engagement Zone (retail promenade) offering a variety of food and beverage options, as well as other specialized entertainment alternatives, and Play Action Plaza, a football-themed area for recreation and events which includes two amusement rides. The Company has commissioned and completed three separate Phase I Environmental Site Assessments on land underlying the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, ForeverLawn Sports Complex and residential land acquired for Phase II of the development plan. To date, no recognized environmental conditions have been revealed.



In addition, we have made significant progress in the construction for Phase II. Phase II is projected to cost approximately $355 million in capital spending. We have made significant progress in opening many of our Phase II assets, including the ForeverLawn Sports Complex, the Constellation Center for Excellence, the Fan Engagement Zone, Play Action Plaza, and the Center for Performance. The expectation is that the remaining components (notably the Hilton Tapestry Hotel and the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark) will be completely operational by the end of the 2024 calendar year.



In Phase II, the critical business strategies are to drive further asset development, increased event programming, new alliance sponsorships, media development and explore additional growth verticals:




● | Further Asset Development: We are constructing additional assets in Phase II to attract and entertain guests. We have acquired or entered into agreements to acquire all land needed for Phase II development and have completed all of the design and development. In November 2020, we opened the DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in downtown Canton. Additional assets will include the Hall of Fame Indoor Waterpark, an on-campus hotel attached to the waterpark. The Fan Engagement Zone (retail promenade) offering a variety of food and beverage options, as well as other specialized entertainment alternatives. In October 2021, we opened our Constellation Center for Excellence. In November 2022, we opened the Center for Performance, which provides a variety of year-round programming options. A green space area called Play-Action Plaza provides 3.5 acres for fun, football-themed recreation, events, and formal gatherings including amusement rides. Future destination-themed assets can include live entertainment, gaming, dining, and more all over the country alongside major NFL franchise cities. Construction began on Phase II in 2020, and all assets are projected to be operational by the end of 2024.

● | Increased Event Programming: We are planning to utilize the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium for an expanded offering of live entertainment and events, including top performers, sporting events and festival programming. Also, given the appeal and popularity of youth sports, additional year-round programming is expected to be available across multiple sports utilizing the national appeal of the Hall of Fame brand. HOF Village has made key strategic hires and partnerships who will help drive increased Event Programming and Alliance Sponsorships. In November 2022, we opened our Center for Performance, our indoor sports dome, which will allow us to host sports and other events year-round. During 2022, we hosted the USFL finals and semi-finals, Women’s Football Alliance Championships, Freedom Bowl, along with a “Fatherhood Festival”. There are also plans for multiple concerts, multi-day festivals, and on-going business event productions.

● | New Alliance Sponsorships: We have been successful attracting a strong sponsorship base and will continue to seek significant partnerships with leading companies and brands across a range of untapped categories. These partnerships are expected to be in the form of naming rights agreements or additional category-specific sponsorships. HOF Village plans to target a number of industry verticals for additional sponsorship revenue, such as financial services, autos, telecom and beverages.

● | Media Development: We are developing original content from both its event programming and its direct access to millions of pieces of historic Pro Football artifacts located within the PFHOF archive through Hall of Fame Village Media. We are planning on producing full-length films, shows and other digital content marketing through multiple channels of distribution. Already advanced discussions with media leaders, creative, development and distribution partners have occurred. We are working on expanding our team and partnerships and have a robust slate of new content in development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hall of Fame Village Gaming: Gaming is expected to be a connective tissue that integrates the rest of the business units across the Company. This encompasses Youth Sports as a way to increase engagement, as well as gaming as a part of offsite asset building and programming, purpose-driven physical destination resort locations, and broadcast/streaming gaming content within media. We entered the high-growth vertical of fantasy sports with the launch of the Hall of Fantasy League in Fall 2021, which completed its second season in January 2023, with geo-based franchises professionally managed with ownership and influence from the public. In connection with our second season of Hall of Fantasy League, we also launched Legends Locker Room, a paid fantasy data service. There is potential for industry expertise to be provided by experienced fantasy analysts, and NFL Hall of Famers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sports Betting: We procured two sports betting licenses to develop sports betting both online and on campus in connection with sports betting legislation in the State of Ohio. In 2023, our mobile betting partner, Betr, went live offering both monetary and token (free-to-play) microbets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring Additional Growth Verticals: HOF Village has begun exploring additional growth verticals as part of Phase II. There also are expected to be opportunities to consider expanding certain destination-based assets in other geographic markets leveraging the popularity of professional football. We have hired several additional full-time employees to actively research these and other growth verticals. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About Phase III



With Phase I and Phase II assets providing a solid foundation, growth is expected to continue with the development of Phase III, including a potential mix of residential space, and additional attractions, entertainment, dining, merchandise and more. This next phase of development would potentially be initiated upon substantial completion of Phase II.
Competition



We currently face and will face competition in each of our businesses, as follows:




● | Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, the ForeverLawn Sports Complex and the Center for Performance will compete with other facilities and venues across the region and country for hosting concerts, athletic events (including professional sports events, sports camps and tournaments) and other major conventions.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employees

Properties



We own real property in Canton, Ohio, at the site of the Hall of Fame Village development and our DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel. Certain parcels of real property on which the Hall of Fame Village is located, including the parcel on which Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium is located, are owned by the Canton City School District (Board of Education), and are subject to long-term ground leases and agreements with us for the use and development of such property.
Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company



We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.



Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a registration statement under the Securities Act declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company that has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.



We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Company’s initial public offering on January 30, 2018, (b) in which we have total annual revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common equity that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of any fiscal year for so long as either (1) the market value of our shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues did not equal or exceed $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates did not equal or exceed $700 million as of the prior June 30.



The COVID-19 Pandemic



Since 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 and the measures to prevent its spread impacted our business in a number of ways, most significantly with regard to a reduction in the number of events and attendance at events at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium and ForeverLawn Sports Complex, which negatively impacts our ability to sell sponsorships. Also, we opened our newly renovated DoubleTree by Hilton in Canton in November 2020, which negatively impacted the occupancy rates by the pandemic, most recently with the Omicron variant in first quarter of 2022. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused global supply chain disruptions, which negatively impacts our ability to obtain the materials needed to complete construction. The impact of these disruptions and the extent of their adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals’ and companies’ risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward and developing strain mutations.

Recent Developments



Dispute Regarding Naming Rights Agreement with Johnson Controls



The amended and restated sponsorship and naming rights agreement, dated as of July 2, 2020 (the “Naming Rights Agreement”), by and among HOF Village, PFHOF and Johnson Controls, Inc. (“JCI” or “Johnson Controls”) is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2034 but provides termination rights both to (a) HOF Village Newco, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Newco”), and PFHOF; and (b) Johnson Controls, which may be exercised in the event the other party, among other things, breaches any of its covenants and agreements under the Naming Rights Agreement beyond certain notice and cure periods. Additionally, Johnson Controls has a right to terminate the Naming Rights Agreement if (i) we do not provide evidence to Johnson Controls by October 31, 2021, that we have secured sufficient debt and equity financing to complete Phase II, subject to day-for-day extensions due to force majeure and notice or cure periods; (ii) Phase II is not open for business by January 2, 2024, subject to day-for-day extensions due to force majeure and notice or cure periods; or (iii) Newco is in default beyond applicable notice and cure periods under certain agreements, such as the Technology as a Service Agreement with Johnson Controls (the “TAAS Agreement”), among others. In addition, under the Naming Rights Agreement, Johnson Controls’ obligation to make sponsorship payments to Newco may be suspended if Newco has not provided evidence reasonably satisfactory to Johnson Controls on or before December 31, 2020, that Newco has secured sufficient debt and equity financing to complete Phase II, subject to day-for-day extensions due to force majeure. 



In addition to the Naming Rights Agreement, Newco is party to a Technology as a Service Agreement dated October 9, 2020 with Johnson Controls (the "TAAS Agreement”).The TAAS Agreement provides that Johnson Controls will provide certain services related to the construction and development of the Hall of Fame Village (the “Project”). The TAAS Agreement provides that in respect of the Naming Rights Agreement, Johnson Controls and Newco intend, acknowledge and understand that: (i) Newco’s performance under the TAAS Agreement is essential to, and a condition to Johnson Controls’ performance under, the Naming Rights Agreement; and (ii) Johnson Controls’ performance under the Naming Rights Agreement is essential to, and a condition to Newco’s performance under, the TAAS Agreement. In the TAAS Agreement, Johnson Controls and Newco represent, warrant and agree that the transactions agreements and obligations contemplated under the TAAS Agreement and the Naming Rights Agreement are intended to be, and shall be, interrelated, integrated and indivisible, together being essential to consummating a single underlying transaction necessary for the Project. We anticipate that resolution of the dispute regarding the Naming Rights Agreement will include the TAAS Agreement. 



On May 10, 2022, we received from Johnson Controls a notice of termination (the “TAAS Notice”) of the TAAS Agreement effective immediately. The TAAS Notice states that termination of the TAAS Agreement by Johnson Controls is due to our alleged breach of our payment obligations. Additionally, Johnson Controls in the TAAS Notice demands the amount which is the sum of: (i) all past due payments and any other amounts owed by us under the TAAS Agreement; (ii) all commercially reasonable and documented subcontractor breakage and demobilization costs; and (iii) all commercially reasonable and documented direct losses incurred by Johnson Controls directly resulting from the alleged default by us and the exercise of Johnson Controls’ rights and remedies in respect thereof, including reasonable attorney fees.

Also on May 10, 2022, we received from Johnson Controls a notice of termination (“Naming Rights Notice”) of the Name Rights Agreement, effective immediately. The Naming Rights Notice states that the termination of the Naming Rights Agreement by Johnson Controls is due to Johnson Controls’ concurrent termination of the TAAS Agreement. The Naming Rights Notice further states that we must pay Johnson Controls, within 30 days following the date of the Naming Rights Notice, $4,750,000. We have not made such payment to date. The Naming Rights Notice states that we are also in breach of its covenants and agreements, which required us to provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to Johnson Controls on or before October 31, 2021, subject to day-for-day extensions due to force majeure, that we have secured sufficient debt and equity financing to complete Phase II.



We dispute that we are in default under either the TAAS Agreement or the Naming Rights Agreement. Rather, we believe Johnson Controls is in breach of the Naming Rights Agreement and the TAAS Agreement due to their failure to make certain payments in accordance with the Naming Rights Agreement, and, on May 16, 2022, provided notice to Johnson Controls of these breaches. 



Pursuant to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in the Naming Rights Agreement, the parties participated in mediation in November 2022, but were unable to reach a resolution. On January 24, 2023, Newco filed a demand for arbitration with JAMS, asserting claims against JCI for breach of contract, breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. On February 16, 2023, JCI filed its response, generally denying Newco’s allegations and asserting counterclaims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment. A panel of three arbitrators will be constituted to hear and determine the dispute. The ultimate outcome of this dispute cannot presently be determined. However, in management’s opinion, the likelihood of a material adverse outcome is remote. Accordingly, adjustments, if any, that might result from the resolution of this matter have not been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company suspended its revenue recognition until the dispute is resolved and has recorded an allowance against the amounts due as of December 31, 2022 in the amount of $4,812,500. The balances due under the Naming Rights Agreement as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 amounted to $6,635,417 and $1,885,417, respectively.

Compliance with Nasdaq Minimum Bid Requirement



As previously reported, on May 24, 2022, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the “Staff”) of the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that for the last 30 consecutive business days the bid price for the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), had closed below the minimum requirement for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Requirement”).



On December 27, 2022, we effected the Reverse Stock Split to, among other things, increase our stock price to be in compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement.



On January 11, 2023, the Company received written notice from the Staff of Nasdaq informing the Company that it has regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement because Nasdaq has determined that for 10 consecutive business days, the closing bid price of the Company’s Common Stock was at or above the Minimum Bid Requirement. Accordingly, Nasdaq has advised that the matter is now closed.

$18,100,000 principal amount Tax Increment Financing (“TIF”) Revenue Bonds



On February 2, 2023, the Company received proceeds from the issuance on such date by Stark County Port Authority (“Port Authority”) of $18,100,000 principal amount Tax Increment Financing (“TIF”) Revenue Bonds, Series 2023 (“2023 Bonds”). Of the $18,100,000 principal amount, approximately $6,767,543 was used to reimburse the Company for a portion of the cost of certain roadway improvements within the Hall of Fame Village grounds, approximately $8,628,502 was used to pay off the Development Finance Authority of Summit County (“DFA”) Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 ( “2018 Bonds”) that had been acquired by the Company in December 2022 pursuant to a previously disclosed arrangement (such that the Company received the payoff of the 2018 Bonds), approximately $1,169,916 was used to pay costs of issuance of the 2023 Bonds, and approximately $905,000 was used to fund a debt service reserve held by The Huntington National Bank (“2023 Bond Trustee”), as trustee for the 2023 Bonds. The maturity date of the 2023 Bonds is December 30, 2048. The interest rate on the 2023 Bonds is 6.375%. Interest payments are due on the 2023 Bonds semi-annually on June 30 and December 30 of each year, commencing June 30, 2023.



In connection with the issuance of the 2023 Bonds by the Port Authority, the Company transferred ownership of a portion of the roadway and related improvements within Hall of Fame Village grounds to the Port Authority. The Company maintains management rights and maintenance obligations with regard to such roadway pursuant to a Maintenance and Management Agreement among the Port Authority, the Company and the Company’s subsidiary, Newco.



The 2023 Bonds will be repaid by the Port Authority from statutory service payments in lieu of taxes paid by the Company in connection with the Company’s Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, ForeverLawn Sports Complex, Constellation Center for Excellence, Center for Performance, Retail I property, Retail II property, Play Action Plaza and an interior private roadway, net of the portion payable to Canton City School District and Plain Local School District and net of administrative fees of Stark County and the City of Canton, and from minimum service payments levied against those parcels excluding the Stadium and Youth Fields. Net statutory service payments are assigned by the City of Canton to the Port Authority for payment of the 2023 Bonds pursuant to a Cooperative Agreement among the Port Authority, City of Canton, the Company and Newco, and then pledged by the Port Authority to the 2023 Bond Trustee for payment of the 2023 Bonds pursuant to a Trust Indenture between the Port Authority and the 2023 Bond Trustee. Minimum service payments are a lien on the parcels under certain TIF declarations and supplements thereto, and are paid by the Company to the 2023 Bond Trustee.



The Company and Newco are required to make payments (“Developer Shortfall Payments”) to the extent the above described net statutory service payments and minimum service payments actually paid are not sufficient to pay the scheduled debt service on the 2023 Bonds, and entered into a guaranty of payment of minimum service payments under a Minimum Payment Guaranty until certain performance criteria (debt service coverage of 1.05x for the 2023 Bonds for three consecutive years) are met. In addition, a member of the Company’s board of directors, Stuart Lichter, individually and with his trust, guaranteed Developer Shortfall Payments until debt service coverage of 1.0x for the 2023 Bonds for three consecutive years are met.



To the extent statutory service payments and minimum service payments exceed the amounts required for debt service on the 2023 Bonds, the excess paid will first increase and/or restore the 2023 Bonds fund reserve to a maximum of 10% of the original principal amount of the 2023 Bonds (i.e. $1,810,000) and then to redeem the 2023 Bonds, with the amount paid applied to the principal balance of the 2023 Bonds. The 2023 Bonds fund reserve (initially 5% (i.e., $905,000) subject to increase up to 10%) mentioned above will be maintained to be used for payment of debt service and administrative fees if there are insufficient funds generated from the statutory service payments, minimum service payments and Developer Shortfall Payments, and, to the extent unused, make the final 2023 Bonds payment of debt service.

On March 17, 2023, pursuant to the IRG Letter Agreement the Company and certain of its subsidiaries signed amendments to (a) certain IRG Affiliate Lender credit arrangements (and entered into backup notes for two credit arrangements) and (b) warrants issued by the Company held by IRG Affiliate Lenders (collectively, defined as Transaction Documents below), effective as of November 7, 2022 (unless otherwise noted), as consideration for the IRG Financial Support. In particular, the Company amended the Series C through Series F warrants issued by the Company held by IRG Affiliate Lenders and, upon approval of the Company’s stockholders under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c), will amend the Series G warrant, as follows: (i) the exercise price of the Series C through Series G warrants held by IRG Affiliate Lenders is reset to a price equal to 105% of the average Nasdaq official closing price of the Company’s Common Stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Oak Street closing of November 7, 2022, which price is $0.58 per share prior to the Reverse Stock Split (the “Market Price”); and (ii) the warrant expiration dates of the Series C through Series G warrants held by IRG Affiliate Lenders are extended by two years from their current expiration dates. In addition, the Company amended certain IRG Affiliate Lender credit arrangements (and entered into backup notes for two credit arrangements) that are Transaction Documents as follows: (i) all IRG Affiliate Lender loans bear interest at 12.5% per annum, compounded monthly, with payment required monthly at 8% per annum, and with the remaining interest accrued and deferred until maturity; (ii) the price at which the principal and accumulated and unpaid interest under the IRG Affiliated Lender loans is convertible into shares of Common Stock is reset to a price equal to Market Price, subject in the case of loans to which Midwest Lender Fund, LLC is a party to approval of the Company’s stockholders under Nasdaq 5635(c); (iii) the Company and certain subsidiaries entered into a backup promissory note with each of JKP Financial, LLC and Midwest Lender Fund, LLC that provide benefits incremental to and offset by existing notes with such lenders; (iv) the Company agreed to acknowledge an existing pledge of the Company’s 100% membership interest in Newco and reflect that such pledge secures all amounts due under the IRG Affiliate Lender loans; (v) certain IRG Affiliate Lender loans were cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted; (vi) the Company and its subsidiaries covenanted not to assign, pledge, mortgage, encumber or hypothecate any of the underlying assets, membership interests in affiliated entities or intellectual property rights without the written consent of IRG Affiliate Lenders; (vii) prior development fees owed by the Company to IRG Affiliate Lenders were accrued and added to the Bridge Loan, and future development fees owed by the Company to IRG Affiliate Lenders will be paid as when due; and (viii) the Company agreed to pay to IRG Affiliate Lenders 25% of all contractual dispute cash settlements collected by the Company with regard to existing contractual disputes in settlement discussions, which shall be applied to outstanding IRG Affiliate Lender loans, first against accrued interest and other charges and then against principal.



The amendment and restatement of the Series C through Series F warrants held by IRG Affiliate Lenders and the IRG Affiliate Lender loans (and entering into the two backup notes) and, upon approval of the Company’s stockholders under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c), the Series G warrant and the effectiveness of the conversion provision in the backup promissory note issued to Midwest Lender Fund, LLC, are transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Each of the IRG Affiliate Lenders has represented to the Company that it is an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Transaction Documents (defined below), the Company and the IRG Affiliate Lenders agreed that the total cumulative number of additional shares of Common Stock that may be issued to the IRG Affiliate Lenders under the Transaction Documents may not exceed the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) (“Nasdaq 19.99% Cap”), except that such limitation will not apply following Approval (defined below). If the number of shares of Common Stock issued to the IRG Affiliate Lenders under the Transaction Documents reaches the Nasdaq 19.99% Cap, so as not to violate the 20% limit established in Listing Rule 5635(d), the Company, at its election, will use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain stockholder approval of the Transaction Documents and the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock thereunder, if necessary, in accordance with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d) (the “Approval”). For purposes hereof, “Transaction Documents” means the second amended and restated Series C warrant (Exhibit 4.7 to this Form 10-K), the second amended and restated Series D Warrant (Exhibit 4.8 to this Form 10-K), the two amended and restated Series E warrants (Exhibits 4.9 and 4.10 to this Form 10-K), the two amended and restated Series F warrants (Exhibits 4.11 and 4.12 to this Form 10-K), the amended and restated Series G warrant (Exhibit 4.13 to this Form 10-K), the joinder and second amended and restated secured cognovit promissory note issued to JKP Financial, LLC (Exhibit 10.41 to this Form 10-K), the joinder and second amended and restated secured cognovit promissory note issued to IRG, LLC (Exhibit 10.40 to this Form 10-K), the backup joinder and first amended and restated secured cognovit promissory note with JKP Financial, LLC (Exhibit 10.23 to this Form 10-K), the amendment number 8 to term loan agreement (Exhibit 10.36 to this Form 10-K), the second amended and restated secured cognovit promissory note issued to CHCL in connection with the term loan agreement, the fourth amendment to and spreader of the pledge and security agreement under the term loan agreement, the second amendment to and spreader of the mortgage under the term loan agreement, the joinder and first amended and restated secured cognovit bridge promissory note issued to CHCL (Exhibit 10.50 to this Form 10-K), and the backup promissory note issued to Midwest Lender Fund, LLC (Exhibit 10.49 to this Form 10-K).



Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c), stockholder approval is required prior to the issuance of Common Stock in connection with certain non-public offerings involving the sale, issuance or potential issuance by a listed company of equity compensation. For this purpose, “equity compensation” includes Common Stock (and/or securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock) issued to our officers, directors, employees or consultants at a discount to the market value of the Common Stock, and “market value” is the closing bid price immediately preceding the time that the listed company enters into a binding agreement with such officer, director, employee or consultant to issue the equity compensation. Midwest Lender Fund, LLC is wholly-owned by our director Stuart Lichter. The amended and restated Series G warrant issued to Midwest Lender Fund, LLC and the backup promissory note issued to Midwest Lender Fund, LLC do not become effective unless and until approved by stockholders of the Company under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c).
