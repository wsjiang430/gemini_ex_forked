Those changes in management occurred to promote, operate and expand our new business with management specific knowledge. At the time of appointment of the new directors, Thenablers issued to Konstantinos Galanakis, Stavros Galanakis, Aikaterini Galanaki and Theodoros Chouliaras an aggregate of 80,000,000 shares of newly designated “Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $30,000 and the transfer of all of the business of Elvictor Crew Management Ltd to the Company, including all existing crew management contracts, the transfer of which began in the fourth quarter of 2020 and concluded at the end of 2021.

Our Services



Crewing and Crew Management Services



Crewing is a key ship management service and is defined as the selection, recruitment and training of the essential on-board crews. Crew managers source crew members for particular periods considering the specific needs on-board our clients’ vessels, the availability of crew members at the location of the vessels, and the vessels’ schedules.



We provide services that cover various types of crew management activities, including sourcing and preliminary screening of seafarers, the matching of crew members with ship owning companies, and submission of employment proposals. We also direct seafarers to health clinics, record in our databases the results of their medical examinations thereby helping verify that the seafarers are fit and ready to perform their assignments. We also maintain records of the travel and Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (“STCW”) documents which are required for the seafarers to board our clients’ vessels and perform services thereon. This is a highly complex procedure, given the number of seafarers handled on a daily basis, and requires us to process and store sensitive information (such as, but not limited to, the health records of the seafarers). Because of this, we are obligated to comply with data privacy regulations in the United States, as well as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of the EU.



We brief the seafarers on the details of their new assignment to ensure their familiarization with their respective tasks, after which we make the necessary travel arrangements, including booking of tickets, to ensure that the seafarers reach their destination port and embark the vessel safely and in a timely manner. Upon completion of the assigned trip, each seafarer undergoes a disembarkation and briefing procedure, during which seafarers may submit complaints related to previous assignments, state whether they would like to rejoin the specific ship company for further assignments, request to be promoted and/or effectively communicate any other issues.



For each of the aforementioned services, we charge our clients a fee based on the salary of each seafarer, the seafarer’s rank, and the type of the vessel in which the seafarer is employed (i.e. bulker, tanker, liquefied petroleum gas tanker or container ship). Most of our revenues are recognized under long-term contracts, including those for which revenues are based on either a fixed price, or cost-plus-fee basis, and primarily as performance obligations are satisfied. Revenue from crew manning and management services where we act as a principle is recognized as gross revenue and when acting as an agent, revenue is recognized as net revenue in the accounting period in which the services are rendered.



Until the first quarter of 2022, we outsourced the provision of crewing and crew management services to Elvictor Crew Management Ltd, our related party based in Cyprus. In April 2022, we reduced the amount of crewing and crew management services that we outsource by providing such services directly through our subsidiaries. Our wholly owned subsidiary ELVG Crew Management Ltd, was formed in January of 2022 with the intent of providing such services through this subsidiary.

Ship Management Services



Ship management services include the technical and financial fleet management, the crew management and procurement process, as well as compliance with quality and safety standards:




● | The technical management includes the maintenance of the machinery and repair work of the ship to ensure the technical availability of the vessel. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Crew management is also a key ship management service and refers to the recruitment, composition and employment of the essential on-board crews. Ship managers hire crew members for particular periods considering the specific needs on-board, the availability of crew members at the location of the vessel and the vessel schedules. 
● | Financial management includes finance and accounting, provision of data and performance measurement of the vessel. 
● | Finally, ship managers provide spare parts, supplies and services to keep the vessel ready to sail, and also arrange compliance with regulations and quality standards, health, safety and environment standards, insurance and claims handling services. 




We intend to expand our services by also providing ship management services and in furtherance of this plan, we acquired Ultra Shipmanagement from Stavros Galanakis and Konstantinos Galanakis, which has received its Det Norske Veritas AS approved Interim Document of Compliance provided under the authority granted by the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and we have also employed specialized personnel. The Interim Document of Compliance is the license required for a ship management company to start providing its services.



Competition



Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and operational resources, longer operating histories, greater marketing and advertising capabilities, and broader geographic presence than we and our subsidiaries do. Our competitors may be better positioned to outmaneuver us in the market by offering more competitive pricing and by spending significantly greater resources on advertising. Our current and potential competitors may be able to expand into markets in which we and our subsidiaries currently operate, and we and our subsidiaries are vulnerable to the marketing power and potentially significantly higher level of customer brand recognition of our larger competitors. Many of our competitors offer services that are more extensive than the services we together with our subsidiaries currently offer and may offer such services at a price point that we may be unable to compete with.



Our competitors in ship and crew management can be separated into three broad categories:




(a) | Local manning companies focused on specific geographical markets situated in their countries of domicile (Ukraine, Sri Lanka, Philippines, etc.), which provide isolated services encompassing ship personnel. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) | In-house ship and crew management departments of ship owning companies that usually own a substantial number of vessels. 
(c) | Crew & Ship management companies providing crew management services to third parties. 




We believe that we can compete effectively with our competitors through:




(i) | Our access to seafarer-supplying countries, through established relations with related or third-party companies;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Our smaller size and simpler internal structure can be more flexible to the specific requirements of each client and can offer a tailor-made approach both in the services and pricing allowing to present an attractive alternative solution to many larger ship owning companies;
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Our crew management platform designed to allow our personnel to collaborate with different cultures in different time zones with ever rising complexities, presenting a uniform service level to our clients regardless of the point of origin of the crew; and
------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | Our public status that provides transparency to our operations and financial performance covering our clients ESG requirements.
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




As we grow our operations and venture into new products and solutions, we anticipate competitive pressures to increase, particularly from established firms that find our solutions disruptive.
