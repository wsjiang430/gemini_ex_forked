ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of anti-purinergic drug therapies (“APT”) for the treatment of disorders with intractable neurologic symptoms, ranging from neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (“ASD”), to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (“ME/CFS”), a debilitating physical and cognitive disorder believed to be viral in origin and now with rising incidence globally due to the long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 (“COVID-19”). APTs have been shown to block the effects of excess production and extracellular receptor activity of adenosine triphosphate (“ATP”), which acts as both the main energy molecule in all living cells and a peripheral and central nervous system neurotransmitter via receptors that are found throughout the nervous system. Excess purinergic signaling can offset homeostasis and trigger immune responses that result in localized and systemic increases in inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, ultimately stimulating ATP production. APTs may also impact immunologic and inflammatory mechanisms that may be causing or exacerbating symptoms in these seemingly unrelated disorders, which may be caused in part by similar mechanisms of ATP overproduction.
One of our primary points of focus is currently the development and testing of our lead program, PAX-101, an intravenous formulation of suramin, in the treatment of ASD and the advancement of the clinical understanding of using that agent against other disorders such as ME/CFS and Long COVID-19 Syndrome (“LCS”), a clinical diagnosis in individuals who have been previously infected with COVID-19. In February 2021, we announced positive topline data from our Phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial evaluating PAX-101 (commonly known as intravenous suramin) for the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD, as described in more detail below. We also intend to submit data to support a New Drug Application (an “NDA”) for PAX-101 under the Tropical Disease Priority Voucher Program of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for the treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis, a fatal parasitic infection commonly known as African sleeping sickness (“HAT”), leveraging suramin’s historical use in treating HAT outside of the United States. We have exclusively licensed clinical data from certain academic or international government institutions to potentially accelerate PAX-101’s development plans in the United States through this regulatory program and seek approval in the United States for the treatment of East African HAT (as defined below) as early as 2024. We are also pursuing the development of next generation APT product development candidates for neurodevelopmental indications. These candidates include PAX-102, our proprietary intranasal formulation of suramin, as well as other new chemical entities that are more targeted and selective antagonists of particular purine receptor subtypes. We believe our lead drug candidate (suramin), if approved by the FDA, may be a significant advancement in the treatment of ASD and a potentially useful treatment for ME/CFS and LCS.

Our Development Strategy
Current Clinical Development Plan
Our clinical development plan seeks to obtain initial U.S. approval of PAX-101 for the treatment of East African HAT, which is caused by the parasite Trypanosome brucei rhodesiense, and, using the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, leverage such approval, if achieved, to facilitate an accelerated development program for PAX-101 for certain neurologic indications including ASD, ME/CFS and LCS. Based on our pre-IND meeting with the FDA in March 2021 and, in part, on an analysis of the data that we have exclusively licensed from the Ministry of Health, Republic of Malawi and Lwala Hospital (Soroti, Uganda) relative to East African HAT patients treated with suramin, we believe we have created a strong development strategy that we plan to employ in seeking the approval of PAX-101 for the treatment of East African HAT. Based on our prior interactions with the FDA, including our pre-IND meeting with the FDA, we further believe that an approval, if any, in East African HAT could confer upon us the potential receipt of a priority review voucher (“PRV”) by the FDA, which we could potentially monetize to fund our future clinical programs. We expect further clinical studies of PAX-101 for the treatment of ASD, ME/CFS and LCS will be required and similar clinical development is needed for PAX-102 to reach the commercial stage. In November 2020, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to PAX-101 for the treatment of East African HAT. However, there can be no assurance that we will receive FDA approval for PAX-101 for the treatment of East African HAT and, even if PAX-101 is approved by the FDA, there can be no assurance that we will receive a PRV. For more information on the PRV process and how we may benefit from it, see the section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. “Item 1. Business – Governmental Regulation - The Priority Review Voucher Program.”

Development Pipeline
The following table summarizes our current product candidate and indication pipeline.

PAX-101 (intravenous suramin)
Our lead product candidate under development is PAX-101, an intravenous formulation of suramin, which we are developing for multiple indications, including East African HAT, ASD, ME/CFS, and LCS.
The most advanced indication for which we are developing PAX-101 is for treatment of “Stage 1” Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (East African) HAT, the stage of the clinical course of HAT in which the parasite is found in the peripheral circulation, but it has not yet infiltrated the CNS. We maintain exclusively licensed worldwide rights to patient-level data on the use of suramin in the treatment of Stage 1 East African HAT, which we intend to leverage for demonstration of the safety and efficacy of PAX-101. We have met with the FDA in two formal meetings regarding the execution and development of PAX-101 for this indication. Pursuant to those conversations, and to satisfy the FDA’s requirement of demonstrating substantial effectiveness, rather than conducting new prospective clinical trials, we intend to complete an analysis and presentation of retrospective data from East African HAT patients previously treated with suramin from 2000 to 2020, for which we have the exclusive license. In addition to these retrospective data, we will also conduct preclinical and clinical safety studies to support submission of an NDA for PAX-101’s East African HAT indication. We expect that such work will be completed over the next 16 months, with the intention of filing an NDA in 2024. Additionally, we are developing a proprietary supply chain of drug substance and drug product which will form the basis of our NDA filing. Without establishing this supply chain, we will not be able to submit an NDA for the East African HAT indication. See “Manufacturing” for additional information about our expected timeline for establishing our supply chain. In November 2020, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to PAX-101 for the treatment of East African HAT. It is expected that PAX-101, if approved by the FDA for the East African HAT indication, will qualify for new chemical entity exclusivity (providing sole marketing rights in the United States to the Company with respect to any product that contains suramin for up to seven years), in addition to orphan drug exclusivity, and potentially a tropical disease PRV. However, even if PAX-101 is approved by the FDA for the East African HAT indication, there can be no assurance that we will receive a tropical disease PRV.
Phase 2 Clinical Trial
Our lead neurologic indication for PAX-101 is for use in treating core symptoms of ASD. In 2021, we conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial at six sites in South Africa with respect to this indication (the “Phase 2 Trial”). The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, where we studied two doses of drug versus placebo over a 14-week treatment period. Dosing was at baseline and at the end of weeks 4 and 8. The study population included a patient population with diverse ethnicity and a mean age of approximately 8.4 years. Forty-four of the fifty-two enrolled subjects completed the study, with five withdrawals due to COVID-19 lockdowns, one for an adverse event and three for other reasons. The study evaluated a number of different clinically validated endpoints used in the assessment of the core symptoms of ASD. The primary endpoint of the study was the change between baseline and Week 14 in the 

4



Aberrant Behavior Checklist (“ABC”) composite score of core symptoms (“ABC Core”) including ABC-II (lethargy/social withdrawal), ABC-III (stereotypy) and ABC-V (inappropriate speech).

PAX-101 10mg/kg demonstrated greater improvement through the 14-week treatment period compared to placebo in several assessment measures, including the ABC Core and the Clinical Global Impression - Global Improvement Scale (“CGI-I”). At Week 14, there was a mean improvement from baseline of 12.3 points in the ABC Core in subjects on 10 mg/kg vs. 8.4 points in subjects on placebo (p=0.37). The study was not fully powered for efficacy. However, at Week 14, the subjects treated with 10 mg/kg of PAX-101 demonstrated a mean improvement from baseline in the CGI-I overall symptom severity score of 2.8 points versus 1.7 points on placebo. This change in CGI-I was statistically significant (p=0.016). An improvement in the CGI-I overall symptom severity score of 2 points or more is generally considered to be a clinically relevant change. Certain key subpopulations demonstrated even further improvements on these and other assessments. This trial was designed as a robust dose-ranging study to confirm and expand upon the initial data from a prior-published single dose, single site, pilot study, but was not designed to demonstrate statistical significance across all efficacy endpoints.

We were selected to present the results of the Phase 2 Trial at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry conference Research Pipeline Presentation on October 27, 2021 and are preparing a manuscript with 11 co-authors to submit such data for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The full analysis will include data from primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints evaluated in the trial, safety and laboratory data, and an analysis of the pharmacokinetic data. In July 2021, we completed a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to review the results of this trial where we agreed to obtain additional information about the pharmacokinetic profile of PAX-101 in children in different age groups. We intend to meet with the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) and refine the program’s development plan for global registration based on additional work required. We intend to seek permission from South African regulatory authorities for an additional PAX-101 study in South Africa to develop additional data in younger female subjects and other protocol refinements before submitting an IND to the FDA, which we currently expect to do in 2024. We are also conducting pre-clinical and other required toxicologic studies to support this IND submission.
We are also exploring development of PAX-101 in the treatment of LCS. We have discussed these indication and development plans with our outside scientific advisors and have designed a dose-ranging proof of concept trial design. We received approval from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority and the South African National Health Research Ethics Council for our clinical trial application for a Phase 1B, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple-dose study.
Phase 3 Clinical Trial
In November 2022, we initiated the Phase 3 trial, HAT-301, which is a pivotal, retrospective, controlled analysis of suramin for the treatment of Stage 1 East African HAT. The study is underway at multiple primary HAT treatment sites in Uganda and Malawi. The Phase 3 trial is using exclusively licensed, retrospective clinical data that will be reviewed and compared with a natural history controlled dataset comprised of exclusively licensed source data. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that the standard of care treatment using suramin, as currently practiced in Uganda and Malawi, leads to better clinical outcomes in patients with Stage 1 East African HAT than observed in an untreated natural history cohort, that had documented illness prior to availability of suramin. Top-line data is expected in the second half of 2023.
​
Clinical Trial of Suramin for Management of ASD
In 2017, the Suramin Autism Treatment (“SAT-1”) trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, translational pilot study to examine the safety and activity of low-dose suramin in children with ASD, was completed by Naviaux et al. (2017) at the University of California, San Diego. The study included 10 boys aged 4-17 who lived in the San Diego, California area. None of the boys were less than the 5th percentile in weight for their age, on prescription medications, or had laboratory evidence of liver, kidney, heart, or adrenal abnormalities. Additionally, boys who lived more than 90 minutes from the testing site were excluded from the study to prevent bias due to aberrant behavior resulting from extended travel to and from the University. Boys who had ASD due to a DNA mutation or a chromosomal copy number variation were also excluded from the study. The boys’ parents were instructed to maintain the boys’ current therapies (e.g. supplements, speech, and behavioral therapies) throughout the course of the study.
The trial consisted of a treatment arm of five boys and a placebo arm of five boys. All 10 boys received a 50 mg test dose of suramin in 5 mL of saline or 5 mL of saline only, followed by a 10 mL saline flush. One hour later, boys in the treatment arm received 

6



20 mg/kg of suramin, less the 50 mg test dose, in 50mL of saline, up to a maximum of 1 g, and boys in the placebo arm received 50 mL of saline, each administered intravenously. A 10 mL saline flush followed the second dose’s administration as well.
In the SAT-1 study, the mean age was 9.1 years (range: 5-14 years), the mean nonverbal Leiter IQ was 80 (range: 66-92), and the mean ADOS-2 comparison score was 9.0 (range: 7-10).
No serious toxicities (common terminology criteria for adverse events grades three through five) were encountered. Peripheral neuropathy was not noted in the subject patients. Free cortisol, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelets, liver transaminases, creatinine, and urine protein levels were not statistically significantly different among the boys in the treatment arm and those in the placebo arm.
All five boys who received suramin experienced a self-limited, evanescent, asymptomatic, fine macular, patchy, morbilliform rash over 1%-20% of their body that peaked one day after infusion and disappeared without intervention between days two and four after infusion. No serious adverse events were encountered. On review by an independent data and safety monitoring board, no safety concerns were noted.

Parents reported that, after suramin treatment, the rate of language, social, behavioral, and developmental improvements increased over three weeks, then gradually decreased toward baseline over the next three weeks. ADOS-2 comparison scores at six weeks improved by an average of -1.6 +/- 0.55 points (mean +/- SD; n= 5; 95% CI= -2.3 to -0.9; Cohen’s d = 2.9; P = 0.0028) (note: lower score associated with less concern). The mean ADOS comparison score in the suramin-treated group was 8.6 +/- 0.4 at baseline and 7.0 +/- 0.3 at six weeks. An improvement in ABC, Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist, and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement scores was also noted among boys who received suramin.
PAX-102 (intranasal suramin)
PAX-102, a proprietary intranasal formulation of suramin, is also being developed for neurologic indications. The rationale for this program is the potential to better target the suramin molecule to the CNS, which may potentially allow us to deliver similar potency to that achieved using PAX-101 and reduce the dose needed and improve the tolerability profile of the drug, ultimately offering patients a more convenient delivery system versus intravenous infusion. We have developed a proprietary intranasal formulation, and based on our in vitro nasal membrane permeation studies using the cultured EpiAirway (Mattek) membrane model, as well as more targeted CNS delivery in vivo, we believe our intranasal formulation has the potential to demonstrate rapid and efficient uptake across the nasal membrane. We expect to move forward towards an Investigational New Drug application (an “IND”) on PAX-102 pending further funding or partnerships.
Suramin is not orally bioavailable and has historically been administered intravenously and at very high doses separated by a few days between infusions. Suramin intravenously administered in high doses for treatment and eradication of the parasite that causes East African HAT can cause significant side effects, including rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a feeling of general discomfort. Other side effects include skin sensations such as crawling or tingling sensations, tenderness of the palms and soles, numbness of the extremities, watery eyes, and photophobia. In addition, when administered in high doses or as a continuous infusion, suramin has been shown to cause nephrotoxicity and peripheral neuropathy. Regarding pharmacokinetics, suramin is approximately 99-98% protein bound in the serum and has a half-life of 41-78 days, with an average of 50 days. Also, it is not extensively metabolized and is eliminated by the kidneys.
Despite strong early results from early animal and human studies, we believe more research is needed to provide safe and effective delivery of APTs, such as suramin, for treating neurologic conditions. We believe it may be necessary to deliver appropriate levels of the drug in brain tissue while also minimizing blood and other tissue levels. While it is difficult to deliver drugs across the blood-brain barrier (the “BBB”), which is a natural protective mechanism of most mammals, including humans, such delivery is even more challenging for higher molecular weight compounds, such as suramin. A possible route to maximize delivery across the BBB is to use intranasal delivery to provide higher levels of a drug to the upper nasal mucosa to allow for nose-to-brain transport along the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. We believe our proprietary intranasal formulations and methods of delivering suramin to mammals have been shown, in in-vivo preclinical studies, to deliver suramin to the brain in ways that may reduce systemic exposure, and our development plan calls for clinical trials to test this potential for reduced systemic exposure in humans.
The PAX-101 and PAX-102 development programs in neurologic disorders may be filed with the FDA as a supplement to the initial 505(b)(2) NDA, assuming PAX-101 is approved for the treatment of East African HAT. As discussed in more detail below, a 505(b)(2) NDA is a special type of NDA that enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing or previously approved product, or published literature, in support of its application. 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Using a 505(b)(2) NDA, we expect to reduce the cost, time and risk that would otherwise be associated with bringing these programs to market. See “The 505(b)(2) NDA Regulatory Pathway” below for more information.
Early Program in Selective APTs
In addition to the PAX-101 and PAX-102 development programs, we have begun an early discovery program targeting the development of highly selective APTs. We have identified multiple compounds that are selective for certain purinergic receptor subtypes and have engaged in preclinical work with these compounds in an animal model of ASD. We expect to complete additional preclinical work and open an IND with respect to one or more of these compounds in 2023 or 2024. In the future, we intend to pursue opportunities to develop products, either alone or in partnership with other pharmaceutical companies, related to these APTs.

Our Markets
Market for ASD
According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”), ASD affects between 1% and 2% of the world’s population, including more than 3.5 million people in the United States. Prevalence of autism in eight-year-old U.S. children increased by approximately 243% from 2000 (1 in 150) to 2018 (1 in 44). Autism is the fastest-growing developmental disability, and the annual cost of autism services to U.S. citizens was an estimated $236 to $262 billion in 2016.
No pharmacological therapies exist for the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD, such as lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypy, or repetitive or ritualistic behaviors, and inappropriate speech. Pharmacological therapies that have been approved to date, such as aripiprazole and risperidone, only treat the non-core symptom of irritability associated with ASD. There are also a number of new therapies for ASD in development by small and large companies with variable levels of clinical data, although none has proven efficacy and safety in large, randomized and controlled trials.
The global ASD therapeutics market size was valued at $3.3 billion in 2018, and is expected to reach $4.6 billion by 2026, according to a research report by Fortune Business Insights. We believe a drug that can demonstrate strong safety and efficacy in the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD would generate strong market demand because there are no comprehensive treatment options available to address these important aspects of this condition.
Market for ME/CFS and LCS
It has been estimated by the UK Office of Health Statistics that 13.7% of those who have been confirmed as having been infected with COVID-19 suffer from continuing neurologic symptoms that persist for more than 12 weeks after the viral infection has passed. Some of these LCS symptoms, including fatigue, “brain fog,” pain, sleep disturbances, headaches, anxiety and depression, can become debilitating and recent headlines in the United States and Europe indicate that the population suffering from LCS presents a potential public health crisis that will extend beyond the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, little attention had been paid to a potentially related post-acute infection disorder known as ME/CFS which, in light of the recent observation and identification of LCS, has received renewed interest in the medical and patient advocacy community. Like LCS, ME/CFS sufferers have nearly identical physical symptoms which in extreme cases have been documented to last for years, resulting in affected individuals becoming house-, if not bed-bound. Suicidality is also a common concern of clinicians who care for these patients. The cause of ME/CFS is unknown but research points to the possibility that many cases of ME/CFS resulted from a prior viral infection, which may or may not have had overt physical symptoms at the time, and an immune response to this infection that continues to induce an inflammatory response, despite the lack of any virus or similar infectious invader. Although some ME/CFS sufferers can and do tolerate some ME/CFS symptoms, many seek help through various unproven diets, supplements and prescription drugs. In some cases, complex spinal fusion therapy has been shown to be beneficial for ME/CFS patients whose symptoms may be related to recovery from physical trauma.
There is significant opportunity within the global ME/CFS market. ME/CFS can cause significant impairment and disabilities that have negative economic consequences at both the individual and the societal level. At least one-quarter of ME/CFS patients are house- or bed-bound at some point in their lives. The direct and indirect economic costs of ME/CFS to society have been estimated at $17 to $24 billion annually, $9.1 billion of which has been attributed to lost household and labor force productivity.
The size of the market for LCS is not known. In January 2021, the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) revised its guidelines for COVID-19 treatment to include a recommendation that all patients should have access to follow-up care in case of LCS. As noted above, the UK Office of National Statistics performed a study in over 20,000 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 since April 2020 and found that 13.7% still reported having COVID-19 symptoms after at least 12 weeks. On February 23, 2021, the US National Institutes of Health announced that it would spend $1.15 billion over four years on research on LCS.
Market for East African HAT
The market for using PAX-101 to treat East African HAT is expected to be largely restricted to Sub-Saharan Africa, where suramin is already in use for Stage 1 East African HAT. Further, we may donate product for use in this indication to the WHO, either as a replacement for current limited supplies or as a supplementary source of suramin, if the WHO requests us to do so. If we obtain a U.S. approval for PAX-101 to be used in the treatment of East African HAT, we could potentially qualify to earn a tropical disease PRV from 

9



the FDA, which we would intend to monetize to raise funds to support the later-stage development and commercialization of PAX-101 and PAX-102 in the treatment of ASD, ME/CFS and LCS. The estimated total cost to gain FDA approval, if any, for the HAT indication and qualify for the PRV is estimated to be between $8.0 to $10.0 million, with some portion of these expenses shared across our pipeline indications and formulations programs that would extend beyond the initial HAT approval, if any. There can be no assurance that we will receive a PRV, and even if we do obtain a PRV, there can be no assurance that we will receive sufficient funds from its sale to fund the clinical and commercial development of our drug candidates. If we are unable to obtain a PRV, or if the amount we obtain from its sale is insufficient to fund our operations, we may be required to fund the later-stage development and commercialization of PAX-101 and PAX-102 in the treatment of ASD, ME/CFS and LCS through sales of our equity or debt securities, strategic collaborations with third parties or other similar transactions.
Manufacturing Activities
The synthesis of PAX-101 is a complex multi-step process and involves a global supply chain. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of PAX-101, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing facility for clinical or commercial manufacture of PAX-101 in the foreseeable future. We depend on third-party Contract Manufacturers (“CMOs”) and Contract Laboratories (“CLOs”) to manufacture and test all our critical intermediates, as well as our active pharmaceutical ingredients. We will utilize clinical service organizations to package, label and distribute clinical trial quantities of PAX-101. In 2019 and 2020, we entered into multiple agreements with CMOs for the development and cGMP- compliant production of suramin for use in our clinical trials and to support the future commercial supply chain of PAX-101. Pursuant to these agreements, we have paid upfront fees to our CMOs and will be required to make additional payments upon various milestones throughout the project.

There is no readily available source of suramin for use in clinical trials in the United States. There is currently one manufacturer of suramin, Bayer, which does not manufacture suramin on a regular basis and, when it does, generally only manufactures small quantities in response to outbreaks of HAT. We have engaged two independent contract development manufacturing organizations to develop, validate and scale our supply chain for suramin and the shelf stable drug product that is ultimately distributed to pharmacies. We have completed the necessary steps to begin producing suramin in early 2022 and began the final development phase in April 2022, including the production and final release testing process, that will produce suramin for both clinical and registrational purposes. We have produced suramin API and delivered initial batches for animal testing and we anticipate delivering suramin API for final drug product development in the second quarter of 2023. Development, validation and scaling of the final drug product manufacturing and release process is expected to be initiated in the third quarter of 2023 and drug product is expected to be placed in stability testing immediately following Quality Control release. We estimate expenses required to complete these activities to be between $2.5 million and $2.8 million. We continue to explore alternative manufacturing sources and partnerships in an effort to ensure that we will have an uninterrupted supply chain and maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity in order to meet potential demand for any of our product candidates. We plan to work with our CMOs to establish and safeguard our supply chain for any products we successfully develop. We cannot guarantee, however, that our efforts to develop and maintain such an uninterrupted supply chain will be successful and, until we have a reliable supply, our clinical trial progress will continue to be delayed, including delaying our NDA filing for the HAT indication until we have sufficient supply. Unless and until we can complete the NDA for the HAT indication, we will not be eligible for a priority review voucher.
To comply with FDA requirements for approval of our pharmaceutical products, we will audit all of our CMOs and CLOs to ensure they are compliant with cGMP, including with respect to their document control procedures, manufacturing facilities, environment, and equipment, quality control procedures, quality assurance procedures, and personnel management policies (together, “Quality Systems”). These Quality Systems must be qualified and approved by the FDA prior to approval and release of product on an ongoing basis.
Sales and Marketing
We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to market and sell products that are approved for commercial sale, we must either develop our own sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure or collaborate with third parties that have such commercial infrastructure and relevant marketing and sales experience. We will consider the merits of developing our own sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure for the U.S. market. If we elect to develop our own sales and marketing organization, we do not intend to begin to hire sales and marketing personnel unless and until any of our product candidates are in Phase 3 clinical trials or closer to NDA submission, and we do not intend to establish our own sales organization in the United States unless and until shortly prior to FDA approval of PAX-101 or any of our other product candidates for neurologic indications. We do not intend to establish a sales organization for selling PAX-101 as a treatment for East African HAT in any market. Therefore, at the time of our 

10



anticipated commercial launch of PAX-101, assuming regulatory approval of the drug by the FDA for neurologic indications, any sales and marketing team, if we decide to have one, will have worked together for only a limited period of time.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of these competitors have far greater human and financial resources and may have product candidates in more advanced stages of development. Furthermore, these competitors’ products will likely reach the market before our product candidates. Competitors may also develop products that are more effective or safe, less expensive or that have better tolerability or provide for more convenient administration. Although we believe that our intellectual property, experience and knowledge in our areas of focus provide us with competitive advantages, these potential competitors could reduce our commercial opportunities.
Competition for PAX-101 in ASD
There is currently no known cure for ASD, and no FDA approved medication to treat the core symptoms of ASD. We are aware, however, of several companies that are working to develop drugs that might compete against our product candidates. Our current and potential competitors in ASD include CureMark LLC, which is in Phase 3 studies for CM-AT for ASD, Yamo Pharmaceuticals, which is in Phase 2 studies for LI-79 for ASD, GW Pharmaceuticals, which is in Phase 2 studies for Cannabidivarin for ASD, Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, which is in Phase 2 studies for CBD gel for ASD, QBioMed, which is developing a preclinical asset called QBM-001 for rare pediatric nonverbal ASD, Kuzani Therapeutics, Inc., which has announced that it is in clinical development for the treatment of the core symptoms of ASD in children, and Axial Therapeutics, which is in Phase 2 studies for AB-2004 for irritability in ASD. There are two treatments that have been approved by FDA to treat the non-core symptom of irritability in ASD: Risperdal® (risperidone) and Abilify® (aripiprazole). Both risperidone and aripiprazole are generic medications. For more information relating to competition risks, please see the risk factor with the heading “We face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.”
Competition for PAX-101 in East African HAT
We are not aware of any active development plans by any other companies to slow the progression of, or cure, East African HAT.
Competition for PAX-101 in ME/CFS and LCS
For treatment of ME/CFS, AIM ImmunoTech has an approval for rintatolimod in Argentina, and is in development for the drug in the US. For LCS, Tonix Pharmaceuticals is in Phase 2 studies for TNX-102 SL.
Research and Development
We spent approximately $1.7 million and $2.2 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on research and development activities, which activities have been undertaken by our CROs and other third-party vendors. These expenses include cash and non-cash expenses related to the development of our clinical and pre-clinical programs. From time to time, as needed, we will employ consultants to support our various business and research and development activities.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for product candidates and any of our future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing on or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, regulatory and marketing exclusivity such as orphan drug exclusivity, and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
As of December 31, 2022, we own rights to at least four families of patent applications (discussed further in the following three paragraphs). Our patent applications related to our product development candidates currently in development are projected to expire no 

11



earlier than 2039, not including any patent term adjustments, patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates, or other term extensions that might be available in a particular jurisdiction. We also plan to file further patent applications covering our technology and products. Additionally, we own the exclusive rights to patient data in certain East African hospitals that is necessary for our HAT NDA filing. 
On May 2, 2020 we filed PCT international patent Application No. PCT/US2020/031217 entitled Compositions and Methods for Treating Central Nervous System Disorders. This application claims priority to US Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 62/858,621, filed on June 7, 2019. The PCT application published as WO 2020/247127 on December 10, 2020. The PCT patent application relates to compositions and methods for treating cognitive, social, or behavioral disabilities, and neurodevelopmental disorders. These disabilities and disorders include, ASD and other central nervous system disorders such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). The patent application also includes further embodiments of ASD selected from autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, PDD-NOS, and Asperger syndrome. This patent application also relates to compositions for delivering a therapeutically effective amount of an APT, for example suramin, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, solvates, and prodrugs of these agents. In some embodiments, the APT is delivered by intranasal administration. All designated states (all PCT treaty member countries) were selected upon filing of the PCT patent application. National stage applications have been filed in the United States, Canada, Israel, and Japan. We also intend to file national stage applications in Australia and China, and a regional stage application with the European Patent Office prior to the final deadlines for doing so.
On October 20, 2021 we filed two PCT international patent applications. The first of these two PCT patent applications is PCT international patent Application No. PCT/US2021/55908 which is entitled Intranasal Administration of Suramin for Treating Nervous System Disorders. This application claims priority to US Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 63/104,350, filed on October 22, 2020. This PCT patent application relates to methods and compositions for the intranasal administration of suramin for treating cognitive, social, or behavioral disabilities, and neurodevelopmental disorders. The second of these two PCT patent applications is PCT international patent Application No. PCT/US2021/55911 which is entitled Administration of Antipurinergic Compositions for Treating Nervous System Disorders. This application claims priority to US Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 63/104,357, filed on October 22, 2020. This PCT patent application relates to methods and compositions for the administration of antipurinergic compositions for treating cognitive, social, or behavioral disabilities, and neurodevelopmental disorders. These two PCT patent applications have not yet published, because PCT patent applications generally publish 18 months from the earliest priority date, which in this instance would be after April 22, 2022. All designated states (all PCT treaty member countries) were selected upon filing of these two PCT patent applications. Various national phase patent applications have not yet been filed, because the 30- month national stage filing deadline for doing so is not until April 22, 2023. As part of our intellectual property strategy, we intend to file U.S. nonprovisional and foreign national and regional stage applications of these two PCT applications in due course.
On August 23, 2021, we filed a US provisional patent application relating to methods for treating nervous systems disorders with antipurinergic agents. The application relates to further aspects of our work for the administration of the antipurinergic agents based on pharmaco-kinetic/pharmaco-dynamic parameters and other learnings from our pre-clinical and clinical work. US provisional patent applications do not publish, but expire one year from the filing date, by which any US nonprovisional, PCT international, and/or foreign patent applications claiming priority to the provisional patent application would have to be filed. As part of our intellectual property strategy, we intend to file a PCT international application and U.S. nonprovisional, and foreign national and regional stage applications in due course.
While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to our products or processes may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringing our patent claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates.
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained.
Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a period due to delay by the USPTO in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. However, the actual 

12



protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by- product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies for our products or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future products may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
We are aware of PCT international patent application PCT/US2018/017674, titled “Methods for Autism Spectrum Disorder Pharmacotherapy”, which lists Perfect Daylight Limited and The Regents of the University of California as Applicants, filed on February 9, 2018, published as WO 2018/148580 on August 16, 2018, and claiming priority to U.S. provisional patent application no. 62/457,120, filed on February 9, 2017. The patent application describes compositions of antipurinergic agents, such as suramin, and methods of use for treating cognitive developmental disorders and autism spectrum disorder. From publicly available databases, we are aware that a U.S. national phase application of this PCT patent application, U.S. application Serial No. 16/537,397, was filed in the United States and is currently pending. The European equivalent of the application was granted as EP3579836 on December 15, 2021, which commenced a 9-month period for public opposition. A Chinese application, CN201880024535.9, is also pending.
We are also aware of PCT international patent application PCT/US2018/017200, titled “Antipurinergic Compounds and Uses thereof,” which lists CSP Pharma, Inc. as Applicant, filed on February 7, 2018, published as WO 2018/148262 on August 16, 2018, and claiming priority to U.S. provisional patent application no. 62/456,438, filed on February 8, 2017. The patent application describes compositions and methods for treating neurodevelopmental disorders. The compositions contain an APT, such as suramin, and a carrier formulated for non-intravenous administration. The neurodevelopmental disorders include ASD. From publicly available databases, we are aware that a national phase application of this PCT patent application, U.S. application Serial No. 16/484,284 was filed in the United States. However, the US Patent Office issued a Notice of Abandonment on August 12, 2021 for applicant’s failure to respond to the office action of January 14, 2021. No further child applications are listed as pending.
We are also aware of PCT international patent application PCT/US2017/041932, titled “Diagnostic and Methods of Treatment for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders,” which lists The Regents of the University of California as Applicant, filed on July 13, 2017, published as WO 2018/013811 on January 18, 2018, and claiming priority to U.S. provisional patent application nos. 62/ 464,369, filed on February 27, 2017 and 62/362,564, filed on July 14, 2016. The patent application describes biomarkers for diagnosing and predicting the development of chronic fatigue syndrome and methods of treating a mitochondrial disease or disorder, such as ASD, by administering an effective amount of an APT, such as suramin. Publicly available databases show no pending national or regional phase patent applications.
Because national phase applications of PCT/US2018/017674 are still pending at least in the United States and China, it is not certain if any patents will ultimately issue from these applications nor is it possible to predict the resultant claim scope of any such issued patent. We will continue to monitor the prosecution of these patent applications from publicly available documents.
License Agreements
On October 10, 2018 and November 9, 2018, we obtained the rights to worldwide, exclusive licenses to the patient data from the Ministry of Health, Republic of Malawi (the “Malawi License Agreement”) and Lwala Hospital (Soroti, Uganda) (the “Lwala License Agreement”), respectively, in connection with the treatment of East African HAT patients.
Under each of the Malawi License Agreement and the Lwala License Agreement (collectively, the “License Agreements”), we obtained an exclusive worldwide license to the medical data and information (in the form of patient medical files) related to patients who have been diagnosed with and/or treated for East African HAT. We intend to use these data to support our PAX-101 regulatory filings in the United States and Europe for the treatment of Stage 1 East African HAT. Pursuant to each of the License Agreements, we pay a fee to each licensor for its services in facilitating our access to, and analysis of, these data and we are obligated to make additional payments in the future based on the level of each licensor’s participation. As of September 30, 2022, we have paid an aggregate of $7,375 under the License Agreements. Each of the License Agreements has an indefinite term, but may be terminated by each party thereto upon material breach of the other party, if such breach is not remedied by the breaching party within 30 days after 

13



being given notice of such breach by the non-breaching party. We anticipate that we will pay a total of approximately $50,000 during the life of the Malawi License Agreement, and a total of approximately $50,000 during the life of the Lwala License Agreement.
Governmental Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical drug product candidates that we develop or acquire must be approved by the FDA before they may be marketed and distributed in the United States.
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA and related enforcement activity could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new pharmaceutical product;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced, to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA.s
--+-------------------------------------

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals, and continued compliance is inherently uncertain.
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. These early proof-of-principle studies are done using sound scientific procedures and thorough documentation. The conduct of the single and repeat dose toxicology and toxicokinetic studies in animals must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. If resolution cannot be reached within the 30-day review period, either the FDA places the IND on clinical hold or the sponsor withdraws the application. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies for various reasons. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical study.

14



Clinical studies involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1: The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients, with a goal of characterizing the safety profile of the drug and establishing a maximum tolerable dose (“MTD”).
Phase 2: With the maximum tolerable dose established in a Phase 1 trial, the pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population at the MTD to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.
Phase 3: Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are usually required by the FDA for an NDA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options. In some instances, an NDA approval may be obtained based on Phase 2 clinical data with the understanding that the approved drug can be sold subject to a confirmatory trial to be conducted post-approval.
Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are often used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The FDA also may require Phase 4 studies, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) and post-marketing surveillance, among other things, to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies may complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees. A waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.

15



The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has 10 months after the 60-day filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard review NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months after the 60-day filing date for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the pharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the pharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to assure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling.
The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
The 505(b)(2) NDA Regulatory Pathway
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to a full Section 505(b)(1) NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use, such as the FDA’s findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a similar previously approved product, or published literature, in support of its application.
505(b)(2) NDAs often provide a path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional 

16



studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. Thus approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has various programs intended to expedite or facilitate the process for developing and reviewing new pharmaceutical products that meet certain criteria. For example, new pharmaceutical products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, if the FDA determines that the schedule is acceptable and if the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for market, including a fast track program, may also be eligible for other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and it offers a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new pharmaceutical product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, accelerated approval may be available for a product intended to treat a serious condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, which means the product may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials for products receiving accelerated approval, which could impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others,
standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and/or U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with 

17



doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses.
We expect to rely on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The Priority Review Voucher Program
The FD&C Act section 524, authorizes FDA to award priority review vouchers (PRVs) to sponsors of approved tropical disease product applications that meet certain criteria. In July 2020, the FDA updated its guidance providing information on the implementation of section 524 of the FD&C Act — Tropical Disease Priority Review Vouchers Guidance for Industry.
To qualify for a PRV, a sponsor’s application must be for a drug or biological product for the prevention or treatment of a “tropical disease,” must otherwise qualify for priority review, and must contain no active ingredient (including any salt or ester of an active ingredient) that has been approved in any other application under section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the Public Health Services Act.
While the FDA aims to complete a standard review in about 10 months, a PRV may result in the acceleration of review and approval of a product candidate by up to four months. However, despite the issuance of a PRV, the FDA is not obligated to, and may not, accelerate the timing of a review.
The Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act of 2017 made changes to the eligibility criteria for receipt of a tropical disease priority review voucher. Applications submitted after September 30, 2017 must also contain reports of one or more new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) that are essential to the approval of the application and conducted or sponsored by the sponsor. In addition, the applicant must provide in the application an attestation that such report(s) were not submitted as part of an application for marketing approval or licensure by a regulatory authority in India, Brazil, Thailand, or any country that is a member of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention or the Pharmaceutical Inspection Cooperation Scheme prior to September 27, 2007.
Once the sponsor obtains a PRV, the voucher can be used to obtain priority review designation for a subsequent application that does not itself qualify for priority review as described in the guidance.
HAT is on FDA’s current list of tropical diseases. We are not aware of any clinical trial activity in East African HAT, other than the activities we are conducting.
Exclusivity
Under various statutes, products approved by FDA may qualify for market exclusivity. For example, orphan drug exclusivity prevents, with some exceptions, FDA approval for seven years of another product with the same active moiety for the same rare disease. Hatch-Waxman exclusivity provides new chemical entities five years of protection against FDA approval of ANDAs relying
​
on the application of the new chemical entity. Under another form of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity, products that are not new chemical entities may obtain three years of exclusivity against approval of ANDAs relying on the application of that product.
While we anticipate that we will be eligible to be awarded FDA market exclusivity for each program that we bring to market, there can be no certainty that any of our products will be eligible for or obtain any form of FDA exclusivity.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not, and frequently does not include all of the FDA- approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, in the United States there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payers and by government agencies. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our pharmaceutical product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payers may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products and/or reimburse our products at a lower rate.
The marketability of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third- party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we may receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
Employees and Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2022, we had three full-time employees and two part-time employees. Each of these employees is located in the United States.
We are subject to local labor laws and regulations with respect to our employees in the jurisdictions in which they are employed. These laws principally concern matters such as paid annual vacation, paid sick days, length of the workday and work week, minimum wages, pay for overtime, and insurance for workers’ compensation.
Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and it is our understanding that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
