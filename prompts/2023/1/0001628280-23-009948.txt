Item 1 Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this section to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refer to the business of Wag, Labs, Inc. and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Merger described below under "Our History" or Wag! Group Co. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, after the consummation of the Business Combination.
Overview
Our mission is to be the #1 partner to busy Pet Parents. We believe that being busy shouldn’t stop Pet Parents from owning or taking care of their pets. We are dedicated to building a future in which every pet has access to comprehensive, safe, and high-quality care right at the fingertips of those who support them; whether that be time spent out in the fresh air, training, insurance options to fit their needs, pet food alternatives up to their caliber, or pet health products delivered directly to their front door. This future will be built by a passionate community of pet lovers and pet focused vendors who are dedicated creating joy for pets and those who love them. Wag! Group Co. ("Wag!") is the holistic pet care platform for bringing these passionate providers and vendors together in one place, and we are just getting started.
Wag! exists to make pet ownership possible and to bring joy to pets and those who love them. We are committed to maximizing the happiness of pets and Pet Parents alike. Your furry family member deserves the best, and that’s what we strive to deliver every day, through thoughtful innovation and a platform that is disrupting the traditional pet care and wellness industry with technology that enables Pet Parents to manage the health and well-being of their furry family member seamlessly and efficiently.
Our History
Wag! Group Co., formerly known as CHW Acquisition Corporation ("CHW) is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. Wag Labs, Inc., a Delaware corporation and, after the Merger described below, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Legacy Wag!”) Legacy Wag! was incorporated in 2014 and was founded as an American pet services marketplace company powering a mobile-first technology platform that enabled on-demand and scheduled dog walking, overnight care, training, and other pet care services. Wag! expanded its service offerings into the pet wellness industry through its wellness offerings, together with the acquisition of Compare Pet Insurance Services, Inc., in August 2021. 
On August 9, 2022, pursuant to the terms of a business combination agreement (the "Business Combination Agreement"), CHW Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of CHW merged with and into Legacy Wag! (the "Merger"), with Legacy Wag! surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of CHW. The Merger was approved by CHW’s stockholders at a meeting held on July 28, 2022. At the closing of the Merger, CHW changed its name to Wag! Group, Co. 
Our Business
Our company was founded in 2015, born from a passion for the well-being of pets and an entrepreneurial spirit focused on making pet parenthood easier so that pets and their humans can share a fulfilling life full of joyful moments. Wag! develops and supports a proprietary marketplace technology platform available as a website and mobile app that enables independent Pet Caregivers and vendors to connect with Pet Parents. We built a platform where Pet Parents can find Pet Caregivers who want to earn extra income, together with a marketplace of services providers and vendors who are able to provide support for pets. We believe that these connections not only enable better care for pets, but also create joy for both parties, and so we sought to radically simplify the logistics of pet care. Beyond providing unrivaled services to premium Pet Parents, Wag! has expanded its reach to become the "button on the phone for the paw". Wag! is a key player in the pet wellness market via the management and operation of Petted.com, a pet insurance comparison service, as well as through the acquisition of Furmacy, Inc. ("Furmacy") which delivers pet health products directly to the door of loving Pet Parents. We have experienced consistent strong growth year over year, increasing annual revenue 
by over 170% from 2021 to 2022. Additionally, in 2023, Wag! expanded into the $50 billion pet food and treat market by acquiring from Clicks and Traffic LLC the assets of Dog Food Advisor, one of the most visited and trusted dog food marketplaces in the US ("Dog Food Advisor"). Wag! believes that the addition of Dog Food Advisor will unlock tremendous value and insights for recurring and new customers alike; those to whom we already provide an unparalleled marketplace experience in the wellness space and longtime customers who rely on Dog Food Advisor for expert advice. Wag! exists to make pet ownership possible and bring joy to pets and those who love them.
For Pet Caregivers, we built tools to easily create a listing in the Wag! platform, along with simple tools for promoting their profile online, scheduling and booking service opportunities, communicating with Pet Parents, and receiving payment. To assist both Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers, we invested in a customer service team available 24/7 to support them along the way. To be a brand dedicated to trust and safety, we thoroughly vet and screen all Pet Caregivers, and provide up to $1 million property damage protection, subject to certain terms and conditions.
 With over 450,000 Pet Caregivers approved through 2022, our network of caregivers enables us to facilitate connections between pet, parent, and caregiver to best meet the unique needs and preferences of all members of the community. Our results speak for themselves — Pet Parents love Wag!. Based on internal reporting, from inception through December 2022, Pet Parents have written over 11 million reviews, more than 96% of which have earned five stars. As a Company which understands the walking business, having provided over 14 million miles on foot since inception, we know that the experience is a two-way street. Our engineers work to optimize the experience for Pet Caregivers just as they do for our Pet Parents, and in 2022 launched the ability to leave notes on furry friends for future Pet Caregivers to ensure a seamless experience. 
We believe the demand for high-quality, personalized pet care far exceeds the existing market due to the increases in pet adoption and return to office policies being implemented. As of the end of December 2022, although we saw a steady rise throughout the year, less than 50% of people were back in-office based on the Kastle "Back to Work Barometer" data study. According to a study performed by Adzuna research in November 2022, this number is expected to rise as employers openly state firmer in-office policies in 2023. Additionally, the proportion of open roles specifying an “office-based” requirement has risen to a 19-month high of 4.2%. Beyond the pet service sector of the addressable market, untapped potential coupled with the continued trend of the humanization of pets may lead to a spike in the pet insurance space. According to an industry report released by the North American Pet Health Insurance Association, there was an increase of approximately 30% from 2020 to 2021 of insured pets in North America. While this growth is exciting for Wag!, over 155 million pets in the United States still remain uninsured; leaving approximately 97% of pets in the United States as potential entrants into the market. 
We are committed to improving the quality of life for all pets. To give back to our communities, we donate a portion of the proceeds from each walk to local shelters. From our inception through December 2022, we have donated over 16.5 million meals to pets in need through our partnership with the Greater Good Rescue Bank Program. We have also partnered with the Humane Society of the United States.
In 2022, we derived revenue from four distinct streams: (1) service fees charged to Pet Caregivers; (2) subscription and other fees paid by Pet Parents for Wag! Premium; (3) registration fees paid by Pet Caregivers to join and be listed on our platform, and (4) wellness revenue through affiliate fees, prescription and over-the-counter sales. Beginning in 2023, we expect to recognize additional revenue in the pet food and treat category via affiliate fees paid by third-party service partners based on ‘revenue-per-action’ or conversion activity due to the acquisition of Dog Food Advisor.
Our Strategy 
During 2022 and 2021, we continued to grow and innovate our pet service and wellness offerings. When we look to the future, we believe that there are numerous opportunities to expand our Premium pet platform. As mentioned previously, we are excited about our entrance into the pet food and treat market through the digital presence that Dog Food Advisor provides. By accelerating growth in existing markets, expanding subscription services, and expanding our platform into new markets, we believe we can continue to grow and progress towards being the premier pet wellness platform. We remain committed to our long-term strategic initiatives of measured expansion, opportunistic mergers and acquisitions, and becoming an all-inclusive, trusted partner for Pet Parents. 
As a leading supporter of Pet Parents and the health and well-being of their pets it is our mission to continue to find ways to help Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers holistically. We aim to continue to help Pet Parents provide for their pet more efficiently and effectively, while making better and more informed decisions as quickly as they desire; the "button on the phone for the paw". For Pet Caregivers, we want to continue to provide them with an opportunity to earn income on their own schedule. Within our marketplace and platform, we leverage proprietary technology and data to empower both Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers to reach these goals.
 To achieve these goals, we intend to continue to grow our business by pursuing the following key strategies:
•Accelerate growth in existing markets. We believe that immense growth remains within our existing offerings and geographies. With over 95% of the U.S. population having access to Wag!, as of December 2022, approximately 434,234 platform participants transacted on the Wag! platform for at least one service in the fourth quarter of 2022. One of the main drivers of our brand is word-of-mouth growth in local markets. With over 450,000 Pet Caregivers approved throughout North America, we want to continue to increase bookings and services.
•Expand subscription offerings. Wag! Premium is an annual or monthly subscription that offers 10% off all services booked as well as waived booking fees, free advice from licensed pet experts, priority access to top-rated Pet Caregivers, and VIP Pet Parent support. We plan to introduce additional service offerings in the Wag! marketplace to further support pets, parents, and Pet Caregivers and to drive significant revenue growth.
•Platform expansion. We aim to service Pet Parents with the #1 on-demand mobile first platform, including through introducing additional services unique to the Wag! platform. In addition to digitizing the facilitation of on demand pet services end-to-end, we also reimagined the pet wellness model by consolidating facets of the market such as finding insurance coverage to ordering prescription medicine into once place. For example, in the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Compare Pet Insurance Services, Inc. ("CPI") and expanded our platform into the wellness market via a pet insurance comparison marketplace. We now operate Petted.com, the nation's largest pet insurance comparison marketplace, to allow Pet Parents to compare the top insurance providers for the best deal and perfect plan for their beloved pet. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired Furmacy, Inc. ("Furmacy") a concierge prescription and compounding service that delivers pet health directly to the Pet Parent's door. 
•Opportunistic mergers and acquisitions. We believe that, over time, we can extend the value of Wag! with strategic acquisitions in the pet industry and others, including pet products, vet care, and technology to improve the efficiency and efficacy of the Wag! platform. In the first quarter of 2023, Wag! entered the pet food and treat category with the acquisition of Dog Food Advisor which helps Pet Parents make informed decisions about dog food. This is a key example of merger and acquisition activity that allows us to expand into other areas of the industry, while still remaining true to the core of what we do: bettering the pet ownership experience in a digital and data driven manner.
Our Market Opportunity
The total U.S. market for pet spending was $123.6 billion in 2021, including pet food and treats, veterinary care and product sales, pet supplies, and other non-medical services, according to the APPA. This is an increase of over 19% from the previous year, driven largely by the COVID-19 pandemic spike in pet population. The industry is generally viewed via the APPA breakdown of four categories: 1) Pet Food & Treats; 2) Supplies, Live Animals & OTC Medicine; 3) Vet Care & Product Sales; and 4) Other Services (inclusive of insurance). Wag! enters into 2023 with product offerings in three of the aforementioned four markets; anchored by our premium subscription service which spans across market lines.

[2] | The “Wellness” category equates to the APPA “Vet Care & Product Sales” market category. 

We believe that the commercial market for pet care represents an enormous expansion opportunity because the existing commercial market for pet care is limited due to the challenges of traditional pet care service and wellness offerings. 
Key Products and Services
Wag! Services
Through the Wag! platform, Pet Parents can connect with Pet Caregivers to schedule an appointment of a desired pet service from a Pet Caregiver. Our platform allows Pet Parents to request from Pet Caregivers a multitude of preset services, including pre-scheduled and on-demand dog walking, drop-in visits at the Pet Parent’s home, pet boarding at a caregiver’s home, in-home pet sitting, and in-home one-on-one dog training and digital dog training. Our platform allows Pet Parents to specify required parameters, such as length of walk or specific pet needs, and then receive real-time updates, photos or videos, and a complete report card from the Pet Caregiver. Following the service, Pet Parents have the ability to provide written review of the Pet Caregivers, helping Pet Caregivers build their profile and business with the Wag! platform.
Wag! Premium, available to all Pet Parents, is an annual or monthly subscription that offers 10% off all services booked as well as other features, such as waived booking fees, free advice from licensed pet experts, priority access to top-rated Pet Caregivers, and VIP Pet Parent support.
In 2022, there were over 90 million pets in U.S. households, according to the APPA. In April 2020, the national pet adoption rate jumped 34% as compared to the same period a year earlier, according to Shelter Animals Count. In addition, the ASPCA estimated in May 2021 that 23 million households adopted a pet during the pandemic. With this increase in pet ownership and more people returning to the office in upcoming year, we believe there are increased opportunities to help busy Pet Parents find pet care services.
Wag! Wellness
Our suite of wellness services include Vet Chat, wellness plans, pet insurance comparison, and pet prescription Rx. Vet Chat enables Pet Parents to connect with a licensed pet expert around the clock through our platform for real-time advice on their pets’ behavior, health and other needs. Pet wellness plans enable Pet Parents to take out coverage for their pets to cover every day items. Pet insurance comparison enables Pet Parents to instantly compare insurance quotes and coverage from top-rated pet insurance providers, including Lemonade, Pets Best, Embrace, Trupanion, Petplan, and Prudent Pet. Prescription Rx, through Furmacy, enables vets and Pet Parents to quickly and efficiently obtain prescriptions.
By offering Pet Parents the opportunity to consult a licensed pet expert 24/7, pet wellness plans, and the ability to compare pet insurance plans, Wag! has proven its ability to diversify the total addressable market ("TAM") and unlock new spending in pet wellness. 
Our Customers
Pets and Pet Parents
According to the 2021-2022 APPA National Pet Owners Survey, 70% of U.S. households own a pet, which equates to 90.5 million homes. This is an increase of 3% from 2021. For example, one-in-five households in the United States adopted a pet during the pandemic, based on a poll conducted in May 2021 by ASPCA. Led by Millennials and Generation Z, many Pet Parents increasingly consider the needs of their pets, not just equally important to those of the rest of the family, but more important. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, almost 90% of Pet Parents consider their pet a member of the family. This has led to increases in pet spending by necessity and desire to provide for their pet as any other member of the family. In light of these trends, marketplaces, such as Dog Food Advisor and Petted.com, can provide Pet Parents with both knowledge and power to execute on that desire with a few simple clicks.
Pet Parent’s Wants and Needs
Wag! was founded to make pet ownership possible because we believe that being busy should not prevent an individual from owning or taking care of his or her pet. We believed a platform like ours could better address 
Pet Parents’ basic pet care needs — and that doing so represented an enormous business opportunity. We wanted to offer exceptional quality, ease of use, and affordability. In short, Pet Parents are seeking:
•A positive stress-free experience for their pets. Pet Parents want regular reassurance that their pets feel as comfortable as they would at home. While some commercial providers try to address this need with innovations like pet webcams, Pet Parents often desire more peace of mind.
•Quality personalized care for their pets. Pet Parents want assurances that their pets’ care is personalized to their needs and expectations. They also want to know that there are resources in place to handle problems that arise while they are away from their pets. Wag! platform pet data is frequently updated through the natural course of a service, which creates potential for personalized pet recommendations including but not limited to age, breed, average walk distance and photos. 
•The availability of personalized on-demand pet services. Pet Parents want the ability to care and provide for their pets as soon as a need arises.
•Technology-enabled ease of access and management to pet services. Pet Parents expect to be able to use their mobile devices or computers to find available providers who will meet their pet’s needs. They want to effortlessly contact and communicate, book and pay for a service, and stay connected so they can feel confident their pet is safe and happy in their absence.
•Pet care that suits their budget and their lifestyle. While many Pet Parents may find commercial solutions too expensive, they are willing to pay the right price for the right care. For other parents whose pets often have specific needs or requirements, cost is not a barrier in exchange for safe, trusted, loving care.
Pet Caregivers
Our success is built on the foundation of dedicated Pet Caregivers who have chosen to provide their services through us. Wag! provides Pet Caregivers with flexibility and empowerment, enabling their passion for pets to become a way to make money, exercise, and participate in their local community. Through our platform, Pet Caregivers can connect with a nationwide community of Pet Parents. Some Pet Caregivers view the provision of pet care services as their full-time job. We support them by providing an additional avenue to build their pet care business and achieve meaningful income. Other Pet Caregivers simply love and enjoy caring for pets in addition to other avenues of employment. We support these more casual Pet Caregivers by providing them access to Pet Parents looking for pet care services, a means to earn some additional supplemental income, an enjoyable gig involving time outdoors and healthy habits, and flexibility in when and how they perform services. We give both full-time and casual Pet Caregivers the ability to share their love of pets with the Wag! pet community.
Similar to Pet Parents, when prospective Pet Caregivers encounter Wag! for the first time, we aim to anticipate and address many of their needs in advance. We added features to allow caregivers the opportunity to view notes before a service so they can make a more informed decision before requesting that service, the freedom to set their own prices, the option to withdraw earnings instantly for a small fee, ability to expand their reach to new Pet Parents and grow their business with social links to their profile and custom HTML Craigslist links, and the opportunity to access advice from seasoned veterans on the mobile app and tips to help them grow a successful pet care business. 
Pet Caregivers who establish a presence on Wag! discover that the process to be approved as a caregiver is straightforward and simple, which helps them build trust and transparency with Pet Parents. Specifically, applicants are screened and required to pass a background check and a pet care test before they can be approved to offer services on the Wag! platform. All new Pet Caregivers also have the opportunity to complete a “test walk,” which is a simulated service that allows the Pet Caregiver to become familiar with the Wag! platform. We also provide built-in community safety features, such as the ability for a Pet Caregiver to flag chat conversations with a Pet Parent, block a Pet Parent’s service requests, and leave a review of a pet for other caregivers to consider. These measures reassure Pet Caregivers that they are joining a platform that cares about trust and reliability.
Wag! provides flexible, straightforward booking management tools. Our platform offers tools that allow Pet Caregivers to manage bookings and safely communicate to share photos, videos, and GPS mapping. Pet Caregivers receive safe, secure, and convenient online payments, set their availability with our calendar feature, 
and only book care that’s a fit for their preferences and schedule. Our around the clock dedicated support team provides peace of mind for Pet Caregivers.
Wellness service providers 
Through digitalization of the pet wellness market, we have integrated subject matter experts from all corners of the wellness industry, such as veterinarians and insurance providers, into the Wag! community. Our insurance marketplace facilitates the ability for Pet Parents to connect with top insurance providers in order to select the best plan for their pet. Wag! acts as the trusted liaison between the two parties. Additionally, via the Furmacy business, we provide the linkage between the Pet Parent and their veterinarian to provide Rx, over-the-counter and custom medication (compounds) directly to their home. The facilitation of pet wellness services places Wag! in a unique position of capturing both sides of the market: the business of either or both the Pet Parent and pet professional depending on the wellness need.
Wag! is also positioning itself to provide routine and anticipated healthcare needs to pets. Through our wellness plan offerings, we facilitate connections between Pet Parents and providers who furnish customized packages of routine care that every pet needs such as wellness exams, routine blood work and other diagnostics, vaccines and boosters, flea and tick meds, dental cleaning and even spay/neuter procedures.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for in aggregate approximately 27% of total revenue, versus zero in the year ended December 31, 2021. For a discussion of risks related to customer concentration, see Part I, Item 1A, - Risk Factors: "The Company is substantially dependent on revenues from a small number of customers utilizing Wag! Wellness services and products. The loss of or decrease in revenue from any one of these customers could adversely affect Wag!’s business, results of operations, and financial condition" and Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. 
Competitive Strengths
As we grow our online pet service, wellness, and dog food and treat platform, our competitive strengths relative to other online competitors include:
•Proprietary and innovative technology platform. Our technology platform was built to enable us to connect Pet Parents with Pet Caregivers, wellness providers, and dog food and treat providers. We own and operate all meaningful technology utilized in our business.
•Service offerings. Our platform offers access to pet services across the spectrum of the pet services categories including (1) Pet Food & Treats, (2) Supplies, Live Animals & Over-the-Counter Medicine, (3) Vet Care & Product Sales, and (4) Other Services. 
•Large number of high-quality Pet Caregivers. Pet Caregivers are attracted to the Wag! platform. With the ability to make money on their own time, Pet Caregivers enjoy the flexibility of choosing how and when they want to work — claiming a last minute appointment or planning out an appointment weeks in advance. We currently have over 450,000 Pet Caregivers approved to provide services on Wag!.
•Industry best insurance comparison tool. Our proprietary insurance comparison tool allows Pet Parents to quickly and efficiently obtain and compare pet insurance coverage and fee quotes from leading pet insurance providers.
•High-quality pet service. With over 11 million Pet Parent reviews, more than 96% of which have earned five stars, we lead the industry in quality. 
•Strong Pet Parent loyalty and word-of-mouth. Our continuous excellence in facilitating connections between pet, parent, and Pet Caregiver translates directly into advantages in our ability to retain Pet Parents. 
•Premier online destination for pet services. According to recent industry surveys conducted by Similarweb.com, Wag! was one of the top three online pets and animals websites in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022 with more than 4,700,000 monthly visitors.
Foundation of Trust and Safety
Safety on every booking is important to us, and we are committed to reducing the number of incidents in the Wag! community. If an incident occurs, we are committed to improving our effectiveness in responding. To bring peace of mind for Pet Parents, all Pet Caregivers are screened, background checked, and approved prior to being approved to provide services on the Wag! platform. We also have a dedicated 24/7 support team to assist pets and their parents around the clock, and convenient tools for Pet Parents to obtain real-time information about their pets during a service. In the event there is damage to a Pet Parent’s property, they may be protected with up to $1 million property damage protection (subject to applicable policy limitations and exclusions). We move quickly to correct behaviors that are not consistent with our Community Guidelines and do not hesitate to remove both Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers from our platform when they behave in ways that violate our standards.
Technology and Infrastructure
Our technology platform is designed to provide an efficient marketplace experience across our website and mobile apps. Our technology vision is to build and deliver secure, flexible, scalable systems, tools, and products that exceed expectations for Pet Parents, Pet Caregivers, and pet service providers, as well as accelerate growth and improve productivity.
Our booking platform connects to the front-end customer web and mobile clients, as well as to our support operations team. This platform also connects to our data science platform. We collect and secure information generated from user activity and use machine learning to continuously improve our booking systems. We have a common platform that allows us to seamlessly internationalize our product, integrate images and videos, use experiments to optimize user experience and test product improvements in real time, monitor our site reliability, and rapidly respond to incidents. Finally, our core booking platform connects to leading third-party vendors for communications, payment processing, IT operations management, as well as background checks.
We focus on user experience, quality, consistency, reliability, and efficiency when developing our software. We are also investing in continuously improving our data privacy, data protection, and security foundations, and we continually review and update our related policies and practices.
Support Operations
Our support team assists Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers with bookings, safety issues, and questions concerning any pet service. Because we are committed to the safety and happiness of all dogs in our care, and peace of mind for Pet Parents, we offer 24/7 assistance to our entire community.
Marketing
Our marketing strategy is focused on attracting Pet Parents, Pet Caregivers, and pet service providers, to our marketplace. We depend on paid marketing, organic marketing and brand marketing strategies, along with creating virality and word-of-mouth acquisition through our product experience. Through our blog, "The Daily Wag!", we attract new users to our marketplace. Wag! is top-ranking in both the Travel and Local (Google Play) and Travel (iOS) categories for key search terms through App Store optimization and strong consumer rankings and reviews. In addition, our website saw more than six million visitors per month from direct or unpaid traffic sources in 2022, the majority of which came from our search engine optimization efforts. In 2022, we saw an average of 70% organic customer acquisition.
While we rely significantly on word-of-mouth, organic search, and other unpaid channels, we believe that a significant amount of the growth in the number of Pet Parents and Pet Caregivers that use the platform is also attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising, billboards, radio, video, television, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified advertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and paid keyword search campaigns.
Competitors
The markets in which we operate are highly fragmented. We face multiple competitors across different categories, and our competitors vary in both size and breadth of services. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors, who may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages, as well as new entrants into the market, some of which may become significant competitors in the future. Our main competitors include:
•Family, friends, and neighbors. Our largest competitive dynamic remains the people to whom Pet Parents go for pet care within their personal networks. This typically includes veterinarians, neighbors, family, and friends with whom the Pet Parent and pet are familiar and comfortable.
•Local independent professionals. Local small businesses and independent professionals often operate at small scale with little to no online presence, primarily relying on word of mouth and marketing solutions such as flyers and local ads. As a Pet Parent, it is difficult to know where to find reliable information, who to call, and who to trust.
•Large, commercial providers. Large commercial providers, such as kennels and daycares, often struggle to meet the individual needs of Pet Parents and their pets. Such providers can be expensive, and their facilities are often crowded, inducing stress in some pets and leading Pet Parents to question the quality of care their pets receive.
•Online aggregators and directories. Pet Parents can also access general purpose online aggregators and directories, such as Google, Wirecutter, Craigslist, Nextdoor, or Yelp, to find pet care providers and ratings and rankings for similar marketplace offerings. However, Pet Parents may lack trust in these directories, or find it difficult to find an available and appropriate pet care provider.
•Other digital marketplaces. We compete with companies such as Rover and the pet care offering on Care.com. We differentiate ourselves with the breadth of our pet service options and simplicity in booking. For example, Wag! is the only marketplace to offer on-demand booking for dog walking and drop-in visits at the Pet Parent’s home, enabling Pet Parents to find a local Pet Caregiver in less than 15 minutes. In addition, our monthly subscription, Wag! Premium, enables Pet Parents to a suite of platform features including discounts on additional services, such as boarding, sitting, and training. Finally, through our Wag! wellness suite of services, Pet Parents can chat with a licensed pet expert 24/7.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 82 employees, including the business leaders of Furmacy, Inc who are currently included in the "Executive" department below . The breakout of employees by department is as follows as of December 31, 2022:
Run, Dig, Play & Catch
In 2022, as Wag!'s technology platform and overall business grew, we leaned on our values of "Run, Dig, Play and Catch" to help support employees and the Wag! Community. We continued our remote-first hybrid workplace strategy to provide employees with the flexibility for any caregiving responsibilities including, for dependents or other family members. This meant creating and fostering an open and accepting work environment where leaders and managers supported flexible work schedules, paid family leave and/or paid time off. For those employees seeking community and social engagement, we hosted virtual and in-person events. Wag! also provides 360 feedback and role growth opportunities as part of our twice-a-year performance management program to assist employees with development. We integrate the aforementioned Wag! values into the performance management and feedback process to help recognize not only those who perform, but also to recognize and celebrate those who exhibit our values and contribute to the culture.
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion
Diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI") are core to Wag!'s culture. We are committed to building a workplace where people of all backgrounds and walks of life can thrive. We know that diverse and inclusive teams build more creative and innovative solutions that strengthen our business and reinforce our values. In 2022, we donated to several organizations that align with our values, including the Center of Policing Equity, which measures bias in policing and has goals to help stop such biases, and one•n•ten which serves LGBTQ youth and young adults ages 11-24 by providing empowering social and service programs that promote self-expression, self-acceptance, leadership development, and healthy life choices. Wag! also celebrates diversity events, for example LGBT Pride Month internally and externally on our social media channels each year, and recognizes Juneteenth as a company holiday. Wag! intends to maintain, iterate and add to our DEI initiatives and programs to broaden their impacts, as Wag! continues to grow.
Safety
Safety will always be Wag!'s top priority, and in 2022 we maintained a fully optional in-person work policy. We believe that our employees can excel and be productive wherever they choose to work, but recognize that 
certain employees seek to be around their co-workers and spend some time in the office. In order to attract and retain high performing employees while also being as inclusive as we can, we believe a remote-first hybrid approach to work is the best fit for our business, culture, and team. Our hybrid work policy allows employees and teams to select the work mode that best fits their personal needs. We do not anticipate any full-time in-person work requirements for our employees. In 2022, the sustainability of our working environment and employee well-being also remained a key priority. We retained our expanded sick and leave policies that were established in 2020, as well as periodic company-wide half-day Fridays to supplement Wag!'s paid time off policies.
Priorities
We are committed to: 
•Attracting and retaining world-class talent with diverse backgrounds and experiences;
•Offering equitable and inclusive pay, benefits and policies;
•Fostering a safe workspace and requiring anti-discrimination and anti-harassment training;
•Fine-tuning our recruiting efforts and procedures, including but not limited to reviewing job descriptions for inclusive language, sourcing from wide talent pools and a structured interview process; and
•Creating an inclusive environment where employees feel welcome, valued, respected, supported, heard, and appreciated.
Furthermore, we are focused on employee engagement, which studies have shown is linked with high performance, retention, innovation, and growth. We also believe this helps us evaluate the effectiveness and inclusivity of our Employment Programs, Practices and Policies. Our employees have chosen to work at Wag! because they believe in our action-oriented, values-based, and purpose-driven work culture. In March 2022, Wag! conducted an engagement survey of all employees. 83% of employees submitted a response, and 81% of respondents reported favorable employee engagement, ahead of industry peers in the New Tech category according to research done by Culture Amp.

Data Privacy, Data Protection and Security
Our privacy and information security program is designed and implemented, both within our internal systems and on our platform, to address the security and compliance requirements of personal or other regulated data related to Pet Parents, Pet Caregivers, and our employees.
We have a team of professionals that focuses on technical measures such as application, network, and system security, as well as policy measures related to privacy compliance, internal training and education, business continuity, and documented incident response protocols. Our information security protocols include periodic scans designed to identify security vulnerabilities on our servers, workstations, network equipment, production equipment, and applications, and we address remediation of any discovered vulnerabilities according to severity. We use various technical safeguards throughout our network, including but not limited to multi-factor authentication, permissioning software, audit logs, and other security controls to control access to internal systems that contain personal or other confidential information.
We design and implement our platform, offerings, and policies to facilitate compliance with evolving privacy, data protection, and data security laws and regulations, as well as to demonstrate respect for the privacy and data protection rights of our users and employees. We publish our user-related privacy practices on our website, and we further maintain certain additional internal policies and practices relating to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information.
Publication of our Privacy Statement and other policies and notices regarding privacy, data protection, and data security may subject us to investigation or enforcement actions by state and federal regulators if those statements, notices, or policies are found to be deficient, lacking transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices. We also may be bound from time to time by contractual obligations related to privacy, data protection, or data security. The laws and regulations to which we are subject relating to privacy, data protection, and data security, as well as their interpretation and enforcement, are evolving and we expect them to continue to change. For example, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which came into effect on January 1, 2023 and amends the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA” and together with the California Privacy Right Act of 2020, collectively, the “CPRA”), among other things, requires covered companies to provide specified disclosures to California consumers about such companies’ collection, use and sharing of their personal information, gives California residents expanded rights to access, correct and delete their personal information, and affords such consumers abilities to opt out of certain “sales” or transfers of personal information, the processing of sensitive personal information for certain purposes and the use of personal information for cross context behavioral advertising. Guidance related to the CPRA continues to evolve and these acts have lead some states, namely Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut, and will likely lead other states to pass comparable legislation. Other privacy and data security laws and regulations to which we may be subject include, for example, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. More generally, the various legal obligations that apply to us relating to privacy and data security may evolve in a manner that relates to our practices or the features of our mobile applications or website. We may need to take additional measures to comply with new and evolving legal obligations and to maintain and improve our information security posture in an effort to reduce information security incidents or avoid breaches affecting personal information or other sensitive or proprietary data. For additional information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Privacy and Technology — Changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, or any actual or perceived failure by Wag! to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations, including contractual obligations, relating to privacy, data protection, or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect Wag!’s business.”
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations, and standards in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, pricing, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, animal and human health and safety, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, insurance producer licensing and market conduct, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, product liability, 
environmental protection, taxation, privacy, data protection, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, e-commerce, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. These laws, regulations, and standards are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity or unclear applicability, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. Noncompliance with state insurance statutes or regulations may subject Wag! to regulatory action by the relevant state insurance regulator, and, in certain states, private litigation.
National, state, and local governmental authorities have enacted or pursued, and may in the future enact and pursue, measures designed to regulate the “gig economy.” For example, in 2019, the California Assembly passed AB-5, which codified a narrow worker classification test that has had the effect of treating many “gig economy” workers as employees. AB-5 includes a referral agency exemption that specifically applies to animal services and dog walking and grooming, and we believe that Wag! falls within this exemption.
In addition, other jurisdictions could adopt similar laws that do not include such carve outs and which, if applied to Wag!’s platform, could adversely impact its availability and our business.
On October 13, 2022, the United States Department of Labor published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the classification of workers as independent contractors or employees. The comment period closed on December 13, 2022. We are monitoring the development of the proposed rule and will evaluate any potential impact of the final rule on our operations.
Other types of new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our business and related technologies. For instance, state and local governments have in the past pursued, or may in the future pursue or enact, licensing, zoning, or other regulation that impacts the ability of individuals to provide home-based pet care.
One of our subsidiaries operates pet insurance comparison engine webpages. This subsidiary is not an underwriter of insurance risk nor does it act in the capacity of an insurance company. Rather, it is licensed and regulated as an insurance producer. On its website, the subsidiary may refer its customers to options for pet insurance plans provided and sold through unaffiliated third parties, including through unaffiliated insurance carriers. The subsidiary’s insurance comparison search feature provides hyperlinks by which consumers are connected with a pet insurance provider’s website to purchase an insurance plan. Each state has its own insurance statutes and regulations and applicable regulatory agency. Generally, each state requires insurers and insurance producers to be licensed in that state. Our subsidiary maintains insurance producer licenses in each state in which it operates. All insurance plans referred to by the subsidiary through its insurance comparison search feature are provided by third-party insurance companies. The subsidiary accepts neither premium payments from consumers nor responsibility for paying any amounts on claims.
For more information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulation and Taxation — Wag!’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, many of which are unsettled and still developing and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject Wag! to claims or otherwise adversely affect Wag!’s business, financial condition, or operating results; Government regulation of the Internet, mobile devices and e-commerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could substantially adversely affect Wag!’s business, financial condition, and operating results”; and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Privacy and Technology — Changes in laws, regulations, or industry standards relating to privacy, data protection, or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, or any actual or perceived failure by Wag! to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations, including contractual obligations, relating to privacy, data protection, or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect Wag!’s business.”
We are subject to audits by taxing authorities and other forms of investigation, audit, or inquiry conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies, none of which have resulted in a material assessment.
On May 13, 2022, Legacy Wag! settled a claim with a Texas state tax authority related to the collection of sales and use taxes in Texas. Legacy Wag! was required to pay $1.2 million to the state of Texas, the amount of 
the claim, as a prerequisite to the court challenge, but under the settlement agreement received those funds back.
Employment and Labor
In August 2018, the New York State Department of Labor (“DOL”) issued an Investigation Report assessing Legacy Wag! with approximately $250,000 in unemployment insurance contributions for our independent contractors. In May 2021, the Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board affirmed its decision sustaining the Department’s assessment. Interest continues to accrue on this assessment.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of state, federal, and common-law rights and trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws in the United States and other jurisdictions together with confidentiality agreements, contractual restrictions, and technical measures to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary rights. To protect our trade secrets, we control access to our proprietary systems and technology and enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third-parties in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our confidential and proprietary technology and to preserve our rights thereto. We also have registered and unregistered trademarks for the names of many of our products and services, and we are the registrant of the domain registrations for all of our material websites.
As of December 31, 2022, we hold 7 registered trademarks in the United States. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.wagwalking.com and other variations. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. We also utilize third-party content, software, technology and intellectual property in connection with our business.
We are presently involved in intellectual property lawsuits and may continue to face allegations from third parties, including our competitors, that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
In June 2015, a lawsuit against Wag! was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California by Wag Hotels, Inc. alleging trademark infringement. In exchange for dismissing all claims, we agreed to use certain branding going forward and we reached a settlement agreement in June 2016. In December 2019, Wag Hotels filed suit again claiming that the branding currently being used (“Wag”) violates the 2016 settlement agreement and infringes their trademark. In October 2021, we filed a Second Amended Answer and Counterclaim, and in November 2021, Wag Hotels moved to dismiss. In April 2022, the Court dismissed some of our affirmative defenses and counterclaim with leave to amend. Trial for this case is set for August 2023 and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against all claims.
