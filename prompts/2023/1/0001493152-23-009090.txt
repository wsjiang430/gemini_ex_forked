CORPORATE AND ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY
 
Background of XCEL
 
Our Company was incorporated in Delaware on July 15, 2005, as “Bluebird Exploration Company” (“Bluebird”). Bluebird was originally formed to engage in the exploitation of mineral properties. In December 2008, Bluebird changed its name to “Xcellink International, Inc.” (“XCEL”), and subsequently announced that its business plan was being expanded to include the development and marketing of platform-independent customer-centric payment systems and methodologies. XCEL was unable to raise the funds necessary to implement its business strategy, never generated any revenue and was reporting as a “shell” corporation. On January 9, 2014, Trxade Group, Inc., a privately held Nevada corporation, merged with and into XCEL, and XCEL changed its name to “Trxade Group, Inc.” On June 1, 2021, the Company changed its name from “Trxade Group, Inc” to “TRxADE HEALTH, INC.”

Background of Trxade
 
PharmaCycle LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (“PharmaCycle”), was formed in August 2010 by Prashant Patel, our President, to serve as a web-based market platform designed to enable trading among healthcare buyers and sellers of pharmaceuticals, accessories and services. In January 2013, PharmaCycle converted into a Florida corporation and changed its name to Trxade, Inc. (“Trxade Florida”). In May 2013, Trxade Florida created a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Trxade Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Trxade Nevada”). Trxade Nevada acquired Trxade Florida pursuant to a reverse triangular merger, resulting in Trxade Florida becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trxade Nevada (the “Nevada-Florida Merger”). The sole purpose of the Nevada-Florida Merger was to provide for a holding company to own Trxade Florida, the operating company. At all times, up to the Nevada-Florida Merger, Trxade Florida was capitalized exclusively by cash capital contributions from Messrs. Suren Ajjarapu and Patel, our Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively. Immediately following the Nevada-Florida Merger, Messrs. Ajjarapu and Patel collectively owned 99% of Trxade Nevada. After the Nevada-Florida Merger (but prior to the merger with XCEL), Trxade Nevada raised $670,000 through the sale of its preferred stock in private placements made to third party investors.
Reverse Merger with Trxade
 
On September 26, 2008, Mark Fingarson, the former President, sole Director and controlling shareholder of XCEL, sold 80,000,000 shares of XCEL (prior to the Merger Reverse Split and Reverse Stock Split (each discussed and defined below)) to XCEL’s then attorney, Ron McIntyre. On November 22, 2013, Trxade Nevada acquired Mr. McIntyre’s controlling interest of 80,000,000 shares in XCEL pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated November 7, 2013. At the time of the sale, XCEL had 104,160,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, including the 80,000,000 shares of stock acquired by Trxade Nevada (prior to the Merger Reverse Split and Reverse Stock Split (each discussed and defined below)).
 
On December 16, 2013, Trxade Nevada and XCEL entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) providing for the merger (the “Merger”) of Trxade Nevada with and into XCEL, with XCEL continuing as the surviving corporation. The Merger closed on January 8, 2014. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to “Trxade Group, Inc.,” and changed our trading symbol to “TRXD”.
 
Recapitalization of Common Stock by a Reverse Split and Increase of Authorized Shares of Stock
 
We also reversed our issued and outstanding stock at the ratio of one for one thousand (1:1,000) shares effective upon the closing of the Merger (the “Merger Reverse Split”). In connection with the Merger Reverse Split, 104,160,000 outstanding shares of our common stock, including the 80,000,000 shares held by Trxade Nevada, were exchanged for 104,160 post-Merger Reverse Split shares of common stock. As a result of the Merger, Trxade Nevada stockholders holding 28,800,000 shares of common stock and 670,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock converted their shares on a one-to-one basis into 28,800,000 shares of our common stock and 670,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, for an aggregate total of 29,470,000 shares. Further, 100,000 shares of our common stock (on a post-Reverse Split basis and considering the Reverse Stock Split (discussed below)) were issued following the Merger in connection with the conversion of our promissory notes. The 80,000,000 pre-Merger shares held by Trxade Nevada, which amounted to 13,334 shares (on a post-Reverse Split basis and taking into account the Reverse Stock Split), reverted to treasury stock of the Company. Except as otherwise disclosed, the share amounts in the paragraph above have not been adjusted for the Merger Reverse Split or the Reverse Stock Split.
 
February 2020 Reverse Stock Split and NASDAQ Capital Market Listing
 
On October 9, 2019, our Board of Directors, and on October 15, 2019, stockholders holding a majority of our outstanding voting shares, approved resolutions authorizing a reverse stock split of the outstanding shares of our common stock in the range from one-for-two (1-for-2) to one-for-ten (1-for-10), and provided authority to our Board of Directors to select the ratio of the reverse stock split in their discretion (the “Stockholder Authority”). On February 12, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a stock split ratio of 1-for-6 (“Reverse Stock Split”) in connection with the Stockholder Authority and the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of Delaware to affect the Reverse Stock Split. The Reverse Stock Split became effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 13, 2020. The Reverse Stock Split was completed in order to allow us to meet the initial listing criteria of The NASDAQ Capital Market.
 
Our common stock was approved for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “MEDS”, on February 13, 2020.

BUSINESS OF TRXADE
 
Company Overview
 
We are a health services IT company focused on digitalizing the retail pharmacy experience by optimizing drug procurement, the prescription journey and patient engagement in the U.S. and have designed and developed, and now own and operate, a business-to-business web-based marketplace. Our core service brings the nation’s independent pharmacies, accredited national suppliers, and manufacturers of pharmaceuticals together to provide efficient and transparent buying and selling opportunities.
 
We began operations as Trxade Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Trxade Nevada”) in August of 2010 and spent over two years creating and enhancing our web-based services. The Company changed its name on June 1, 2021, from “Trxade Group, Inc” to “TRxADE HEALTH, INC.” Our services provide pricing transparency, purchasing capabilities and other value-added services on a single platform focused on serving the nation’s approximately 19,397 independent pharmacies with annual purchasing power of $67.1 billion (according to the National Community of Pharmacists Association’s 2021 Digest). Our national wholesale supply partners and manufacturers are able to fulfill orders on our platform in real-time and provide pharmacies and wholesale suppliers with cost-saving payment terms and next-day delivery capabilities in unrestrictive states. We have expanded significantly since 2015 and now serve approximately 14,400+ registered members on our sales platform.
 
Our Principal Products and Services and their Markets
 
Trxade.com is a web-based pharmaceutical marketplace engaged in promoting and enabling commerce among independent pharmacies, small chains, hospitals, clinics, and alternate dispensing sites with large pharmaceutical suppliers nationally. Our marketplace has over 60 national and regional pharmaceutical suppliers providing over 120,000 branded and generic drugs, including over-the-counter drugs (OTCs), and drugs available for purchase by pharmacists. We serve approximately 14,400+ registered members, providing access to Trxade’s proprietary pharmaceutical database and data analytics regarding medication pricing. We generate revenue from these services by charging a transaction fee to the seller of the products for sales conducted via the Trxade platform. The buyers do not bear the cost of transaction fees for the purchases that they make, nor do they pay a fee to join or register with our platform. Substantially all of our revenues during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, were from platform revenue generated on www.rx.trxade.com, product sales through Integra Pharma Solutions, LLC, and prescription sales through Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC.
 
Status of current and new or enhanced products and services
 
We have a number of products and services in operation and others still under development, which are described below.
 
Integra Pharma Solutions, LLC. Integra is intended to serve as our logistics company for pharmaceutical distribution.

Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC. We acquired Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“CSP”), on October 15, 2018. CSP is an accredited pharmacy located in St. Petersburg, Florida, which focuses on specialty medications and operates with an innovative pharmacy model that offers home delivery services to any patient thereby providing convenience.
 
Delivmeds.com. Delivmeds.com was launched in late 2018 as a consumer-based app to provide delivery of pharmaceutical products associated with Alliance Pharma Solutions, LLC. We are currently working on reformulating the application from a prescription delivery portal to a fully integrated, interoperable, end-to-end prescription delivery and medication adherence tool. The new product has been rebranded and is targeted for consumer re-release and use in the near future. To date, we have not generated any revenue from this product.
 
Trxade Prime. Trxade Prime allows pharmacy members on the Trxade platform to process, consolidate and ship purchase orders that are placed directly with Trxade suppliers via the Trxade Prime. This service is provided at no cost, with the goal of offering a single tool with one low order minimum, one invoice, one package and one delivery from multiple quality wholesalers and distributors. Revenue has been generated from this service though our Integra subsidiary, which provides the consolidation of the orders.
 
Bonum Health Hub and Application. The “Bonum Health Hub”, a self-enclosed, free-standing virtual examination room, was launched by the Company’s wholly-owned Bonum Health, LLC subsidiary, in November 2019 and was expected to be operational in April 2020; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company does not anticipate installations moving forward, and has taken a write off of the hubs purchased at June 30, 2021 in the amount of $143,891, which is included under loss on inventory investments in the statement of operations for Fiscal 2021.
 
The “Bonum Health app,” which provides an overall healthcare experience comparable to a Primary Care practitioner, and an online portal as a personal electronic medical record and scheduling system is available on a subscription basis, primarily as a stand-alone telehealth software application that can be licensed on a business-to-business (B2B) model to clients as an employment health benefit for the clients’ employees. Revenue has been generated from this service through our Bonum subsidiary.
 
Bonum+ Business to Business (B2B). Bonum+ bundles telehealth, a COVID-19 risk assessment tool and a Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) purchasing tool, through a secure mobile dashboard for corporate clients. The B2B platform eases pressure on employees who are required to report any relevant health issues daily, centralizing communication and contact tracing to deliver risk scores. This allows employers to monitor employee COVID-19 risk profiles and streamlines the ordering of new PPE as needed. An integrated artificial intelligence (AI) tool offers health recommendations and connects employees with board certified physicians, as needed. To date, we have not generated any revenue from this product.
 
MedCheks Health Passport. The Health Passport is a patient-centered, digital, precision healthcare platform that lets patients consolidate and control their health data via a digital Health Passport and allows them to share their health profile, tests and vaccinations simply and safely. Secured in a blockchain, the Health Passport includes health and vaccination status verification via a QR code, which is available for travel, entry into stadiums, concert venues, events, offices, industrial plants, warehouses, and other physical access points. The Passport stores all of a user’s health records securely in one place. We have not generated any revenue from this product to date and the product was discontinued at the end of December 2021. We previously owned 100% of MedCheks, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company which was formed in January 2021, had no revenue in 2021 and was dissolved in December 2021.
 
SOSRx, LLC. On February 15, 2022, the Company entered into a relationship with Exchange Health, LLC, a technology company providing an online platform for manufacturers and suppliers to sell and purchase pharmaceuticals (“Exchange Health”). SOSRx LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“SOSRx”), was formed, which is owned 51% by the Company and 49% by Exchange Health. SOSRx did not generate material revenue and in February of 2023, subsequent to Fiscal 2022, the Company voluntarily withdrew from the joint venture agreement. The asset impairment is reflected in the statement of operations for Fiscal 2022 as impairment of intangible asset. Additionally, the Company contributed a cash investment of $275,000 in February of 2022 when the joint venture was formed. The Company did not recover this investment as part of the withdrawal settlement.
 
All of our product offerings are focused on the United States markets. Some products are restricted just to certain states, depending upon the various applicable state regulations and guidelines pertaining to pharmaceuticals, particularly, and drug businesses, generally. Our services are distributed through our online platform.

Organizational Structure
 
The diagram below depicts our current organizational structure:
 

The Pharmaceutical Industry
 
According to the NCPA 2020 Digest Report, United States pharmaceutical companies comprise a burgeoning estimated $685 billion industry by 2023, consisting of over 65,000 pharmacy facilities. Management believes that few platforms are currently in place to bring these participants together to share market knowledge, product pricing transparency and product availability. According to this, the pharmaceutical market is comprised primarily of three wholesalers that control an estimated approximately 92% of the market. Our management believes that this concentration has, over the years, led to a lack of price and cost transparency, thereby resulting in severe limitations on the purchasing choices of industry participants. These market dynamics have enabled these large wholesalers (McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen), known as ADR distributors, to dominate the industry with respect to both generic and brand pharmaceuticals.
 
To fuel this change, insurance companies (Pharmacy Benefits Management (“PBM”) and private health payers) and the federal government have initiated lower medication reimbursement payments to healthcare providers. We believe that pharmacies face increasing pressure to source medications as inexpensively as possible and improve operational efficiency. Trxade seeks to be in the forefront of solving these transparency and pricing concerns by providing independent, retail pharmacies with real-time, pharmacy acquisition cost (“PAC”) benchmarks to the National Drug Code (the “NDC”) standard. The NDC mark is a unique product identifier used in the United States for drugs intended for human use.
 
Competitive Business Conditions, Our Competitive Position in our Industry, and our Methods of Competition
 
We expect to face competition from the three large ADR distributors (McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen), other pharmaceutical distributors, buying groups, software products, and other start-up companies. Most of our competitors’ operations have substantially greater financial- and manufacturer-backed resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and more established relationships in the industry.
Other Start-up Companies Which Provide Competitive Services
 
We have identified start-ups that provide for supplier-pharmacy trading such as PharmaBid, RxCherrypick, PharmSaver, MatchRx and GenericBid, and provide web-based services similar to ours, allowing pharmacies to buy from several suppliers. Trxade differentiates itself from these exchanges by providing our pharmacies with both brand and generic pharmaceutical products. Additional companies target “direct-to-consumer” pharmacy deliveries, including Amazon.com’s PillPack, Capsule, Costplusdrugs, and GetRoman.com.
Buying Groups
 
Buying Groups provide discounted prices to their members by negotiating better pricing with one primary wholesaler, while charging administrative fees generally ranging from 3 to 5 percent. Some Buying Groups are structured like co-operatives (such as Independent Pharmacy Cooperative (IPC) and American Pharmacy Cooperative, Inc. (APCI)) and offer their members monthly or quarterly rebates. Although they can function well to bring pricing competition to the industry, they often offer rebates only after the purchase. Management does not believe Buying Groups will provide long-term savings to customers with this model given the increased transparency and competition in the industry.

12
--

Pharmaceutical Software
 
Some pharmaceutical software companies compete with us to varying degrees at different levels. SureCost, for example, provides inventory management software enabling pharmacies to comply with primary supplier contracts. This software is fee-based and requires training.
 
Pharmacies may be reluctant to buy pharmaceuticals on the internet due to the historical negativity and uncertainty with respect to the origin and purity of drugs purchased off the web. Trxade management believes that as we continue to develop our brand, our customer base, and our vast product offerings, we will gain the trust of the market and overcome the negativity associated with purchasing via a pharmaceutical online marketplace.
 
One advantage that we believe we have over our competition is our ability to be flexible and fast moving in adjusting our business model to address the needs of our customer base. Trxade started by offering pharmacies a reverse auction model to enhance savings on the purchase of their pharmaceuticals. Customer feedback suggested that pharmacies prefer a more “buy now” format, which we implemented. This resulted in a “one-stop-one-search” platform to buy quality pharmaceuticals for less and a data-rich platform to help pharmacies overcome the complexities related to supply chain purchasing.
 
Telehealth Providers
 
We also anticipate facing competition in the telehealth industry (in connection with Bonum Health) from current and future health care companies in the telehealth market including, Teladoc Health, Inc., MDLive, Inc., American Well Corporation and Grand Rounds, Inc., among other smaller industry participants.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers
 
Trxade is a web-based technology platform. Because we are not a manufacturing company, we do not need any raw materials. Our module on the platform is drug supplier-to-retailer. We bring buyers and sellers together on this platform. Our suppliers include National Apothecary Solutions, Integral RX, and South Pointe Wholesale, Inc.
Dependence on One or More Major Customers
 
As of the date of this filing, we have approximately 14,400+ registered members and over 30 pharmaceutical suppliers as customers, with an estimated market potential of approximately 20,000+ independent pharmacies and 1,500 regional and local suppliers. We have a working relationship with over 25 wholesalers and the nation’s largest buying group. Although we believe those entities are satisfied with their business relationship with Trxade, if our buying group and two or three of the largest wholesalers decided no longer to do business with Trxade, the resulting supplier void would materially and adversely affect our competitiveness in the marketplace.
Intellectual Property
 
Although we believe that our name and brand are protected by applicable state common law trademark laws, we do not currently have any patents, concessions, licenses, royalty agreements, or franchises, provided that we do currently maintain a number of registered trademarks and our pharmaceutical pricing benchmarks, PAC. Our business operates under a proprietary software system which includes trade secrets within our database, business practices and pricing model. We also maintain a number of websites.
 
We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party.
 
Need for Government Approval of Products and Services
 
We are required to hold business licenses and to follow applicable state and federal government regulations detailed herein. In October 2018, we acquired Community Specialty Pharmacy, LLC, an accredited independent retail pharmacy with a focus on specialty medications, which requires state approval, which have been obtained in 36 states.

Effect of Existing or Probable Government Regulations on the Business
 
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
 
On August 16, 2022, President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, lowering the cost of prescription drugs. The law will also phase in a cap for out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions and establish a $35 monthly cap per prescription for insulin covered by a Medicare prescription drug plan and insulin delivered through traditional pumps. Other items included in the law provide for $0 out-of-pocket expense for certain adult vaccines including the shingles vaccine, Medicare rebates to be paid by companies to Medicare beneficiaries if the increase drug prices at a rate larger than the rate of inflation, and also allows the Secretary of HHS the power to negotiate prices for select high-cost prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. These restrictions to out-of-pocket expenses, monthly caps, and control of prescription drug prices may be too significant for many smaller suppliers and pharmacies to overcome.
The Ryan Haight Act
 
On April 6, 2009, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) published the interim final rule of the Ryan Haight Oline Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 (The Act”), the final rule was effective October 30, 2020. The Act requires an in-person medical evaluation for prescribing practitioners and modified registration requirements for online pharmacies that distribute controlled substances. The Act also assigns responsibility to distributors to avoid supplying pharmacies that service customers of inappropriate websites and requires distributors to have responsibility to know pharmacy buying patterns and to confirm their compliance with modified pharmacy registration requirements. The burden of the additional cost to online pharmacies to comply with the modified registration requirements may be too much and the risks to distributors to supply controlled substances to pharmacies that have websites may be too great.
 
Proposed Rule by DEA on 11/17/2021 re: Regulation of Telepharmacy Practice
 
On November 17, 2021, the DEA published advanced notice of proposed rulemaking to obtain further information regarding the practice of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy is not specifically defined by the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”) or DEA regulations. However, to the extent that telepharmacies dispense controlled substances, they are under the purview of the CSA and DEA. The DEA has opened the comment period to January 18, 2022, to obtain information in an effort to be fully informed about the practice, industry, and state regulation of telepharmacy. New regulations could have an impact on pharmacies and could affect our business.
 
Federal Drug Administration Guidelines
 
On April 12, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA), setting the baseline for wholesale distribution regulations. The final regulations were published in 1999, establishing the minimum wholesale distribution requirements for state licensure. With the intent to prevent the introduction and retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or counterfeit drugs into the distribution system, state licensing systems moved to update their standards to match those provided federally as guided under FDA’s Guidelines for State Licensing of Wholesale Prescription Drug Distributors (21 CFR 205). PDMA established minimum federal pedigree requirements to trace the ownership of prescription drugs through the supply chain. The principal goal of the PDMA was to further secure the nation’s drug supply from counterfeit and substandard prescription drugs. The law establishes two types of distributors: “Authorized distributor[s] of record” or ADRs; and “Unauthorized distributor[s],” such as wholesalers. The pedigree requirement was to require each person engaged in the wholesale distribution of a prescription drug in interstate commerce, who is not the manufacturer or an authorized distributor of record for that drug, to provide a pedigree to the recipient. After meeting resistance from various stakeholders, the FDA delayed the effective date of the regulations several times, until final implementation in December 2006.
 
At the federal level the implementation of the track and trace legislation which went into effect in 2018, requires the use of pharmaceutical pedigree to track the movement of pharmaceuticals along the supply chain. The costs of complying with this new legislation may be too burdensome for many of the smaller suppliers.
 
State Drug Administration Guidelines
 
There are a number of national and state-wide regulations that have an effect on our business. All drug wholesalers must be licensed under state licensing systems, which must in turn meet the FDA guidelines under State Licensing of Wholesale Prescription Drug Distributors (21 CFR Part 205). The regulations set forth minimum requirements for prescription drug storage and security as well as for the treatment of returned, damaged, and outdated prescription drugs. Further, wholesale drug distributors must establish and maintain inventories and records of all transactions regarding the receipt and distribution of prescription drugs and make these available for inspection and copying by authorized federal, state, or local law enforcement officials. In most states, wholesale distributor licenses are issued by the State Boards of Pharmacy and require periodic renewal. Approximately 40 states also require out-of-state wholesalers that distribute drugs within their borders to be licensed as well.

On February 4, 2022, the FDA published a proposed rule to set national standards for the licensing of prescription drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. The comment period was open until June 6, 2022. New regulations and requirements for wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers could be too burdensome and could impact our registered suppliers on the Trxade platform.
 
California, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Indiana define the normal distribution channel to not include the lateral sales of pharmaceuticals between wholesalers. The Supply Chain Act, part of the Quality Drug Act, which was signed into federal law in December 2013, precludes all states from restricting, investigating or inspecting the distribution channel and transactional history. Until the federal government provides guidelines for the new federal law, no state regulation or guideline exists.
 
The warehousing of pharmaceuticals is also restricted and requires additional state licenses. Some licenses require bonds and written exams and may take some time to approve. Currently, Integra Pharma Solutions, LLC, our wholesale distributor, asks for formal pedigrees from the ADR wholesalers and provides pedigrees to those entities they sell to in the marketplace. This requirement limits liability and provides assurance if a recall is warranted that Trxade and its participants will receive value for the commodity.
 
Our national wholesale supply partners are able to fulfill orders on our platform in real-time and provide pharmacies with cost-saving payment terms and next-day delivery capabilities in unrestrictive states under the Model State Pharmacy Act and Model Rules of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (Model Act).
 
Potential New Regulations; Price Gouging Rules
 
In addition to the above, regulatory mandates in response to certain unexpected events, such as viral outbreaks, could negatively impact sales. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a coronavirus surfaced in China and resulted in governments around the world adopting restrictions on public gatherings, travel and restrictions on companies’ (including our) ability to conduct normal business operations.
 
Price gouging may be an issue in the coming months due to the continued effects of the coronavirus and responses thereto and supply chain issues associated therewith and separately; as of the date of this Report, 42 states have enacted price gouging laws of one kind or another. The laws vary from state to state, but one constant throughout is a prohibition to charge “excessive” or “unconscionable” prices for consumer goods. Some states define “excessive” or “unconscionable” while others define what makes a prima facie case for price gouging and what constitutes a prima facie defense, shifting the burden of proof to the accuser. In almost all of the 42 states with price gouging laws on the books, a price is excessive or unconscionable if the price of a good has increased, in some states by a certain percentage, over the price of the good prior to the onset of the abnormal disruption of the market. Some states have clearly excepted from the price gouging definition a rise in prices caused by an increase in the merchant’s cost of delivering that good for sale – whether it be increased shipping costs, gasoline prices or simply the cost of the good itself. Other states have less defined exceptions – Virginia for example only treats the fact of increased input costs as a merchant’s prima facie defense to an accusation of price gouging. Several states except from the price gouging definition prices that do not exceed a normal margin (i.e., the merchant’s margin immediately prior to the market disruption) PLUS 10%. In general, while the law may not specifically define what constitutes an “unconscionably excessive price,” the statutes typically provide that a price may be “unconscionably excessive” if: the amount charged represents a “gross disparity” from the price such goods or services were sold or offered for sale immediately prior to the onset of the abnormal disruption of the market. Merchants may provide evidence that justifies their higher prices were justified by increased costs beyond their control. We will need to comply with the excessive price statutes; as of the date of this Report, we believe we were in compliance with all 42 states’ price gouging laws.
 
U.S. Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Federal Stark Law
 
We are subject to the federal self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. Where applicable, this law prohibits a physician from referring Medicare patients to an entity providing “designated health services” if the physician or a member of such physician’s immediate family has a “financial relationship” with the entity, unless an exception applies. The penalties for violating the Stark Law include the denial of payment for services ordered in violation of the statute, mandatory refunds of any sums paid for such services, civil penalties, disgorgement and possible exclusion from future participation in the federally funded healthcare programs. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibitions may be subject to fines for each applicable arrangement or scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law can be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act (described below) based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
 
We are also subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly worded and prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce, (i) the referral of a person covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, (ii) the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs or (iii) the purchasing, leasing or ordering or arranging or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, as discussed below. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties and fines. Imposition of any of these remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Federal False Claims Act & HIPAA
 
The federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies under the federal False Claims Act. Penalties include significant civil monetary penalties for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines, be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, or be subject to integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 
There are other federal anti-fraud laws that that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
Additionally, HIPAA established two federal crimes for healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of either of these statutes is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs, or integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance.
 
State Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program. A determination of liability under such state fraud and abuse laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Other Healthcare Laws
 
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, established several separate criminal penalties for making false or fraudulent claims to insurance companies and other non-governmental payors of healthcare services. Under HIPAA, these two additional federal crimes are: “Healthcare Fraud” and “False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters.” The Healthcare Fraud statute prohibits knowingly and recklessly executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The False Statements Relating to Healthcare Matters statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact by any trick, scheme or device or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. These provisions are intended to punish some of the same conduct in the submission of claims to private payors as the federal False Claims Act covers in connection with governmental health programs.
 
In addition, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federally funded healthcare programs and employing or contracting with individuals or entities who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. Moreover, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services may be liable for civil monetary penalties for each wrongful act. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the Anti-Kickback Statute and civil False Claims Act, which can impose additional penalties associated with the wrongful act. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payers may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud.

Climate Change Regulation
 
The U.S. government and foreign governments are currently in the process of considering new or expanded laws to address climate change. Such laws, if adopted, may include limitations on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climate-related matters, additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, and other requirements. Compliance with climate-related laws may be further complicated by different regulatory approaches and requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. New or expanded climate-related laws could impose substantial costs on us. Until the timing and extent of climate-related laws are clarified, we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures or our results of operations.
Environmental Regulations
 
Our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. We are not aware of any costs or effects of our compliance with environmental laws.
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:
 

● | Exemptions for “emerging growth companies” from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act; 
● | Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; 
● | Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and 
● | Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements. 

 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an “emerging growth company” if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was affected after December 8, 2011, and the company had less than $1.07 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” after the earliest of
 

(i) | the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, 
------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO; 
(iii) | the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 
(iv) | the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Exchange Act. 

 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.

Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the Securities Act, will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:
 

(i) | audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years (provided that “smaller reporting companies” such as the Company are only required to provide two years of financial statements); 
------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ii) | selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited (provided that “smaller reporting companies” such as the Company are not required to provide selected financial data as required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K); and 
(iii) | executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for “smaller reporting companies”. 

 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs to include audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years with no required tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from having to comply with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.
 
The JOBS Act further exempts an “emerging growth company” from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Exchange Act for companies with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act to hold stockholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an “emerging growth company” regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition, the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of research reports on the “emerging growth company’s” initial public offerings (IPOs).
 
Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” to submit registration statements under the Securities Act on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show (which time period has since been reduced to 15 days). This is intended to allow “emerging growth companies” to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.

Status as Emerging Growth Company. Our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act occurred on or around May 2019. As such, we will remain an emerging growth company, until no later than December 31, 2024, the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the Company’s IPO.
 
Research and Development.

During the last two fiscal years, Trxade.com, DelivMeds and Bonum Health have been developed as proprietary software. In Fiscal 2022, management determined that the research and development costs could be capitalized due to the stage of development for DelivMeds. The capitalized asset for Fiscal 2022 was $450,845. For Fiscal 2021 $509,210 was spent by the Company in research and development activities, which were included in technology expenses. None of these expenses were borne directly by customers.
Employees
 
Currently, we have approximately 33 full-time employees and one part time employee. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentives earnings for both short-term and long-term performance such as health insurance, paid time off and flexibility schedules. To empower employees to unleash their potential, we provide onboarding training, development mentorship with C-suite executives, and one on one coaching. The Company believes that its rich culture of inclusion and diversity enables it to create, develop and fully leverage the strength of its workforce to exceed customer expectation and meet its growth objectives. The Company places a high value on diversity and inclusion.
 
We also utilize numerous outside consultants. Our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees and consultants to be satisfactory.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is not directly affected by seasonal fluctuations but is affected indirectly by the fall and winter flu season, to the extent it leads to an increased demand for certain generic pharmaceuticals.
