Overview



OpGen, Inc. (the “Company”) is a precision medicine company harnessing the power of molecular diagnostics and informatics to help combat infectious disease. Along with its subsidiaries, Curetis GmbH and Ares Genetics GmbH, the Company is developing and commercializing molecular microbiology solutions helping to guide clinicians with more rapid and actionable information about life threatening infections to improve patient outcomes and decrease the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, or MDROs. The Company’s current product portfolio includes Unyvero, Acuitas AMR Gene Panel, and the ARES Technology Platform including ARESdb, NGS technology and AI-powered bioinformatics solutions for AMR surveillance, outbreak analysis, and antibiotic response prediction including ARESiss, ARESid, ARESasp, and AREScloud, as well as the Curetis CE-IVD-marked PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit. The Company exited its FISH business in early 2021, and the Company's license agreement with Life Technologies, a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher, was terminated as of June 30, 2021.



Following its initial announcement in October 2020, the Company discontinued its QuickFISH and PNA FISH product portfolio in its entirety during the first quarter of 2021 (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report). The Company's FISH customers and distribution partners had been informed accordingly and last orders were received and processed in the first quarter of 2021. The discontinuance of these product lines did not qualify for discontinued operations reporting.



On January 5, 2023, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1 post-reverse-split share for every 20 pre-reverse-split shares. The common stock continues to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “OPGN” and began trading on a split-adjusted basis on January 5, 2023. All share amounts and per share prices in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split.



The focus of OpGen is on its combined broad portfolio of products, which includes high impact rapid diagnostics and bioinformatics to interpret AMR genetic data. The Company currently expects to focus on the following products for lower respiratory infection, urinary tract infection and invasive joint infection:




● | The Unyvero Lower Respiratory Tract, or LRT, test (e.g., for bacterial pneumonias) is the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared test that can be used for the detection of more than 90% of common causative agents of pneumonia in hospitalized patients. According to the National Center for Health Statistics (2018), pneumonia is a leading cause of admissions to the hospital and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. It also increases in elderly patients, transplant, cancer or other immunocompromised patients. The Unyvero LRT automated test detects 19 pathogens within less than five hours, with approximately two minutes of hands-on time and provides clinicians with a comprehensive overview of 10 genetic antibiotic resistance markers. The Company has commercialized the Unyvero LRT BAL test for testing bronchoalveolar lavage, or BAL, specimens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections following FDA clearance received by Curetis in December 2019. The Unyvero LRT BAL automated test simultaneously detects 20 pathogens and 10 antibiotic resistance markers, and it is the first and only FDA-cleared panel that also includes Pneumocystis jirovecii, a key fungal pathogen often found in immunocompromised patients (such as AIDS and transplant patients) that can be difficult to diagnose, as the 20th pathogen on the panel. The Company believes the Unyvero LRT and LRT BAL tests have the ability to help address a significant, previously unmet medical need that causes over $10 billion in annual costs for the U.S. healthcare system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.

● | Following registration of the Unyvero instrument system as an in vitro diagnostics (IVD) platform for the Chinese market in early 2021, the Company is supporting its strategic partner Beijing Clear Biotech (BCB) in pursuing execution of a supplemental clinical trial with the Unyvero Hospitalized Pneumonia (HPN) test. As requested by the Chinese regulatory authority National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), this study is geared towards generating additional data in China that will complement a larger data set with data from abroad compiled from other clinical and analytical studies performed in the past. Due to the continued impact of strict COVID-19 restrictions in China during 2022, the initiation of this supplementary study has been delayed, and the timing for its initiation remains uncertain. In the third quarter of 2022, regulatory advisors to BCB informed OpGen that the NMPA implemented a mandatory new electronic filing regime that requires the Company to re-submit its clinical trial plan under the new regime. The regulatory advisors currently estimate a total duration for the review and approval process to be between 24 to 30 months, and during that time, the clinical study is believed to take approximately 10 to 12 months.

● | The Unyvero Urinary Tract Infection, or UTI, test, which is CE-IVD-marked in Europe, is currently being made available to laboratories in the United States as a research use only, or RUO, kit. The test detects a broad range of pathogens as well as antimicrobial resistance markers directly from native urine specimens. The Company had initiated a prospective multi-center clinical trial for the Unyvero UTI in the United States in the third quarter of 2021 and completed enrollment of more than 1,800 patient samples by the end of the third quarter of 2022. Following the announcement of preliminary top line data in December 2022, the Company currently expects to conclude reference testing in early 2023, followed by a subsequent submission to the FDA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Unyvero Invasive Joint Infection, or IJI, test, which is a variant of the ITI cartridge being developed for the U.S. market, has also been selected for analytical and clinical performance evaluation on the Unyvero A30 platform including clinical trials towards a future submission to the FDA. Such clinical trial is not expected to start before the second half of 2023 and will be subject to availability and funding. Microbial diagnosis of IJI is difficult because of challenges in sample collection, usually at surgery, and patients being on prior antibiotic therapy which minimizes the chances of recovering viable bacteria. The Company believes that Unyvero IJI could be useful in identifying pathogens as well as their antimicrobial resistance, or AMR, markers to help guide optimal antibiotic treatment for these patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In September 2021, the Company received clearance from the FDA for its Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for bacterial isolates. The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel detects 28 genetic AMR markers in isolated bacterial colonies from 26 different pathogens. The Company believes the panel provides clinicians with a valuable diagnostic tool that informs about potential AMR patterns early and supports appropriate antibiotic treatment decisions in this indication. During 2022, the Company signed two commercial customer contracts and installed the first two systems for the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel for isolates. The Company expects to enter into additional commercial contracts that are currently in its funnel of contract proposals during 2023.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In September 2022, the Company entered into a research and development, or R&D, collaboration agreement with the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), the global alliance for diagnostics, to assist in funding the development of the Unyvero A30 RQ platform for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The initial project focuses on a feasibility study for the rapid detection of AMR markers from blood culture. The feasibility phase of this R&D project is set to conclude in the first half of 2023 and is funded by FIND for €0.7 million (approximately $0.7 million).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In October 2022, the Company announced that its subsidiary Curetis and BioVersys AG, a Swiss biotech company developing novel antibiotics against drug resistant infections, entered into a collaboration agreement. Under that collaboration agreement, BioVersys will be using the Unyvero systems and HPN tests at all its sites for its upcoming BV100 phase II clinical trial.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company is also developing novel bioinformatics tools and solutions to accompany or augment its current and potential future IVD products and may seek regulatory clearance for such bioinformatics tools and solutions to the extent they would be required either as part of its portfolio of IVD products or even as a standalone bioinformatics product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Company commenced offering validated high-quality sequencing and analysis services with rapid turnaround times for key applications in microbiology from our Ares Genetics laboratory in Vienna, Austria. The unique and differentiated offering for rapid and comprehensive genetic characterization of bacterial isolates and interpretive services include whole genome sequencing, taxonomic identification and typing, detection of plasmids, and other mobile elements, AMR, and virulence markers. Furthermore, the RUO services provided by OpGen’s laboratory in Rockville, MD, will provide prediction of genomic antibiotic susceptibility based on the Company’s ARESdb database as well as specialized software for bacterial outbreak analysis via the Company’s AREScloud web application. These technologies are particularly applicable to programs of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC), antibiotic stewardship and surveillance, all of which are part of the U.S. national strategy to protect against rising antimicrobial resistance.

OpGen’s combined AMR bioinformatics offerings, when and if such products are cleared for marketing, will offer important new tools to clinicians treating patients with AMR infections. OpGen’s subsidiary Ares Genetics’ ARESdb is a comprehensive database of genetic and phenotypic information. ARESdb was originally designed based on the Siemens microbiology strain collection covering resistant pathogens and its development has significantly expanded, as a result of transferring data from the discontinued Acuitas Lighthouse into ARESdb to now cover more than 130,000 bacterial isolates that have been sequenced using Next Generation Sequencing, or NGS, technology and tested for susceptibility with applicable antibiotics from a range of over 100 antimicrobial drugs. In late 2021, Ares Genetics entered into a strategic database access deal with one of the world’s leading microbiology and IVD corporations for their non-exclusive access to approximately 1.1% of Ares Genetics’ total database asset at the time of signing. Ares Genetics continues to explore various discussions with several interested parties in potential future collaboration or licensing opportunities. Additional partnerships with a U.S. Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, certified laboratory, a contract research organization, or CRO, a major University Medical Center, the Belgian national reference laboratory at the University Hospital Leuven as well as several U.S. state public health labs have been initiated and are ongoing and the collaboration master service agreement with Sandoz has been extended until January 2025.



In addition to potential future licensing and partnering, Ares Genetics intends to independently utilize the proprietary biomarker content in this database, as well as to build an independent business in NGS and Artificial Intelligence, or AI, based offerings for AMR research and diagnostics in collaboration with its current and potential future partners in the life science, pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries. Ares Genetics’ customers for such offerings include Siemens Technology Accelerator and academic, public health, healthcare and biotechnology institutions from the United States and various European countries.



Our Unyvero A50 system tests for up to 130 diagnostic targets (pathogens and resistance genes) in under five hours with approximately two minutes of hands-on time. The system was first CE-IVD-marked in 2012 and was FDA-cleared in 2018 along with the LRT test through a De Novo request. The Unyvero A30 RQ is a new device designed to address the low-to mid-plex testing market for 5-30 DNA targets and to provide results in approximately 30 to 90 minutes with 2 to 5 minutes of hands-on time. The Unyvero A30 RQ has a small benchtop footprint and has an attractive cost of goods profile. Curetis has been following a partnering strategy for the Unyvero A30 RQ and, following the successful completion of a key development milestone, Curetis has completed verification and validation testing of the A30 RQ instruments and, in addition to the new collaboration with FIND, is actively engaged in ongoing partnering discussions and due diligence.



The Company has extensive partner and distribution relationships to help accelerate the establishment of a global infectious disease diagnostic testing and informatics business. The Company’s partners include A. Menarini Diagnostics S.r.l. for Pan-European distribution of the Unyvero A50 product line to currently 12 countries and Beijing Clear Biotech Co. Ltd. for Unyvero A50 product distribution in China. The Company has a network of other distributors covering countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.



OpGen will continue to develop and seek FDA and other regulatory clearances or approvals, as applicable, for its Unyvero UTI and IJI products as well as for its Unyvero A30 RQ platform. OpGen will continue to offer the FDA-cleared Unyvero LRT and LRT BAL Panels, and FDA-cleared Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests, as well as the Unyvero UTI Panel as RUO products to hospitals, public health departments, clinical laboratories, pharmaceutical companies and CROs in the United States. Curetis continues its efforts in ensuring compliance with the new In-Vitro-Diagnostic Device Regulation (IVDR) in the European Union (EU), which officially went into effect in May 2022. Given the limited number of designated EU Notified Bodies at this time, and with the EU commission IVDR amendment in early 2022 providing for multi-year grace periods for certain IVD products with former In-Vitro-Diagnostic Device Directive (IVDD) CE marking, it is now possible for Curetis to continue its portfolio of existing CE-IVD-marked products until at least May 2025 and May 2026, respectively, as long as no material changes are being made to any of its products. Following May 2022, however, any new or changed CE-marked products will be required to be IVDR compliant from the outset.



The Company’s headquarters are in Rockville, Maryland, and its principal operations are in Rockville, Maryland, and Holzgerlingen and Bodelshausen, both in Germany. The Company also has operations in Vienna, Austria. The Company operates in one business segment.

OpGen’s Products and Products in Development



Through its wholly owned subsidiary Curetis GmbH, OpGen maintains a comprehensive portfolio of molecular diagnostics for rapid infectious disease and AMR testing. At the core of the portfolio is the Unyvero Platform and product family, which is developed, manufactured and commercialized by Curetis. On the bioinformatics side, OpGen has integrated data from its now discontinued Acuitas Lighthouse into the Ares Genetics GmbH (Ares) ARESdb. Ares develops and commercializes its NGS as well as AI-powered prediction models and solutions to partners and customers in the pharma, biotech and diagnostics industries as well as to public research institutions.



OpGen is a molecular diagnostics company that focuses on the development and commercialization of reliable, fast and cost-effective products for diagnosing severe infectious diseases in hospitalized patients, a treatment area with a high unmet medical need and significant prevalence in developed countries. Our unique Unyvero A50 Platform currently comprises the Unyvero System with the Unyvero A50 Analyzer at its core, proprietary software, and single use Application Cartridges. These Application Cartridges contain molecular tests addressing specific severe infectious diseases and detect a broad range of pathogens relevant in a given indication and associated toxin genes and genetic antimicrobial resistance markers.



The Unyvero A50 Platform has been CE-IVD-marked since 2012 and is commercialized in Europe and certain other markets that accept CE-IVD-marking or where it has successfully passed the registration process (i.e. Colombia, Kuwait, and Singapore), and has been rolled out commercially in the United States following De Novo clearance of the Unyvero A50 System and the LRT Application Cartridge by the FDA in April 2018 and the 510(k) clearance of the LRT Application for BAL samples in December 2019.



Today, the diagnosis of infectious diseases in the hospital setting is still largely carried out through traditional culture-based microbiology methods. This process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, typically delivering results only after 24 to 72 hours or, in some cases, weeks. As a result, informed antibiotic therapy decisions may be delayed, which can lead to poor patient outcomes, including higher mortality rates for indications such as pneumonia and sepsis, longer hospital stays, increased hospital costs and overall spread of antibiotic resistance, a significant and increasing problem throughout the world. All of these factors pose clinical and economic challenges to hospitals and a significant threat to public health globally.



OpGen aims to improve on this standard-of-care by offering comprehensive test information in a timely manner that allows for early, efficacious treatment, which OpGen believes results in improved clinical and health economic outcomes. The Company’s Unyvero A50 Platform delivers results within four to five hours and can cover over 100 diagnostic targets. The broad Unyvero A50 test panels (commonly referred to as Application Cartridges) also allow the identification of microorganisms that are difficult to culture and hence missed in culture-based test methods, as well as rare but critical pathogens not routinely tested for by standard methods, a conclusion confirmed by a number of clinical studies. The Application Cartridges are single-use, disposable, and disease specific. The FDA clinical trial for the Company’s LRT Application Cartridge concluded that the Unyvero A50 System identified 32 positive atypical pathogen results in 1,653 prospectively tested specimens, as opposed to only four confirmed positive atypical pathogen results identified in 116 specimens from this cohort using traditional culture-based diagnostic methods. The Company believes this allows clinicians to make early adjustments to the specific treatment of the patient, saving significant time and cost, in particular by reducing the duration of the patient’s hospital stay.



The Unyvero A50 Platform is intended to complement rather than replace traditional microbiology-based diagnostics testing. OpGen believes, however, that timely diagnosis of the underlying pathogens and their resistances could greatly improve outcomes for patients and is likely to provide net savings to hospitals.



The Unyvero A50 Platform is marketed through a combination of direct sales in the United States and a growing network of distribution partners in Europe, Middle East, the ASEAN Region, Asia and Latin America. As of December 31, 2022, the distribution network comprises 13 distributors covering 32 countries in those regions with regulatory clearance for the Unyvero A50 System and the Unyvero Application Cartridges in some of these countries still pending.



There are currently seven commercially available Unyvero A50 Application Cartridges, consisting of:




● | the HPN Application Cartridge, which addresses severe forms of pneumonia and is CE-IVD-marked in Europe;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the ITI Application Cartridge, which addresses severe cases of implant and tissue infections and is CE-IVD-marked in Europe;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the BCU Application Cartridge, which addresses severe blood stream infections and is CE-IVD-marked in Europe;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the IAI Application Cartridge, which addresses intra-abdominal infections and is CE-IVD-marked in Europe;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The UTI Application Cartridge, which addresses severe urinary tract infections and is CE-IVD-marked in Europe. The Company has performed extensive analytical and clinical performance evaluations, including completion of enrollment of more than 1,800 patient samples for its clinical trial in the U.S. during 2022. Following the announcement of preliminary top line data in December 2022, we currently expect to conclude reference testing in early 2023 and expect a subsequent submission to the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the LRT Application Cartridge, which is technically similar to the HPN Application Cartridge and also addresses severe forms of pneumonia, which was cleared by the FDA in April 2018 for use with tracheal aspirates and is being marketed and commercialized in the United States; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the LRT BAL Application Cartridge was cleared on December 20, 2019 by the FDA for use with BAL specimens and is being marketed and commercialized in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the current Unyvero A50 System, the Company, through its subsidiary Curetis, also develops its Unyvero A30 RQ Analyzer module designed to offer a rapid time-to-result (potentially as fast as 30 to 90 minutes), qualitative and, where needed, quantitative real-time PCR testing in a cartridge format that can provide up to 11 parallel multiplex (i.e. simultaneously running multiple assays in one reaction) PCR reactions from one sample, with up to three assays per reaction (for a total of up to 33 assays per cartridge). The Unyvero A30 RQ Analyzer is expected to be operated on a stand-alone basis or fully integrated into the Unyvero System suite of products with respect to system architecture, design, software and handling, thereby expanding the Unyvero Platform to include low- and mid-plex capabilities. We expect that the costs of the Unyvero A30 RQ Analyzer and cartridges will be lower than those for the current Unyvero A50 System and its Application Cartridges, potentially opening up commercial opportunities in the medium multiplexing infectious disease testing market segment. Initially developed as an expansion of the Unyvero platform, complementing the Unyvero A50 high-plex Application Cartridges with low- to mid-plex Unyvero A30 RQ Application Cartridges for infectious diseases, OpGen adjusted its strategy and now also seeks partners in the global IVD industry that may want to access the Unyvero A30 RQ for commercialization of their own assays on this platform, potentially even as legal manufacturer under their own branding.



The Unyvero A50 Platform



Curetis launched its CE-IVD-marked Unyvero A50 Platform with a first disposable Application Cartridge for pneumonia in 2012. The FDA cleared the Unyvero A50 System and LRT Application Cartridge in April 2018 and the LRT BAL Application Cartridge in December 2019.



The Unyvero A50 Platform is a highly automated sample-to-answer molecular diagnostics platform, based on multiplexed end-point PCR with an array-based detection process. It integrates fully automated sample preparation, analysis and identification of disease relevant pathogens and antibiotic resistance markers to provide timely high-quality information to its end-users. The scalable system is designed to be either placed in laboratory settings or directly in hospital wards or intensive care units. Time-to-result is four to five hours for the different Application Cartridges commercially available today, including 30 minutes of automated sample preparation (lysis) and total hands-on time of no more than five minutes. The Unyvero A50 Platform’s intuitive workflow with only minimal hands-on time enables non-specialty trained personnel to perform molecular tests at the point of need, such as intensive care units, or ICUs.



Unyvero A50 Platform, System Components and Workflow



The Unyvero A50 System consists of three devices, the Unyvero L4 Lysator, the Unyvero C8 Cockpit and the Unyvero A50 Analyzer. The Unyvero L4 Lysator is used for sample pre-processing and pathogen lysis. The Unyvero C8 Cockpit is the control panel for the Unyvero L4 Lysator and Unyvero A50 Analyzer and displays the results of patient sample analysis. The Unyvero A50 Analyzer integrates mechanical, electronic, pneumatic and optical elements and enables a fully automatic random-access processing of the Application Cartridges. The Application Cartridges are single-use, disposable and disease specific. The Unyvero System, together with proprietary software and the Application Cartridges, comprise the Unyvero A50 Platform.

The Unyvero L4 Lysator 



The Unyvero L4 Lysator instrument is used for sample pre-processing and pathogen lysis. It performs proprietary software-controlled lysis of up to four samples, simultaneously within 30 minutes, combining mechanical, thermal, enzymatic and chemical lysis steps and allows the use of a wide range of native sample types due to a proprietary sample processing method (in respect of which several patents have been granted or are currently pending). Biofilm-forming pathogens, which are very difficult to break-up and culture by traditional methods, can be detected by the Unyvero A50 Platform. In addition, the Unyvero A50 Platform is CE-IVD-marked for a broad variety of native patient sample types including sputum, (mini) BAL, tracheal aspirates, aspirates and exudates, catheter tips, pus, sonication fluid, synovial fluid, swabs and tissue. The lysis of further sample types such as blood, urine, stool and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues is also possible with the proprietary Unyvero lysis method. Up to two Unyvero L4 Lysators can be attached to a single Unyvero C8 Cockpit to allow processing of up to eight samples simultaneously within 30 minutes.
The Unyvero C8 Cockpit 



The Unyvero C8 Cockpit device is the control panel for the Unyvero L4 Lysator and Unyvero A50 Analyzer. It has a touchscreen and built-in bar code reader and runs on proprietary in-house developed Unyvero software. Step-by-step instructions guide the user from preparing a test to executing the fully automated process in the Unyvero A50 Analyzer in just a few minutes. The results display, storage of results and data storage, as well as information about the performed tests including the Application Cartridges’ shelf life and lot numbers, are generated automatically. Data can be exported as PDF-formatted files via a USB key or to a connected printer. It also features built-in interfaces for possible future connectivity to standard hospital and laboratory information systems.
The Unyvero A50 Analyzer



The Unyvero A50 Analyzer instrument consists of mechanical, electronic, pneumatic and optical elements and enables a fully-automatic random-access processing of the Application Cartridges. Once a run is started, the Unyvero A50 Analyzer automatically executes and controls all sample processing and analysis steps (including DNA extraction, DNA purification, PCR set-up, highly multiplexed end-point PCR amplification and a hybridization array-based fluorescence detection) inside the Application Cartridge. For safety and equipment longevity, and to avoid issues of calibration or waste-removal, the Unyvero A50 Analyzer contains neither reagents nor waste. All fluids are handled within the sealed Application Cartridge. Up to four Unyvero A50 Analyzers can be attached to a single Unyvero C8 Cockpit and each Unyvero A50 Analyzer includes the two available slots that provide full random access per Unyvero A50 Analyzer, allowing the processing of up to eight patient samples simultaneously within four to five hours. In the future, OpGen believes a further expansion to up to eight Unyvero A50 Analyzers will also be possible.

Workflow



The Unyvero A50 Platform is a modular, flexible easy-to-use platform, which substantially reduces turnaround time from up to 24 hours or even weeks for traditional microbiology culture-based tests to approximately four to five hours. This allows physicians to adjust treatment at a much earlier stage than with the traditional microbiology culture-based test, which is the current clinical standard of care. OpGen believes that the reduced hands-on time of no more than five minutes (following 30 minutes of automated sample preparation) and the intuitive workflow make the system operable by non-specialty trained personnel and reduce the risks of errors. 
Unyvero A50 Application Cartridge Portfolio


Figure 3: Currently available Application Cartridges



The HPN and LRT Application Cartridges



The HPN Application Cartridge was commercially launched in April 2015 and is the second-generation version of the P50 Application Cartridge, the Pneumonia Application Cartridge originally launched in 2012. It is a CE-IVD-marked Application Cartridge for the fully automated performance of currently 21 PCR assays for microorganisms and 19 PCR assays for antibiotic resistance markers combined in a total of eight multiplex PCR reactions on native respiratory samples, such as sputum, tracheal aspirates and BAL fluids with no pre-culturing required. This Application Cartridge combines the necessary detection of bacteria, fungus and resistance markers into a single test to aid diagnosing pneumonia. With the HPN Application Cartridge, the Company aims to detect the vast majority of pneumonia-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance markers in hospitalized patients.



The HPN Application Cartridge of microorganisms and resistance gene markers was designed based on feedback of clinical experts and international and national guidelines. It aims to detect at least 90% of healthcare-associated pneumonia-causing pathogens and clinically relevant resistances against antimicrobials. The Application Cartridge is primarily designed to capture patients at risks for:




● | microorganisms causing severe, and complicated to treat, forms of pneumonia, e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | microorganisms carrying antibiotic resistance and where patients may need isolation (MRSA, Klebsiella);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria that might not be targeted by empiric treatment schemes; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | rare and difficult to detect pathogens like Legionella sp.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------




The Application Cartridge composition takes pathogen incidences into account. It includes those microorganisms showing an incidence of above 1%. The Application Cartridge is completed by adding pathogens with lower incidence but a high clinical need, such as Legionella sp.

The HPN Application Cartridge covers 17 antibiotic resistance markers, including: (i) ß-Lactam resistance, including ESBL; (ii) kpc resistance; (iii) macrolide resistance; (iv) quinolone resistance; and (v) multi-drug resistance.



The LRT Application Cartridge was launched in the United States in April 2018. It is an FDA-cleared Application Cartridge for the fully automated detection of 20 pathogens covering 35 species and 10 antibiotic resistance markers, for lower respiratory tract infections with a total of 29 PCR assays combined in eight multiplexed PCR reactions. Although similar in most respects to the HPN Application Cartridge, the LRT differs from the HPN in its pathogen reporting due to FDA reporting requirements. In accordance with a De Novo request that was granted by the FDA in April 2018, the label claim covers the use of LRT with tracheal aspirate samples only and has cleared 19 pathogen assays as well as 10 antibiotic resistance marker assays.



The LRT BAL Application Cartridge that was 510(k)-cleared by the FDA in December 2019 and launched in the United States in January 2020, is a version of the LRT Application Cartridge that is optimized for use with commonly obtained BAL specimens. The Unyvero LRT BAL application is the first and only FDA-cleared molecular diagnostic panel that detects Pneumocystis jirovecii in addition to a broad spectrum of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance markers associated with pneumonia.



The ITI Application Cartridge 



The ITI Application Cartridge was launched in May 2016 and is the second-generation version of the ITI Application Cartridge originally launched in the second quarter of 2014. Improvements were made to the panel and analytical performance as well as clinical sensitivity and specificity. It is a CE-IVD-marked Application Cartridge for the fully automated detection of currently 29 pathogens covering more than 86 species and 17 antibiotic resistance markers for eight different clinical indications within the areas of prosthetic joint infections, surgical site infections, diabetic foot ulcers, catheter-associated infections, deep skin and tissue infections, cardiology-related infections, burn wounds and other implant infections. CE performance evaluation has demonstrated sensitivity of 86.9% at specificity of 99.2%. A diverse range of sample types such as aspirates and exudates, pus, sonication fluid, swabs, synovial fluid and tissue can be used on this Application Cartridge. Moreover, biofilm-forming pathogens, which are very difficult to break-up and culture by traditional methods, can be identified by the Unyvero A50 Platform. The ITI Application Cartridge was jointly developed and co-funded with a worldwide market leader in orthopedic bone cement, which offers comprehensive infection management solutions. The Company pays a customer referral commission but has retained full control on product commercialization.
The BCU Application Cartridge 



The BCU Application Cartridge was launched in Europe in April 2016. It is a CE-IVD-marked and Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA)-cleared Application Cartridge for the fully automated detection of 34 pathogens covering more than 73 species and 16 antibiotic resistance markers relevant in the area of blood stream infections. The CE-IVD performance evaluation has demonstrated a weighted average sensitivity for all pathogens of 96.2%, and a weighted average specificity of 99.4%. Unlike other Unyvero Application Cartridges, BCU uses samples from positive blood cultures rather than native patient samples. Such blood cultures are started in cases of suspected blood stream infections.
The IAI Application Cartridge



The IAI Application Cartridge was launched in April 2017. It is a CE-IVD-marked Application Cartridge for the fully automated detection of 26 pathogens covering more than 82 species, two toxins and 22 resistance markers for several different clinical indications within the areas of severe intra-abdominal infections such as symptoms of peritonitis, appendicitis, acute abdomen, acute pancreatitis, and megacolon. Overall weighted average sensitivity for the pathogens specifically targeted by the test panel was 93.8% at an overall weighted average specificity of 99.7% following discrepant result resolution.
The UTI Application Cartridge



The UTI Application Cartridge was launched in April 2018. It is a CE-IVD-marked Application Cartridge for the fully automated detection of up to 25 pathogens covering more than 86 species and 15 genetic resistance markers for the areas of severe urinary tract infections in patients with anatomical, structural and functional alterations, renal impairments, impaired immune status, catheter-associated UTI, patients failing to respond to therapy and suffering from severe manifestations, urosepsis. OpGen estimates that the addressable market for the UTI Application Cartridge is 1.6 million cases eligible for testing per year in the EU and the United States. The UTI Application Cartridge is also available as a RUO product in the United States since 2020. As part of our portfolio strategy update in the fourth quarter of 2020, we decided to proceed with the analytical and clinical performance evaluation including clinical trials required for a subsequent submission to the FDA for this Application Cartridge and initiated clinical trials in the third quarter of 2021. We completed enrollment of over 1,800 patient samples into a prospective multi-center clinical trial during 2022. Following the announcement of preliminary top line data in December 2022, we currently expect to conclude reference testing in early 2023 and expect a subsequent submission to the FDA.

Curetis’ SARS-CoV-2 Kit



CE IVD-marked in 2020, Curetis has developed and commercializes a PCR based rapid test kit for SARS-CoV-2 detection. It uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology for qualitative detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus isolated from oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider or for screening of asymptomatic individuals. This kit can be used with RNA isolated by performing standard RNA isolation processes, as well as with oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs collected in PCR compatible viral transport medium treated with PCR-Compatible Universal Lysis Buffer (PULB) provided in the kit. In year four of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has transitioned out of the emergency phase, and we no longer expect revenues from the Company’s SARS-CoV-2 kit.
Ares Genetics’ NGS and Bioinformatics Services for Molecular Microbiology 



OpGen’s other core business in NGS and bioinformatics based solutions for molecular microbiology is operated by its wholly owned subsidiary Ares Genetics GmbH, or Ares Genetics, or Ares, founded in 2017 and based in Vienna, Austria. Ares Genetics’ business is based on the proprietary ARES Technology Platform and Ares Genetics’ proprietary genetic database on AMR, ARESdb. The ARES Technology Platform and ARESdb build and expand upon the GEAR assets acquired from Siemens Technology Accelerator GmbH in 2016. On the bioinformatics side, OpGen has integrated data from its now discontinued Acuitas Lighthouse into the Ares Genetics (Ares) ARESdb. Ares Genetics believes ARESdb is a unique comprehensive database on the genetics of antibiotic resistance currently including data from over 130,000 sequenced isolates and phenotypic data on over 100 antibiotics. Ares Genetics also pursues an active out-licensing and collaboration strategy with suitable partners in the life science, pharmaceutical, and diagnostic industry to jointly develop solutions for microbiology relying on the database and/or the Ares Technology Platform. Ares Genetics entered into its first partnering and strategic collaborations with Qiagen, Sandoz, and in 2021 entered into strategic data access deal with one of the world’s leading microbiology and IVD corporations which obtained non-exclusive access to approximately 1.1% of Ares Genetics’ then-current datasets.



In addition to its out-licensing strategy, Ares Genetics offers next-generation molecular AMR testing services out of its NGS service labs, which moved into a new facility in Vienna, Austria, in January 2023 with initial focus on infection control, AMR epidemiology and surveillance, clinical research and pharmaceutical anti-infectives research and development.



Ares Genetics has also developed its ARESasp Universal Pathogenome Assay, which is based on the ARES Technology Platform and ARESdb. ARESasp is intended to cover nearly any pathogen in a broad array of sample types and to predict antimicrobial drug response to a wide variety of treatment options using a single NGS laboratory workflow.



In August 2019, Ares Genetics opened a specialized service laboratory offering next-generation AMR testing services with an initial focus on infection control, AMR epidemiology and surveillance, clinical research and pharmaceutical anti-infectives research and development. All services are based on NGS and Ares Genetics’ proprietary, AI-powered AMR database ARESdb and the ARES Technology Platform for data interpretation. OpGen also began offering Ares Genetics’ services in the United States from its Rockville, Maryland-based lab in the fourth quarter of 2022.



In 2022, Ares Genetics launched AREScloud, a software as a service offering. The commercially available web application is intended for research use only and aims at professionals in clinical microbiology, public health, and microbial R&D. AREScloud intends to automate the accurate analysis and comprehensive interpretation of microbial genome data for surveillance and infection prevention and control applications. The web application leverages the contents of the proprietary ARESdb to enable the AI-assisted antibiogram prediction (referred to as predictive AST) directly from bacterial genome data.



Acuitas AMR Gene Panel



We believe more rapid genetic identification methods will reduce morbidity from MDROs, reduce healthcare costs through reduced length of stay, and assist in the identification of targeted antibiotic therapy. Current conventional microbiology, largely unchanged in 50 years, requires one to two days for growth and phenotypic analysis and often leads to the use of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy in the early stages of infection.



OpGen has developed the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel, which was 510(k)-cleared by the FDA in September 2021 for testing bacterial isolates. This test had already been made available in the United States prior to FDA-clearance as an RUO test, and had been used in such capacity in connection with The New York State Infectious Disease Digital Health Initiative for testing of bacterial isolates.








13
--



The Acuitas AMR Gene Panel is FDA cleared to detect a comprehensive panel of 28 genetic AMR markers, covering select drugs in 9 classes of antibiotics, in isolated bacterial colonies from 26 different pathogens. An identified bacterial isolate is tested, and the antibiotic resistance gene markers associated with the selected bacterial species are reported as “Detected”, “Not Detected” or “NA/NR”.



Market Overview



Antimicrobial Resistance – An Urgent Global Issue



AMR is one of the greatest global public health threats that has been recognized by many international bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A recent publication in The Lancet (January 19, 2022) confirms the rapid spread of AMR infections and highlights that, an estimated 4.95 million deaths worldwide were associated with AMR in 2019, and between 2014 and 2019, the burden of fatalities directly attributable to bacterial AMR rose from 700 thousand to 1.27 million. The growing threat of AMR to public health is exacerbated by existing and newly developed antibiotics facing a wide range of drug resistance mechanisms in pathogens of concern. Recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) treatment guidance for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections (Clin Infect Dis 2021 Apr 8;72(7):e169-e183) highlights how detection of AMR genes or a specific mechanism of resistance can help guide reporting practices for novel antimicrobial agents and tailor therapy for these difficult to treat infections. Furthermore, detection of AMR can help bring infection prevention and control initiatives such as patient isolation procedures into use when multiple isolates with the same AMR profile are detected as an early indication of transmission within a facility or for surveillance of serious or emerging AMR threats.



Antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable but often avoidable costs to the U.S. healthcare system. In most cases, these infections require longer and/or costlier treatments, extended hospital stays, additional doctor visits and healthcare facilities use, and result in greater disability and death compared with infections that are treatable with currently available antibiotics. Estimates for the total economic cost to the U.S. economy are difficult to calculate but have been estimated to be as high as $20 billion in excess direct healthcare costs annually.



Over the last decade, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, frequently referred to as superbugs, have been implicated in severe healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), and their occurrence has increased steadily. For example, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is responsible for roughly 15% of Gram-negative infections in hospital intensive care units. Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, or KPC, strains have few treatment options and are associated with a mortality rate upwards of 50%.



Exacerbating the problems associated with the emergence of these highly resistant KPC strains is their propensity to cause outbreaks in healthcare institutions. These pathogens persist both in the flora of hospitalized patients and in the hospital environment, and they have the capacity to silently colonize patients or hospital personnel by establishing residence in the gastrointestinal tract without causing any signs of infection. Individuals can be silently colonized or become asymptomatic carriers for long periods of time, with detection of these carriers often proving difficult. These silent carriers act as reservoirs for continued transmission, which makes subsequent spread difficult to control and outbreaks difficult to stop. In addition, KPC strains can survive for several hours on the hands of hospital personnel, which likely facilitates the spread of organisms from patient to patient. Effective control of KPC outbreaks requires a detailed understanding of how transmission occurs, but current technologies do not allow healthcare providers to routinely perform these investigations on a timely basis.



The lack of currently available treatment options and scarcity of new treatment options in development are compounding the emerging superbug problem. It has been close to 30 years since a new class of antibiotics was developed and successfully introduced. As a result, we believe that rapid, accurate identification of the relevant pathogen and its genetic make-up, screening, infection control and antibiotic stewardship have become one of the most powerful weapons in the fight to contain this threat.



The emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens has made the treatment of patients with UTIs a growing problem in the United States and internationally. There are approximately 10 million patients each year in the United States with UTIs and more than one million of these patients have complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) often requiring hospitalization with intravenous antibiotic therapy. Among these patients E. coli represents the most common pathogen, and recent data indicate that 18.3% of U.S. E. coli isolates are extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) resistant. These patients present complicated therapeutic choices for clinicians and often require last resort carbapenem antibiotics. The rate of ESBL resistant E. coli increased 34% annually between 2010 and 2014. Therapy with carbapenem antibiotics has contributed to growing carbapenem-resistance (CRE) rates and high patient treatment costs.

Based on industry analyses, we believe the global healthcare-associated infections market is a $2 billion dollar market with the molecular diagnostic segment representing a fast-growing segment of such market with multiple high acuity patients and significant types of infections, including UTIs, surgical site infections, pneumonia and bloodstream infections.



Competition



We are developing a molecular diagnostics (MDx) business focused on leading a transformation in microbiology and infectious disease through precision medicine products and services that combine genomic data and bioinformatics. Our approach combines proprietary platforms and content, namely the FDA cleared and CE-IVD-marked Unyvero A50 System and its DNA-based Unyvero Panels, the FDA-cleared Acuitas AMR Gene Panel, and NGS applications based on leading AI-powered AMR knowledge-bases. Our competitors include rapid diagnostic testing, NGS testing, and traditional microbiology companies, commercial laboratories, information technology companies, and hospital laboratories who may internally develop testing capabilities. Principal competitive factors in our target market include: organizational size, scale, and breadth of product offerings; rapidity of test results; quality and strength of clinical and analytical validation data and confidence in diagnostic results; cost effectiveness; ease of use; and regulatory approval status.



Our principal competition comes from traditional methods used by healthcare providers to diagnose and screen for MDROs and from other molecular diagnostic companies creating screening and diagnostic products such as Cepheid (a subsidiary of Danaher), Becton-Dickinson (BD), bioMérieux, Accelerate Diagnostics, T2 Biosystems, GenMark (a subsidiary of Roche), Qiagen, Luminex (acquired by DiaSorin), Thermo Fisher and Mobidiag (a subsidiary of Hologic). We believe our focus on identifying antibiotic-resistant genes in addition to broad panels of organisms from a wide variety of native clinical sample types, and our Ares Genetics bioinformatics offerings differentiate us from such competitors.



Competitors may develop their own versions of our product offerings in countries where we do not have patents or where our intellectual property rights are not recognized.



Many of our potential competitors have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, research and development and selling and marketing capabilities than we do. Others may develop products with prices lower than ours that could be viewed by hospitals, physicians and payers as functionally equivalent to our products and services, or offer products and services at prices designed to promote market penetration, which could force us to lower our list prices and affect our ability to achieve profitability. If we are unable to change clinical practice in a meaningful way or compete successfully against current and future competitors, we may be unable to increase market acceptance and sales of our products, which could prevent us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability and could cause our stock price to decline.



Competition to the Unyvero System 



The Unyvero A50 Platform is a sample-to-answer MDx solution. There are several other companies who develop and commercialize similar systems. In terms of devices and assays, OpGen believes its key competitors include bioMérieux (BioFire with its FilmArray® platform), GenMark (a subsidiary of Roche) with its ePlex® platform, and Accelerate Diagnostics with its Pheno™. Taking into consideration the broader market, devices of other key competitors can be extended to include Cepheid (GeneXpert®), T2 Biosystems (T2DX®), Luminex Corporation (formerly known as Nanosphere; now acquired by DiaSorin) (Verigene System® and Aries®), Becton-Dickinson (BD Max™), Binx Health (with io™ System), Roche (Cobas® Liat® and GeneWEAVE), Qiagen (QIAstat-Dx™) and Biocartis N.V (Idylla™), Bosch (Vivalytic platform), SpeeDx (Plex/Resistance), and the Meridian Bioscience (formerly GenePOC) Revogene® system. The competition to the Company’s Application Cartridges for a specific indication, including companies providing reagent kits only (e.g. Seegene, Fast-Track Diagnostics/Siemens Healthineers, Genetic Signatures) and developers of laboratory developed tests (LDT) have to be assessed indication by indication. OpGen believes that its Unyvero A50 Platform has certain key characteristics that clearly differentiate it from other sample-to-answer systems.



Based on its corporate market analysis, OpGen believes that due to the proprietary lysis technology its Unyvero A50 Platform is able to process a broader variety of sample types than competing platforms. In most cases, no labor or time intensive manual sample preparation (other than 30 minutes of automated sample preparation) is necessary and even difficult and blood-contaminated native samples can be processed. Furthermore, the Unyvero A50 Platform is CE-IVD-marked for a variety of samples including sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirate, exudate, catheter tip, pus, sonication fluid, synovial fluid, swab and tissue. Further samples such as blood, urine, stool and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues present further options for extending the variety of samples for future applications. Fresh or frozen samples as well as samples that have been stored in different media can be processed easily on the Unyvero A50 Platform. As the lysis is integrated into the workflow, hands-on time and potential handling errors are significantly reduced.

--



The Unyvero A50 Platform is also differentiated from competing products by its end-point PCR base high multiplexing capabilities, which allows for the execution of eight independent multiplex PCR reactions simultaneously. Therefore, Unyvero can identify a broad range of microorganisms and a large variety of antibiotic resistance markers in a single run.



We believe the Unyvero platform is highly differentiated in the market by focusing on severe infectious diseases and having developed an HPN Application Cartridge, an ITI Application Cartridge, a BCU Application Cartridge, an IAI Application Cartridge and a UTI Application Cartridge and planning to develop further Application Cartridges (e.g. on the Unyvero A30 RQ platform) in other severe infectious disease indications.



Although several direct competitors have in the past several years started to develop or commercialize their own infectious disease tests, OpGen believes that the variety and breadth of its menu of cartridges targeting different infectious diseases positions it favorably to answer patient and customer needs.



Competition to the Unyvero Application Cartridges 



Considering its panel design, the Company believes that there are currently few assays directly comparable to the Company’s HPN, LRT, LRT BAL, ITI, IAI, and UTI Unyvero Application Cartridges that are commercially available to date. Various competitors offer testing in some, but not all, of the infections targeted by Unyvero Application Cartridges. For example, for the HPN and LRT Application Cartridges, currently only two companies (OpGen and bioMérieux/BioFire) offer an FDA-cleared IVD automated molecular panel for lower respiratory tract infections and pneumonia. According to publicly available sources, Accelerate Diagnostics has a CE-IVD pneumonia assay and it is believed to be planned for future submission to the FDA for clearance. Other companies, such as, Luminex (formerly Nanosphere; now DiaSorin), GenMark (a subsidiary of Roche), Seegene, Genomica, Miacom, PathoFinder, Fast-Track Diagnostics (now a Siemens Healthineers company), Randox, ArcDia, Qiagen, and iCubate are primarily targeting the upper respiratory tract with their panels. Their panels mainly cover viruses and a few bacteria, and in certain instances, a limited number of antibiotic resistance markers only. Diatherix offers a manual test claiming to cover both upper and lower respiratory infections. OpGen believes that it offers the most comprehensive panel for severe bacterial pneumonia for critically ill patients that require hospitalization, as the panel includes unique and differentiated bacterial targets and the broadest coverage of carbapenem resistance markers, while BioFire’s panel has a limited range of resistance markers and viral targets.
Competition by Conventional Microbiology



The conventional microbiology market consists of culture and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight mass spectrometry, or MALDI-TOF, based testing and is largely shared by well-established players including BD, bioMérieux, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Danaher (Cepheid, Beckman Coulter), and Thermo Fisher Scientific. Culture-based testing is usually performed in the central laboratory at turnaround times of 48 to 72 hours and it is yet to be seen whether it can robustly be accelerated by miniaturization, an approach pursued by the company Accelerate Diagnostics and other companies developing rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing, or AST, methods (Pattern Bioscience, Q-Linea ASTar, Lifescale, Specific Diagnostics Reveal, Gradientech, oCelloScope), as well as efforts to achieve AST with MALDI-TOF. While turnaround times for MALDI-TOF based testing is much faster, overall turnaround times from sample to report are still greater than 24 hours as MALDI-TOF generally depends on an initial culturing step for pathogen isolation and cannot be performed from native patient samples. Generally, providers of conventional microbiology solutions are focusing on reducing turnaround time, use of labor and lab space, as well as overall costs by automatic specimen processing and pathogen identification.



Competition by Molecular Diagnostics – PCR



Key players in the PCR-based molecular diagnostics market include bioMérieux, BD, Danaher, Roche, Qiagen, Abbott, Hologic, OpGen (including Curetis GmbH), amongst others. PCR-based microbiology testing is usually performed at the point of need or in the central laboratory at rapidly reduced turnaround time compared to conventional microbiology. Generally, providers of PCR-based molecular diagnostics are focusing on further reducing turnaround time to less than 30 minutes to one hour and/or increasing multi-plexing degree as well as reducing use of labor, lab space, and overall costs. The Company believes that its ability to quantitatively predict antibiotic susceptibility based on the pathogen’s genetic profile complements PCR-based approaches detecting panels of genes and mutations as indicators of resistance.



Competition to Ares Genetics 



Ares Genetics’ peers and competitors include companies providing conventional microbiology, PCR- and NGS-based molecular diagnostics, as well as AMR databases and bioinformatics solutions. In general, many peers and competitors are at the same time also considered potential ARESdb licensing partners due to the unique content and positioning of ARES’ artificial intelligence curated reference database.

16
--



Competition by Molecular Diagnostics – NGS



The emerging NGS-based molecular diagnostics market is shared by start-up-like companies such as IDbyDNA (acquired by Illumina), Karius, CosmosID, Noscendo, Day Zero Diagnostics, or ArcBio aiming at disrupting the molecular microbiology by pathogen detection via direct sequencing from patient samples, as well as established players such as bioMérieux focusing on isolate sequencing to monitor outbreaks in hospitals (in partnership with Illumina). NGS-based testing is currently performed as a service and companies mostly focus on reducing turnaround time as well as increasing the NGS market share in molecular microbiology. NGS-based molecular diagnostics companies are considered Ares Genetics’ closest competitors, while Ares Genetics believes it has a competitive advantage arising from its ability to predict antibiotic susceptibility based on the pathogen’s genetic profile with reliable performance meeting FDA requirements for functional testing of AST by culture.



Competing AMR Databases & Bioinformatics Solutions



To date, several AMR databases exist (e.g. CARD, PATRIC, etc.) but they are purely designed for academic research applications as they neither represent IVD-grade reference databases, nor systematically cover high-resolution resistance profiles including confidence levels and diagnostic performance parameters for associated AMR markers. The commercial microbial bioinformatics solution market on the other hand, is largely covered by Qiagen, a strategic licensing partner of Ares Genetics for co-marketing bioinformatics research solutions based on ARESdb.
Research and Development



OpGen intends to continue to invest in the development of additional Unyvero panels such as UTI for the Unyvero A50 platform, a Unyvero IJI panel for the Unyvero A30 RQ platform, as well as the Ares Genetics bioinformatics solutions.



Our ongoing and anticipated research and development efforts include:



● | Expanding the Ares Genetics bioinformatics and NGS offerings such as ARESdb, AREScloud, ARESiss, ARESid, ARESasp, etc.;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Development of the Unyvero A30 RQ platform including an IJI cartridge as well as the AMR panel from blood culture bottles under our research and development collaboration with FIND;

● | Compilation of a De Novo request package for Unyvero UTI with subsequent submission to U.S. FDA. Based on prior experience and guidance, and subject to successfully passing the initial acceptance review, the FDA would then begin its substantive review of the request, which may include various types of communication, including an interactive review of our submission; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical trials and regulatory filings for Unyvero IJI in the United States (expected as De Novo with clinical trial at a minimum of three trial sites and minimum of 1,500 samples tested, subject to funding).

Sales and Marketing



OpGen currently sells and markets its products and services directly in the United States through a dedicated sales and marketing support team. Internationally, we sell our products through 13 distributors covering 32 countries.



We operate in one segment. Our operations are located in the United States, Germany, and Austria.



Our strategy to build demand for our products following receipt of applicable regulatory clearances includes completing clinical verification studies, customer driven evaluations and studies, and sales of our tests for RUO.



Customers 



OpGen’s commercial teams have identified several stakeholder groups: treating clinicians, doctors of pharmacy (PharmDs), antibiotic stewardship programs, microbiologists, molecular biologists and laboratory managers as well as hospital administration, all of whom will be actively involved in the purchase decision at varying levels and stages. In terms of product benefits, OpGen believes that clinicians and physicians seek timely diagnostic results that can be used to better inform or confirm a treatment decision and improve patient outcomes, while microbiology laboratory managers, who have to contend with the steadily decreasing availability of trained lab technicians and the need to perform testing during off-shifts, need simple-to-use, robust technologies. Ultimately, however, the decision whether a proposed new testing solution is cost effective and affordable on a routine basis must be made by the payer, which in the case of hospitalized in-patients under the diagnosis-related groups, or DRG, reimbursement system is typically the hospitals’ purchasing and finance departments. OpGen’s key account management ensures that all stakeholders are targeted early in the sales process.

Sales Process



The typical sales process starts with an introductory visit to the microbiology laboratory director and senior microbiology staff. During such introductory visits, we introduce Unyvero and/or Acuitas to the customer, assess general interest in evaluating the products during a demonstration phase, and aim to initiate contact with any new hospital customer via the gatekeeping microbiology laboratory function. The primary objective of these visits, in addition to locking in a demonstration phase of our products for the customer, is to seek joint introductory meetings with the senior microbiology staff and the various intensive care units, or ICUs, and clinicians in any relevant ICU as well as the relevant member(s) of the antimicrobial stewardship team. Since there can be multiple ICUs (sometimes over a dozen in major university hospitals) with multiple rotating shifts operating on a twenty-four hour a day, seven day a week basis, it is paramount to identify one or a few key ICUs as internal product champions. The clinicians are ultimately the end-customers of our Application Cartridge/Panel results for use in treatment assessment and optimizing medical care for their patients. They are also the personnel responsible for routinely requesting a test be conducted.



At this stage, sales personnel typically discuss the ideal placement of the Unyvero System for a demonstration phase with the customer. In the United States, the Unyvero System is placed in the core laboratory. In the EU and the rest of world, or RoW, central location in the microbiology laboratory is the preferred option, or alternatively placed near the patient ICU. We believe it is also important to engage the clinical pharmacy community, and specifically infectious disease pharmacists, in the sales process as an additional key stakeholder and decision maker.



OpGen expects that the entire sales process, from the introductory visit to the point in time when the hospital begins routinely purchasing Application Cartridges or Acuitas consumables, known as the push-pull triangle model, which includes the lab, the clinicians and the finance entity, will take around six to twelve months or longer, based on the experience of competitors and peer companies, in the United States and about the same time from start to finish in the EU. Depending on the time of year and budget cycle, however, a contractual arrangement can take significantly longer. An integral part of the sales process is the placement of demo systems without payment for demo evaluation purpose.



OpGen’s marketing provides sales and sales support tools adapted to the specifics of each stakeholder and stimulates demand by setting up awareness campaigns for lab personnel, clinicians and general hospital stakeholders. In the more developed markets of the EU and the RoW, additional customer segmentation reflects the business opportunity per customer or institution and is linked to size of the hospital reflected in the number of beds available at the institution. Therefore, the sales strategy is based on a key account management approach, initially only targeting large hospitals with clear focus on departments like pulmonology/pneumology, large ICUs or orthopedics wards depending on the particular Application Cartridge of interest.



The focus is on high-volume consumable orders (Application Cartridges, Acuitas AMR Gene Panel kits and other consumables) instead of driving revenues and profits through hardware placements (Unyvero System or EZ1/QS5 installations). Consequently, OpGen and its distribution partners aim to optimize the utilization of each placed hardware unit rather than solely maximizing the installed base of instruments. Therefore, OpGen, with its tests primarily targeting in-patients (hospitalized) with severe infections, is focusing its sales and commercialization efforts on laboratories in hospitals and independent laboratories serving larger hospitals.



OpGen and its distribution partners will also face certain market entry barriers mostly related to upfront investments for the implementation of its new technology, as most laboratories and microbiology centers are cost centers, which do not directly benefit from the current DRG reimbursement scheme. Additionally, the Unyvero and Acuitas Platforms will be an add-on test not replacing traditional testing – in this case cultures, which are perceived as comparatively cheap. Therefore, OpGen pursues a sales strategy whereby it offers customers a number of different financial options for its products and services, including rental agreements (pursuant to which OpGen would provide the instruments on the basis that the customer commits to buying a certain number of Application Cartridges or other consumables from OpGen over a set period of time, with the cost of such Application Cartridges or Acuitas consumables incorporating a reagent rental charge for the use of the instrumentation), or a straight cash purchase of the Unyvero or Acuitas Platforms, as applicable. Similar concepts are employed by OpGen’s distribution partners at their discretion.



As OpGen is marketing its innovative Unyvero and Acuitas Platforms to a diverse and demanding customer base, implementing solutions that offers the potential to improve upon the current standard of care, the Company’s management believes it will need to continue making additional investments in clinical validation, scientific publications, brand awareness and market education worldwide, but with a focus in the EU and United States. Some of the Company’s tests will require market access activities to prove their value and to obtain sufficient reimbursement by relevant payers for certain countries.

OpGen has developed a full suite of marketing communications tools using print and online channels. OpGen also supplies supporting evidence for the various individual stakeholders, for instance approaching microbiologists and clinicians with first-in-class scientific marketing. This not only includes the classical marketing mix (i.e. a set of marketing tools regarding product, price, place and promotion), but also compiles information on health economics and clinical outcomes research.



In addition, OpGen’s marketing focuses on medical education of physicians through its scientific affairs team, participation in scientific conferences, organizing scientific sessions and symposia, and by publications in peer-reviewed journals.



Distribution Channels 



To distribute the Unyvero A50 System and the Application Cartridges, OpGen has adopted a dual approach combining direct sales in the United States with indirect sales through specialized distributors in several countries of Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America (see section “Indirect Sales Markets” for a detailed list).



As of December 31, 2022, OpGen had an installed base of approximately 200 Unyvero A50 Analyzers across global markets.



The choice between direct sales and indirect sales distribution is based on available funding for OpGen’s commercial operations, the attractiveness of the market in terms of size, pricing, and reimbursement, the ease of market access in terms of regulations, structure and complexity of the healthcare system, and payer situation. Markets are also selected based on the availability of suitable distributors with appropriate size, portfolio, sales channels, experience, networks, and reputation to introduce an innovative product like Unyvero in their respective market. It is also not uncommon for MDx companies to start with a distributor model before going direct once economics permit establishing a direct sales infrastructure.



OpGen regularly evaluates, on a case-by-case basis, whether the chosen distribution channel is adequate to also cater for the new target disease segments, or whether a new structure should be put in place.



Direct Sales U.S. Market



OpGen currently markets and sells the Unyvero and Acuitas Platforms and will market any future cleared Application Cartridges and other consumables directly in the United States through its own U.S.-based commercial organization including sales, marketing and after-sales support.



As of December 31, 2022, OpGen had an installed base of approximately 35 Unyvero A50 Analyzers across the United States and in different types of hospitals and laboratories, including installations for clinical studies.



Indirect Sales Markets

 OpGen enters into a standard distribution agreement with most of its Unyvero distributors, which specifies the particular Unyvero products and the respective distribution territory. The distribution agreements typically contain provisions for exclusive distribution within a particular territory and the specified term, typically from three to five-years. During that period, the distributor has exclusive rights to market, sell and distribute all specified Unyvero products. In return, each distributor needs to commit to annual minimum purchases of Unyvero Systems, including components, as well as Application Cartridges. Transfer prices for the Unyvero Systems and Application Cartridges are defined and reflect typical MDx industry distributor margins on consumable sales. If a distributor fails to meet its annual minimum commitments fixed in the contract, the Company has the right to either terminate such agreement in its entirety, or to terminate the exclusivity of the distributor’s territory. Such distribution agreements can be extended by mutual agreement between the parties. Furthermore, the agreements also contain typical change of control provisions relating to a merger or consolidation of the company, the sale of its assets or the liquidation of the company.



OpGen, through its subsidiary Curetis, has entered into distribution agreements with 13 distributors covering 32 countries. The Company has distribution agreements in place for the following European countries:




● | A. Menarini Diagnostics S.r.l.: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom;

The total contractual minimum purchase requirements of all current distributors are 372 Unyvero A50 Systems of which about 350 are part of BCB’s commitment, which applies over an eight-year period following market approval in China by the National Medical Products Association (NMPA), plus approximately 1.5 million Application Cartridges which are also part of BCB’s commitment during the same period. The above minimum purchase requirements do not guarantee any certain minimum future levels of revenues.



With respect to after-sales support and maintenance, OpGen in some markets has established a concept of system replacement instead of onsite repair. In the event of system failure or required maintenance, systems in such markets are rapidly replaced (within one or a few days), minimizing downtime for the customer as well as reducing the need for a costly service organization. In certain instances, OpGen uses its own small field service engineering team to provide ad hoc on-site repair and service. OpGen, via its Curetis subsidiary, has also trained field service engineers of several of our distribution partners so that they can perform certain repairs and services themselves. OpGen expects to establish a service maintenance arrangement where customers and distributors pay for support and repair based on what service package they have purchased.




Manufacturing



During 2022, we manufactured all our Unyvero products in Germany (Unyvero systems are manufactured by our German supplier Zollner Elektronik AG, or Zollner, and Unyvero cartridges and consumables are manufactured at our own facility in Bodelshausen, Germany), and all our FDA-cleared Acuitas AMR products were produced at our new headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. As of year-end, the Acuitas AMR product manufacturing was in the process of being transferred to Curetis in Germany, and the transfer was successfully completed in early 2023.



Manufacturing of our CE-IVD-marked and FDA-cleared products is performed under the respective applicable relevant current standards – Quality System Regulation (QSR) as required by the FDA or other relevant regulatory bodies for the manufacture of IVD labeled products. These regulations carefully control the manufacture, testing and release of IVD products as well as raw material receipt and control. We also have ongoing post market surveillance and vigilance responsibilities under applicable European and FDA regulations, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA or other relevant regulatory bodies to determine compliance with the FDA’s or other applicable requirements, including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA’s Form 483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement.

For instrument manufacturing, OpGen’s subsidiary Curetis decided to co-develop and subsequently outsource all of its Unyvero A50 instrument manufacturing to Zollner. With regard to Application Cartridges, they are developed and manufactured entirely in-house, using equipment provided by Contexo GmbH and certain components provided by Horst Scholz GmbH, or Scholz. Curetis has established a sophisticated manufacturing site for its cartridges where it has full control over the entire production process ensuring that Application Cartridges meet stringent quality requirements.



Curetis’ EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services) provider Zollner is an established and experienced medical device manufacturer for large global companies and has flexible production processes ensuring it can meet demands with different volume requests. The Company’s management believes that manufacturing capacity will not become a bottleneck in the foreseeable future as inventory levels are sufficient to support anticipated demand for the coming years. Zollner also has all required certifications under all applicable ISO standards for IVD instrument manufacture and is an FDA registered establishment for the manufacturing of the Unyvero A50 instruments. To date, no decision has been made on the selection of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the series production of the Unyvero A30 RQ systems. Unyvero A30 RQ systems are so far being produced in pilot batches by DMT Produktentwicklung GmbH as the current German development partner to Curetis.



As part of its operational strategy, OpGen’s subsidiary Curetis decided to build and operate its own manufacturing facility inside premises leased to it for the manufacturing of the Application Cartridges. The Application Cartridge manufacturing facility based in Bodelshausen, Germany, has been operational since 2011. Curetis is able to manufacture sufficient product to meet current and forecasted demand. OpGen expects future Application Cartridges to be used with the Unyvero A30 RQ Analyzer for its own research and development purposes and other future products such as the Acuitas IVD products and/or potential products for the Unyvero A30 RQ will also be manufactured in Bodelshausen, in a dedicated manufacturing line module using plastic parts manufactured by Scholz.



The Curetis facilities at Holzgerlingen, Germany, as well as manufacturing facility in Bodelshausen, Germany were subject to an FDA inspection in February 2019, which was successfully completed with no FDA Form 483 observations.



Zollner 



On May 27, 2009, OpGen’s subsidiary Curetis and Zollner Elektronik AG, Zandt, Germany, or Zollner, entered into a framework agreement, pursuant to which Zollner performs certain development and manufacturing services for the Unyvero System. Under the terms of the agreement, each party retains rights to its respective intellectual property. The agreement specifies that manufacturing intellectual property created jointly or solely by Zollner while performing work and services for Curetis shall be solely with Zollner. For any manufacturing intellectual property owned by Zollner, Curetis receives a non-exclusive, non-transferable, world-wide, royalty free, irrevocable perpetual license (without a right to sublicense) to use, provided that such manufacturing intellectual property is embodied in a product provided to Curetis. As of today, there is no such manufacturing intellectual property. The agreement is for an indefinite period of term and may be terminated with 12 months’ prior written notice.



The framework agreement has been expanded by a development agreement in 2010 and related project agreements for various development projects as well as by a strategic supply agreement signed in June 2013 under which Zollner became the OEM contract manufacturer for all Unyvero A50 instruments for Curetis.



Scholz



On February 1, 2013, Curetis and Horst Scholz GmbH & Co. KG, Kronach, Germany, or Scholz, entered into a framework agreement, pursuant to which Scholz is requested to perform certain services in the area of tool development and tool making (injection molding tools to make plastic parts) and manufacturing product components (i.e., all plastic parts for the Application Cartridges) for Curetis. The parts for the Unyvero A50 products include, among other things, the base plates, valve plate, PCR chamber parts, spin column holder, waste chamber, reagent container, plungers and housing body parts. All rights, title, interest and ownership in the injection molding tools and plastic products specified in this agreement, including the respective intellectual property rights shall be transferred and assigned to and solely belong to Curetis. Under this agreement, Scholz guarantees that all such rights solely belong to Curetis. The framework agreement constitutes the legal basis for all legal relations between the parties after February 2013, in particular for the supply agreement.



In addition to volume production with these pre-existing molds, Curetis subsequently commissioned a series of multi-cavity injection molds (owned by Curetis yet stored and used on site at Scholz) under a strategic lease agreement with Scholz for all injection molded plastics parts entered into on July 28, 2015. The agreement is for an indefinite period of term and may be terminated with 12 months prior written notice or may be terminated earlier by Curetis once the last order for related plastic parts has been fulfilled.
 

Under the framework agreement with Scholz, Curetis in 2018 also commissioned several single- and multi-cavity injection models for parts of the Unyvero A30 RQ cartridge. These injection molds were developed, manufactured and put into service by Scholz over the course of 2018 and 2019 under the same terms as described above for the injection molds for the Unyvero A50 cartridges.

Supply Agreements



Curetis is party to a supply agreement with a large single-source supplier for purchase of PCR Master Mix reagent and other product components, which are used as integral parts of Curetis’ Application Cartridges. Pursuant to the agreement, Curetis has the right to resell such product components supplied under the agreement, except for the PCR Master Mix, in conjunction and jointly repackaged with Curetis’ products worldwide. Further, the agreement provides that Curetis has the right to resell the PCR Master Mix repackaged and refilled for use only in conjunction with Curetis’ products worldwide. Pursuant to the PCR Master Mix supply agreement, Curetis’ distribution right is limited to the sale to end-users and Curetis’ distributors and does not include sales to users who re-sell Curetis products in modified form (e.g. using their own brand) or sales, which would violate any sanctions, embargos or foreign trade restrictions issued by the EU or the United States. Further, Curetis, or any of its affiliates or distributors, are not permitted to resell any of the product components, including the PCR Master Mix, to third parties as stand-alone items for use other than in conjunction with Curetis’ products. Under the agreement, Curetis is subject to certain minimum annual purchase requirements.
Raw Materials and Suppliers for Acuitas 



OpGen procures PCR amplification reagents and the QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System from Thermo Fisher Scientific. DNA purification reagents and the EZ1 DNA Purification System are procured from Qiagen. We also purchase our collection kits from sole-source suppliers. Some of these items are unique to these suppliers and vendors. While we have developed alternative sourcing strategies for these materials and vendors, we cannot be certain whether these strategies will be effective or whether alternative sources will be available when we need them. If these suppliers can no longer provide us with the materials we need to manufacture our Acuitas AMR Gene Panel products, if the materials do not meet our quality specifications, or if we cannot obtain acceptable substitute materials, our business would be negatively affected.
Seasonality of Business



We do not believe our business is subject to significant seasonality. However, our business can be subject to and affected by the business practices of our business partners. To the extent that the availability of inventory or materials from or development practices of our partners is seasonal, our sales may be subject to fluctuations quarter to quarter or year over year.
Quality Assurance



Our quality and regulatory affairs functions oversee the quality of our research and development operations, laboratories and our FDA-cleared and CE-IVD-marked diagnostic products as well as the quality systems used in research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization such as client services, billing operations and sales and marketing. We have established quality management systems across our entire business, including implementation and maintenance, document control, supplier qualification, corrective or preventive actions, oversight, and employee training processes. We monitor and seek to improve our quality over time in compliance with all applicable regulations.
Payments and Reimbursements



Our Unyvero tests and Acuitas AMR Gene Panel tests are, and other future products and services will be, sold to hospitals, laboratories, and public health organizations as products and on a fee-for-service basis. When hospital and health system clients purchase our products, we bill them directly for the purchase of test kits and consumables. We believe that hospitals will recoup costs of our products and services by obtaining reimbursement from the government or private insurance companies for in-bed occupancies, which traditionally includes all testing required for admitted patients. When our tests are used prior to hospital admission, hospitals, clinical laboratories, and other healthcare provider customers that purchase our products may bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our products.



In the IVD market, sales volumes and prices of innovative products will depend, in large part, on  the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, which includes depending on public funding through governmental programs, private insurance plans and workers’ compensation plans. In most healthcare settings, reimbursement schemes are complex, processes to achieve reimbursement for new technologies are tedious and time consuming and payers may deny coverage or reimbursement. As a result, even though a new product may have been cleared for commercial distribution, it may find limited demand for the product until reimbursement approval has been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. However, specific reimbursement codes for laboratory tests are, in most countries, only applicable for out-patient healthcare. In addition, in most countries, some public funding is already available for certain established tests and is often technology specific, thus code stacking or cross-walking and using corresponding codes is quite usual to overcome challenging reimbursement situations.








22
--



OpGen has analyzed existing reimbursement schemes in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as other European countries and the United States, where hospitalized in-patients with severe infections are typically covered under the Diagnosis Related Group, or DRG, system. With DRG, hospitals receive a lump-sum payment, e.g., up to €22 thousand in Germany for a life-threatening case of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treated in intensive care. Therefore, OpGen has taken the strategic direction to target hospitalized patients first as in most countries DRG systems as hospitals’ general financing are in place covering diagnostics as part of a lump sum payment per patient without specific reimbursement codes for a laboratory test required.



In addition, the current list prices and future anticipated prices for Unyvero Application Cartridges and Acuitas AMR Gene Panel consumables, amount to a small fraction of this overall DRG payment. It is also favorable in some countries, such as the United States, that pathogen identification by a lab test may even warrant coding to higher DRG rates. For example, OpGen’s marketing team has been working with outside consultants to correctly position the LRT Application Cartridge in the context of relevant DRG codes so that, based on the pathogens identified by the LRT Application Cartridge as the causative agent of pneumonia but undetected by conventional microbiology, it can offer hospitals more favorable DRG coding and higher reimbursement on a per patient case overall.



OpGen’s management believes that existing DRG reimbursement scheme codes and optimization potential based on a Unyvero or Acuitas diagnostic within those applicable DRGs and their national equivalents can be used in most major markets and therefore an adoption of the Unyvero and Acuitas technology seems feasible.



Intellectual Property



In order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. To that end, in order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We, therefore, rely on a combination of patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contracts, such as confidentiality, invention assignment and licensing agreements. We also rely upon trade secret laws to protect unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation. In addition, we have what we consider to be reasonable security measures in place to maintain confidentiality. Our intellectual property strategy is intended to develop and maintain our competitive position.



As of December 31, 2022, OpGen had a patent portfolio of 52 granted patents and 18 patent applications. 30 of the granted patents and 3 of the pending patent applications are from Curetis and 19 of the granted patents and 15 of the pending patent applications are from Ares Genetics. As part of such portfolio, we have three granted U.S. patents related to our Acuitas products.



As part of the Company’s portfolio, there are two pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 8 issued U.S. patents related to our FISH products. These issued patents begin to expire in November 2024 and will be fully expired by October 2033. We are currently in the process of sunsetting our FISH intellectual property. 



We have ownership rights to 8 issued U.S. patents related to our Argus products. These issued patents begin to expire in November 2026 and will be fully expired by July 2031.  We are currently in the process of sunsetting our Argus intellectual property. 



We intend to file additional patent applications in the United States and abroad to strengthen our intellectual property rights; however, our patent applications (including the patent applications listed above) may not result in issued patents in a timely fashion or at all, and we cannot assure investors that any patents that have been issued or might be issued will protect our technology.



We require all employees and technical consultants working for us to execute confidentiality agreements, which provide that all confidential information received by them during the course of the employment, consulting or business relationship be kept confidential, except in specified circumstances. Our agreements with our research employees provide that all inventions, discoveries, and other types of intellectual property, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, conceived by the individual while he or she is employed by us are assigned to us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that employees and consultants will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.

Regulation



The following is a summary of the regulations materially affecting our business and operations.



Federal Oversight of Research-Use-Only Products



We currently offer for sale and sell some of our Unyvero tests to CROs, pharmaceutical companies, reference laboratories, hospitals and other health care facilities for research use only (RUO). RUO and investigational use only, or IUO, products are not intended for human clinical use and must be properly labeled in accordance with FDA guidance. Claims for RUOs and IUOs related to safety, effectiveness, or clinical utility or that are intended for human diagnostic or prognostic use are prohibited. In November 2013, the FDA issued guidance titled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only – Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.” This guidance sets forth the requirements to utilize such designations, labeling requirements and acceptable distribution practices, among other requirements.



Mere placement of an RUO or IUO label on an IVD product does not render the device exempt from otherwise applicable clearance, approval or other requirements. The FDA may determine that the device is intended for use in clinical diagnosis based on other evidence, including how the device is marketed.



Our Unyvero UTI assay was launched for RUO purposes in the second quarter of 2020. We cannot predict the potential effect the FDA’s current and forthcoming guidance on IUOs/RUOs will have on our product offerings or materials used to perform our diagnostic services. We cannot be certain that the FDA might not promulgate rules or issue guidance documents that could affect our ability to purchase materials necessary for the performance of our diagnostic services. Should any of the reagents obtained by us from vendors and used in conducting our diagnostic services be affected by future regulatory actions, our business could be adversely affected by those actions, including increasing the cost of service or delaying, limiting or prohibiting the purchase of reagents necessary to perform the service.



We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including premarket review, will not be required in the future for our surveillance and diagnostic services, whether through additional guidance or regulations issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by the U.S. Congress. We expect that new legislative proposals will be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA, which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our diagnostic services or to develop and introduce new services.



FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements



The FDA has broad authority over the regulation of medical devices marketed for sale in the United States. The FDA regulates the research, clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, promotion, distribution and production of medical devices. The FDA also regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets.



Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, the FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes: Class I, Class II or Class III. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed into either Class I or Class II.



Class I devices are deemed to pose the lowest risk to the patient. Accordingly, Class 1 devices are subject to the lowest degree of regulatory scrutiny and need only comply with the FDA’s General Controls. The General Controls include compliance with the registration, listing, adverse event reporting requirements, and applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation, or QSR as well as the general misbranding and adulteration prohibitions. Unless specifically exempted in the regulations, general controls require a company that intends to market a Class I device, like us, to gain clearance for marketing through the 510(k) process. Many Class I devices, however, are exempt from 510(k) clearance because the level of risk is low.



Class II devices are considered higher risk devices than Class I devices. Class II devices are subject to General Controls as well as additional special controls. Special controls may include labeling requirements, mandatory performance standards, and post market surveillance. Generally, companies that intend to market Class II devices, like us, must comply with applicable regulations and submit a 510(k) premarket submission for review to receive clearance to list and market their devices. The 510(k) must establish substantial equivalence to a predicate device. Some Class II devices are exempt from filing a 510(k) but in some instances, Class II devices may be required to file a premarket approval, or PMA, application, for example, when changes in their technology or intended use present novel risks that warrant separate review as a Class III medical device.



Class III devices are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices for which no substantially equivalent previously cleared device exists and require a PMA before commercialization.










24
--



All medical device manufacturers must register their establishments and list their devices with the FDA. Establishment registration requires the payment of user fees. In addition, both 510(k) premarket submissions and PMA applications are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review.



510(k) Clearance Pathway



We are currently working to submit our Unyvero tests for clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act. Such tests are classified as medical devices, and we have to submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of PMA applications. FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months; by statute, the FDA has 90 days to review the pre-market notification. On average the review time is approximately six months, but it can take significantly longer than twelve months in some instances (e.g. in the case of the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel as well as for the original Unyvero LRT products a total of over 18 months), as the FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.



After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a new 510(k) notice, or a PMA, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. We have made, and plan to continue to make, additional product enhancements to products that we believe do not require new 510(k) clearances, but we cannot guarantee that the future enhancements, should they occur, will be exempt from new 510(k) clearances.



De Novo Classification Request



The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, or FDAMA, added the De Novo classification option as an alternate pathway to classify low to moderate risk novel medical devices that had automatically been placed in Class III after receiving a not substantially equivalent determination in response to a premarket notification 510(k) submission. FDAMA also permits a sponsor to submit a De Novo classification request to the FDA for a product otherwise requiring a PMA application without first being required to submit a 510(k) application. The De Novo classification process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. While the Unyvero LRT Application has been subject to the De Novo process, both the LRT BAL Application as well as the Acuitas AMR Gene Panel have been FDA-cleared as 510(k) submissions. We currently expect that the Unyvero UTI and IJI application cartridges will also fall under the De Novo process.
Premarket Approval Pathway



A PMA application must be submitted if a device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA application process is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, analytical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing, statutory preapproval inspections, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.



After a PMA application is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the “accepted application,” although, generally, review of the application can take between one and three years, but it may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The preapproval inspections conducted by the FDA include an evaluation of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, as well as inspections of the clinical trial sites by the Bioresearch Monitoring group to evaluate compliance with good clinical practice and human subject protections. New PMA applications or PMA application supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. Significant changes to an approved PMA require a 180-day supplement, whereas less substantive changes may utilize a 30-day notice, or the 135-day supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. None of our products are currently approved under a PMA.








25
--

Clinical Trials



Clinical trials are almost always required to support a De Novo or PMA application and are usually required to support non-exempt Class I and Class II 510(k) premarket submissions. Clinical trials may also be required to support certain marketing claims. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to file an investigational device exemption, or IDE application, with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to conducting the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as analytical, animal and laboratory testing results, manufacturing information, and an Investigational Review Board, or IRB, approved protocol showing that it is safe to test the device on humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA prior to initiation of enrollment of human subjects. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the investigational device exemption application is approved by the FDA. If the clinical trial design is deemed to be “non-significant risk,” the clinical trial may be eligible for the “abbreviated” IDE requirements; in some instances IVD clinical trials may be exempt from the more burdensome IDE requirements if the test uses a noninvasive sampling method, does not introduce energy into the subject, and is not used in a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another established medically diagnostic procedure or product. All clinical trials conducted to support a PMA application must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations and Federal and state regulations concerning human subject protection, including informed consent, oversight by an IRB and healthcare privacy requirements. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA or the IRB review board at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the study. Even if a study is completed, the results of our clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of our product. Similarly, in Europe the clinical study must be approved by the local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies of high-risk devices, by the Ministry of Health in the applicable country.



Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation



Numerous regulatory requirements apply to products classified as devices, such as ours, and would continue to apply. These include:




● | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the development and manufacturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval of product design modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our cleared devices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | notices of corrections or removals.
--+------------------------------------




OpGen’s Rockville, Maryland facility is currently still registered as a manufacturer with the FDA to manufacture our Acuitas products, whereas the Curetis facility in Bodelshausen, Germany is registered with the FDA for all Unyvero cartridge and consumable manufacturing. We commenced transferring the manufacturing of the Acuitas products to Curetis prior to year-end, and the transfer was successfully completed in early 2023, so going forward, our OpGen headquarters will act as initial importer and distributor of Unyvero and Acuitas products as well as a service lab for RUO Ares related NGS service offerings that are not currently governed by our quality management system (QMS), but it will no longer be a manufacturing site. We and any third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with quality system regulation and other regulations.

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which might include any of the following sanctions: (1) untitled letters, Form 483 observations, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; (2) unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; (3) customer notifications for repair, replacement and refunds; (4) recall, detention or seizure of our products; (5) operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; (6) refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA of new products or modified products; (7) operating restrictions; (8) withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; (9) refusal to grant export approval for our products; or (10) criminal prosecution.



After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: all of the relevant elements of the QSR, labeling regulations, restrictions on promotion and advertising, the medical device reporting (which requires the manufacturer to report to the FDA if its devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulations (which requires manufacturers to report certain recalls and field actions to the FDA), and other post-market requirements.



Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act



Under HIPAA, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers, such as us, and by certain vendors of ours, also known as our business associates. The regulations include limitations on the use and disclosure of protected health information and impose notification requirements in the event of a breach of protected health information. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. Penalties for violations of HIPAA regulations include civil and criminal penalties.



We have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with these regulations. The requirements under these regulations may change periodically and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially more expensive than under current requirements.



In addition to Federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality of health information that are applicable to our business. If our business expands internationally, we would be subject to compliance with other laws regarding confidentiality of health information and privacy.



New laws governing privacy may be adopted in the future as well. We have taken steps to comply with health information privacy requirements to which we are aware that we are subject. However, we cannot assure you that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Failure to comply with privacy requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.



Federal and State Physician Self-referral Prohibitions



As a manufacturer and seller of diagnostic tests, we are subject to the Federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, and to similar restrictions under the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law. Together, these restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payor for any clinical laboratory services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.



Both the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law contain an exception for compensation paid to a physician for personal services rendered by the physician. We have compensation arrangements with a number of physicians for personal services, such as clinical advisory board services, speaking engagements and other consulting activities. We have structured these arrangements with terms intended to comply with the requirements of the personal services exception to the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law.



However, we cannot be certain that regulators would find these arrangements to be in compliance with the Stark Law, the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, or similar state laws. We would be required to refund any payments we receive pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payor or the Medicare program, as applicable.



Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:




● | denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | possible exclusion from Federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s prohibition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.



Further, if we submit claims in violation of the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, we can be held liable to the payer for any reimbursement received for the services by us. Finally, other states have self-referral restrictions with which we have to comply that differ from those imposed by Federal and Maryland law. While we have attempted to comply with the Stark Law and the Maryland Physician Self-Referral Law, it is possible that some of our financial arrangements with physicians could be subject to regulatory scrutiny at some point in the future, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be found to be in compliance with these laws following any such regulatory review.



Federal and State Anti-Kickback Laws



The Federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Law makes it a felony for a person or entity to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any Federal healthcare program. A violation of the Anti-Kickback Law may result in imprisonment for up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 in the case of individuals and $500,000 in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-Kickback Law result in mandatory exclusion from Federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude healthcare providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other Federal healthcare programs. Actions which violate the Anti-Kickback Law also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act.



Although the Anti-Kickback Law applies only to Federal healthcare programs, a number of states, including Maryland, have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-Kickback Law pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payers. Violations of Maryland’s anti-kickback law are punishable by tiered criminal penalties based on the crime with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and fines of up to $200,000, or both. Civil penalties include three times the amount of any overpayment made in violation of the statute.



Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Law, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases.



In addition to statutory exceptions to the Anti-Kickback Law, regulations provide for a number of safe harbors. If an arrangement meets the provisions of a safe harbor, it is deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. An arrangement must fully comply with each element of an applicable safe harbor in order to qualify for protection. There are no regulatory safe harbors to the Maryland anti-kickback law.



Among the safe harbors that may be relevant to us is the discount safe harbor. The discount safe harbor potentially applies to discounts provided by providers and suppliers, including laboratories, to physicians or institutions. If the terms of the discount safe harbor are met, the discounts will not be considered prohibited remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Law. Maryland does not have a discount safe harbor.



The personal services safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Law provides that remuneration paid to a referral source for personal services will not violate the Anti-Kickback Law provided all of the elements of that safe harbor are met. One element is that if the agreement is intended to provide for the services of the physician on a periodic, sporadic or part-time basis, rather than on a full-time basis for the term of the agreement, the agreement must specify exactly the schedule of such intervals, their precise length, and the exact charge for such intervals.



Our personal services arrangements with some physicians may not meet the specific requirement of this safe harbor that the agreement specify exactly the schedule of the intervals of time to be spent on the services because the nature of the services, such as speaking engagements, does not lend itself to exact scheduling and therefore meeting this element of the personal services safe harbor is impractical. Failure to meet the terms of the safe harbor does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances.



While we believe that we are in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Law and the Maryland anti-kickback law, there can be no assurance that our relationships with physicians, academic institutions and other customers will not be subject to investigation or challenge under such laws. If imposed for any reason, sanctions under the Anti-Kickback Law and the Maryland anti-kickback law could have a negative effect on our business.

Other Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws



In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the Federal healthcare programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms “usual charge” and “substantially in excess” are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations.



Further, the Federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly submitting a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the Federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the Federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud, also known as qui tam lawsuits. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. It is not uncommon for qui tam lawsuits to be filed by employees, competitors or consultants.



Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs. Maryland has an analogous state false claims act applicable to state health plans and programs, as do many other states.



International Regulation



Sales of diagnostic tests like our Unyvero tests outside the United States would be subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we would need to obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. OpGen currently distributes its Unyvero products outside of the United States via a network of distribution partners. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly. If we elect to, or are required to, seek clearance of or approval for any of our products from the FDA, we may be able to commercialize such products with shorter lead time in international markets, but would need to establish international operations in order to do so.



In addition to regulation by foreign governments, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.



Environmental Matters



Our operations require the use of hazardous materials (including biological materials) which subject us to a variety of Federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. Some of these regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. We could be held liable for damages and fines as a result of our, or others’, business operations should contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances occur. We cannot predict how changes in laws or new regulations will affect our business, operations or the cost of compliance.
Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2022, we had 100 employees worldwide, with 24 employed at OpGen, Inc. in the United States, 62 employed at Curetis GmbH in Germany, and 14 employed at Ares Genetics GmbH in Austria. Of our 100 worldwide employees, 85 are full-time employees. Except for the managing director of Ares Genetics, our Austria-based employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement for employees of companies in the automated data processing and IT services industry. None of our other employees worldwide are subject to a collective bargaining arrangement. The 24 employees in the United States work in our Rockville, Maryland location or are field based marketing, sales, and service employees.



We compete in the highly competitive healthcare and life sciences industry. Our ability to operate and compete effectively and execute our strategy requires us to attract, develop and retain talented personnel for positions in research, quality assurance, clinical, commercial and other positions. Recruiting and retaining our personnel depends on factors, such as compensation and benefits, development and career opportunities, and work culture and environment. We accordingly invest in our employees in a number of different ways.

Culture



Our goal is to create and foster a culture of high performance and accountability through the attraction, retention and development of expert talent. We compete for top talent with effective recruitment strategies, well-defined roles and attractive total compensation packages. We keep talent engaged through appreciation, communication and creation of a great work environment based on our shared core values at OpGen: Ownership, Performance, Generosity, Enthusiasm, Now! We support employee growth professionally and personally through formal and informal opportunities and leadership support.
Compensation



In addition to competitive base salaries, we offer incentive-based compensation programs tied to the performance of key objectives. We also provide compensation to our managers and employees in the form of restricted stock unit grants and stock options.
Health & Wellness



The physical health and wellbeing, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to our success. Throughout 2021 and 2022, health and wellness was a key focus of the Company, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of our employee communications focused on the physical and mental health of our employees. We remain committed to providing our workforce with flexible remote working schedules to suit their personal needs through this challenging time. We also continue to benchmark all of our health insurance offerings to ensure plan competitiveness.



Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, employee safety has been a top priority. Ongoing safety measures were put into place at each of our locations including implementing pre-screening and social distancing requirements in addition to providing personal protective equipment and regular testing of staff wherever possible.
