ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview

AmpliTech Group Inc. (“AMPG,” “AmpliTech” or the “Company”), incorporated in 2010 in the state of Nevada, is the parent company of AmpliTech, Inc., and the Company’s divisions, Specialty Microwave, Spectrum Semiconductor Materials, AmpliTech Group MMIC Design Center (“AGMDC”) and AmpliTech Group True G Speed Services (“TGSS”).

AmpliTech, Inc. designs, engineers and assembles micro-wave component-based amplifiers that meet individual customer specifications. Our products consist of Radio Frequency (“RF”) amplifiers and related subsystems, operating at multiple frequencies from 50kHz to 44GHz, including low noise amplifiers (“LNA”), medium power amplifiers, cryogenic amplifiers, and custom assembly designs for the global satellite communications, telecom (5G & IoT), space, defense, and quantum computing markets. We also offer non-recurring engineering services on a project-by-project basis, for a predetermined fixed contractual amount, or on a time plus material basis. We have both domestic and international customers in such industries as aerospace, governmental, defense and commercial satellite. 

Specialty Microwave designs and manufactures state-of- the-art precision SATCOM microwave components, RF subsystems and specialized electronic assemblies for the military and commercial markets, flexible and rugged waveguides, wave guide adapters and more.

On November 19, 2021, AMPG entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Spectrum Semiconductor Materials Inc. (“SSM”), a globally authorized distributor of integrated circuit (IC) packaging and lids for semiconductor device assembly, prototyping, testing, and production requirements founded in 1990 and headquartered in San Jose, CA, pursuant to which AMPG acquired substantially all of the assets of the Company (the Acquisition). The Acquisition was completed on December 15, 2021.

In 2021, the Company opened AGMDC, a monolithic microwave integrated circuits (“MMIC”) chip design center, in Texas and has started to implement several of its proprietary amplifier designs into MMIC components. MMICs are semiconductor chips used in high-frequency communications applications. MMICs are widely desired for power amplification solutions to service emerging technologies, such as phased array antennas and quantum computing. MMICs carry a smaller footprint enabling them to be incorporated into a broader array of systems while reducing costs.  AGMDC designs, develops and manufactures state-of-the-art signal processing components for satellite and 5G communications networks, defense, space and other commercial applications, allowing the Company to market its products to wider base of customers requiring high technology in smaller packages.

In August 2022, AmpliTech Group True G Speed Services (“TGSS”) division was formed to enable “true G speeds” to the industry.  TGSS’ main function will be to plan and configure 5G radio systems and make them O-RAN compliant.  TGSS will implement AmpliTech’s low noise amplifier devices in these systems to promote greater coverage, longer range and faster speeds.

Our mission is to patent our proprietary IP and trade secrets that were used in small volume niche markets and expand our capabilities through strategic partnerships, joint ventures, mergers/acquisitions with key industry leaders in the 5G/6G, quantum computing, and cybersecurity markets. We believe this will enable us to scale up our products and revenue by developing full systems and subsystems with our unique technology as a core component, which we expect will position us as a global leader in these rapidly emerging technology sectors and addresses large volume markets as well, such as cellphone handsets, laptops, server networks, and many other applications that improve everyday quality of life.

The Company’s research and development initiative to expand its product line of low noise amplifiers to include its new 5G and wireless infrastructure products and MMIC designs is progressing significantly. Our combined engineering and manufacturing resources are expected to complement the development of new subsystems for satellite, wireless, and 5G infrastructures, as well as advanced military and commercial markets.

Our Corporate History and Structure

AmpliTech Group Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010. On August 13, 2012, the Company acquired AmpliTech Inc., by issuing 833,750 shares of the Company’s common stock to the shareholders of AmpliTech Inc. in exchange for 100% of the outstanding shares of AmpliTech Inc. (the “Share Exchange”). After the Share Exchange, the selling shareholders owned 60,000 shares of the outstanding 893,750 shares of Company common stock, resulting in a change in control. Accordingly, the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition in which AmpliTech, Inc. was deemed to be the accounting acquirer, and the operations of the Company were consolidated for accounting purposes. The capital balances have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the reverse acquisition.

On September 12, 2019, AmpliTech Group Inc. acquired substantially all of the assets of Specialty Microwave Corporation, a privately held company based in Ronkonkoma, NY. The purchase included all inventory, orders, customers, property and equipment, and goodwill. Following the closing of the asset purchase, we hired all eight team members of SMW. In connection with the acquisition, the Company began using the trade name “Specialty Microwave”. The total consideration paid was $1,143,633, consisting of $668,633 in cash and a $475,000 promissory note with an interest rate of 6%. 

On February 17, 2021, AmpliTech Group Inc.’s common stock and warrants commenced trading on NASDAQ under the symbols “AMPG” and “AMPGW,” respectively. A reverse split of the outstanding common stock at a 1-for-20 ratio became effective February 17, 2021, as of 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time. All share amounts have been retroactively re-stated to reflect the reverse split.

On November 19, 2021, AmpliTech Group, Inc. entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with SSM, pursuant to which AmpliTech would acquire substantially all of the assets of SSM. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was $10,123,276, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments. $665,200 of the aggregate purchase price was paid by the issuance of 188,442 unregistered shares of AmpliTech common stock at the closing of the acquisition. The Acquisition was completed on December 15, 2021.

In 2021, the Company opened a MMIC chip design center in Texas and has started to implement several of its proprietary amplifier designs into MMIC components. MMICs are semiconductor chips used in high-frequency communications applications. MMICs are widely desired for power amplification solutions to service emerging technologies, such as phased array antennas and quantum computing. MMICs carry a smaller footprint enabling them to be incorporated into a broader array of systems while reducing costs.

In August 2022, TGSS division was formed to enable “true G speeds” to the industry.  TGSS’ main function will be to plan and configure 5G radio systems and make them O-RAN compliant.  TGSS will implement AmpliTech’s low noise amplifier devices in these systems to promote greater coverage, longer range and faster speeds.

The COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted and affected our business operations, which has led to business and supply chain disruptions. The lingering effects of the pandemic are likely to continue to disrupt our business and supply chain in the future. For example, our offices and R&D and manufacturing locations had been, and may continue to be, impacted due to national and regional government declarations requiring closures, quarantines, and travel restrictions, although nearly all government-imposed restrictions have been significantly reduced in most parts of the world. However, given the unpredictable nature of COVID-19 and its variants, it is difficult, if not impossible, to predict, whether any government-imposed restrictions will be reimposed at previous levels or enhanced in one or more ways impacting our business operations or those of third parties upon which we rely. The COVID-19 pandemic, including associated business interruptions and recovery, as well as other possible epidemics or outbreaks of other contagions could result in a material adverse impact on our or our current or anticipated customers’ or suppliers’ business operations, including reduction or suspension of operations in the U.S. or other parts of the world. Our design and engineering operations, among others, cannot all be conducted remotely and often require on-site access to materials and equipment. We have customers, suppliers, and partners with international operations, and our customers, suppliers, and partners also depend on suppliers and manufacturers worldwide, which means that our business and prospects could be affected by the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic anywhere in the world. Depending upon the duration of the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated business interruptions, our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, and partners may suspend or delay their engagements with us. We and our customers’ and suppliers’ response to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove to be inadequate and they may be unable to continue their respective operations in the manner they had prior to the outbreak or the worsening of the outbreak, and we may consequently endure interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, and shipments, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, we cannot assure you as to the timing of the economic recovery given the lingering effects of the pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our target markets and our business.
