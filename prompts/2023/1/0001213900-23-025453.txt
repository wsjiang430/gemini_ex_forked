ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview



We are engaged in the development, marketing, manufacturing, acquisition, operation and sale of a broad spectrum of nutritional and related products with an emphasis on health and wellness. Structured as a global holding company, we are executing a buy-and-build strategy with serial accretive acquisitions creating a vertically integrated company with an objective of aggregating companies generating a minimum of $300 million in revenues by the fourth quarter of 2026. To drive growth and earnings, we are developing proprietary products as well as acquiring other profitable companies, encompassing brands, manufacturing and distribution channels.



We also operate a network platform in the affiliate marketing space. Affiliate marketing is an advertising model in which a product vendor compensates third-party digital marketers to generate traffic or leads for the product vendor’s products and services. The third-party digital marketers are referred to as affiliates, and the commission fee incentivizes them to find ways to promote the products being sold by the product vendor.



Business Model



We are engaged in a comprehensive program to develop a robust pipeline of prospective acquisitions in addition to the companies currently operated by us. Our management has significant experience in locating and evaluating prospective target operating companies. We have also entered into buy-side agreements with certain advisers and consultants to assist management in identifying and evaluating prospective target operating companies. The nutritional products industry is highly fragmented with a large pool of companies generating less than $20 million in revenues representing significant opportunity for industry consolidation.



We plan to acquire target companies utilizing a combination of cash, promissory notes, earnouts and public company stock, generally at 4x to 6x trailing adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Aside from our first acquisition described below, we intend on paying no more than 60% cash on any acquisition that we execute with a target of 50%. The remainder is allocated between stock and a note and/or earnout with a heavier weighting toward the former. Although the acquisition consideration is structured, we believe that our acquisitions will provide three distinct benefits to the principals of an acquisition - first, a significant liquidity event; second, the creation of a significant equity position in an emerging growth public company; and third, ongoing employment at customary industry compensation.



We plan to acquire multiple companies aggregating a minimum of $300 million in annualized revenues by the fourth quarter of 2026. We do not currently have sufficient capital to complete these acquisitions. We intend to raise capital for additional acquisitions primarily through debt financing at our operating company level, additional equity offerings by our company, or by undertaking a combination of any of the above. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.



There is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire additional businesses under the terms outlined above or that we will be able to find additional acquisition candidates should we terminate our plans for any of our current acquisition targets.



Corporate History and Structure



Our company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on February 2, 2017 under the name Bonne Santé Group, Inc. On August 4, 2021, we changed our name to Smart for Life, Inc. in connection with the acquisition of DSO described below.



On March 8, 2018, we acquired 51% of Millenium Natural Manufacturing Corp. and Millenium Natural Health Products Inc. for a purchase price of $2,140,272. On October 8, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 49% of these companies, which was completed on October 8, 2019. On September 30, 2020, we changed the name of Millenium Natural Manufacturing Corp. to Bonne Sante Natural Manufacturing, Inc., or BSNM, and on November 24, 2020, we merged Millenium Natural Health Products Inc. into BSNM to better reflect our vertical integration.

As a result, these entities are now wholly owned subsidiaries of Doctors Scientific Organica, LLC. In this report, we collectively refer to Doctors Scientific Organica, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries as DSO.



On August 24, 2021, we established Smart for Life Canada Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary of Doctors Scientific Organica, LLC in Canada. This subsidiary sells retail products through a retail store location in Montreal Canada and the same location also acts as distribution center for our international direct to consumer and big box customers. We maintain inventory and employees at this location.



On July 21, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, which was amended on November 8, 2021, to acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Nexus Offers, Inc., or Nexus. On November 8, 2021, the acquisition was completed.

On July 29, 2022, the acquisition was completed.



On August 15, 2022, we organized Smart Acquisition Group, LLC in the State of Florida. This subsidiary is 50% owned by our company and 50% owned by Stuart Benson, the former owner and principal of Ceautamed. This special purpose subsidiary is dedicated exclusively to the identification, negotiation, financing, and acquisition of companies synergistic to our buy-and-build business model.



Corporate Structure



The following charts depict our organization structure.

Our Industry 



The markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, established and emerging competition, extensive intellectual property disputes and litigation, price competition, aggressive marketing practices, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences. Accordingly, our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies operating in rapidly changing and competitive markets.
Nutraceutical Industry



The nutraceutical industry focuses on nutritional supplements intended to improve longevity, sports fitness and provide health benefits in addition to the basic nutritional value present in food. Most people are familiar with various nutraceutical products—and have likely used them—even if they are unfamiliar with the industry name. Nutraceuticals comprise such commonly used items as herbal products, specific diet products, vitamins, processed foods and beverages, functional foods, isolated nutrients and other dietary products. Functional foods are foods that have a potentially positive effect on health beyond basic nutrition. A familiar example of a functional food is oatmeal because it contains soluble fiber that can help lower cholesterol levels. Some foods are also modified to have health benefits. An example is orange juice that has been fortified with calcium for bone health.



The following table prepared by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (www.crnusa.org), or CRN, depicts the types of supplements taken by the population in the different indicated categories beginning in 2018 and estimated through 2027. We sell products across all of these product categories, and we believe that our market share in each of these categories is currently less than 1%.




SOURCE: Council for Responsible Nutrition



The nutraceutical industry has experienced significant growth across the globe, propelled by the increasing age expectancies and associated increases in diseases of aging and lifestyle. A shift in demographics has also allowed manufacturers to benefit in recent years. The number of Americans ages 65 and older is projected to nearly double from 52 million in 2018 to 95 million by 2060, and the 65-and-older age group’s share of the total population will rise from 16% to 23%. Moreover, the CRN reported 77% of U.S. adults take dietary supplements.



Nutraceuticals are garnering immense attention in recent years due to various trends including changing lifestyles, burgeoning middle-class segment across emerging economies, transforming dietary habits, aging population, and increased life expectancy. In addition, the focus of R&D based pharmaceutical sector on expensive specialty drugs is increasing the burden on the healthcare system as well as resulting in higher out-of-pocket costs for drugs driving the focus on prevention than intervention. The self-care trend across the world is driving strong demand for nutraceuticals including superfoods, food and dietary supplements, sports nutrition, and functional foods and beverages. Given the hectic lifestyles and the lack of time for consumption of the required nutrients through regular diet, the need for replenishing such essential nutrients is increasing. In this context, nutraceuticals are emerging to be the solution for meeting this requirement. Nutraceuticals are considered to be the vital link between health and food.



The market is also experiencing strong demand for personalized approaches to wellness that is driving product innovation in the areas of weight management, sports nutrition, and healthy snacking. Other noteworthy trends benefiting market prospects in the near term include emergence of clean labeling as a new norm owing to increasing focus of consumers on ingredient list on the product; innovative delivery technologies such as microencapsulation, which protects the product from adverse conditions such as light and air.



As the overall population continues to turn to healthier living in hopes of offsetting rising healthcare expenditures and preventing general subpar health conditions, we believe that the demand for nutraceutical industry products will resemble a similar trend.

Digital Marketing



As a result of our acquisition of Nexus, we have entered the digital marketing industry as a way to promote the products and brands that we sell. Digital marketing is a component of marketing that uses internet and online based digital technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones and other digital media and platforms to promote products and services.



The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in people staying at home and/or working remotely from home, resulting in huge increase in online traffic. Clicks and display ads are among the most prominent forms of digital marketing initiatives. Clicks are expensive compared to display ads, as clicks ensure the customer is directed to the advertiser’s website. However, clicks provide a better return on investment.



Our Operating Subsidiaries



BSNM



BSNM is a nutraceutical contract manufacturer. Since 1998, our strong manufacturing capabilities and dedication to our clients has enabled us to build relationships with hundreds of customers throughout the United States and around the world, including South America, Central America and Europe. We specialize in a wide variety of products to fill our client’s needs, from the private labeling of vitamins, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, sport nutrition and broad-spectrum nutritional supplements. Our experienced team of scientists, formulators, and manufacturing experts have the years of knowledge necessary to take our client’s concepts all the way from initial idea to finished product. In addition, we can provide the support for a simple and cost-effective “turn key” solution to manufacturing existing formulations.



To meet the specific demands of any order, we have state-of-the-art manufacturing and packaging lines to decrease cost and maximize efficiencies. We certify that all products and labels meet stringent U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, requirements and our quality control associates will continually monitor the entire process until products are delivered. Our goal is to exceed our customer’s expectations with respect to product quality, service and price.



DSO



DSO manufactures, sells and owns the Smart for Life brand of natural health and wellness meal replacement products. The brand includes proprietary hunger suppressing functional foods that are designed to work with the body’s natural ability to lose weight. The program uses an exact protein-to-sugar ratio, a low glycemic index and glycemic load as well as multiple small meals throughout the day to deliver specific amounts of protein, super fibers and complex carbs to suppress hunger, keep sugar and insulin low and trigger the body’s release of the fat releasing hormone glucagon.



Our Smart for Life products deliver:




● | Hunger controlling protein mix 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No toxins or preservatives

DSO has over 15 years of experience providing high-quality products to premium retail locations and companies. DSO branded vitamins and supplements are also being sold through Amazon, and this sales channel is becoming a major contributor to the growth of the brand online. All products are packaged in eco-friendly and bio-degradable packaging.

GSP



GSP is a sports nutrition company. It offers nutritional supplements for athletes and active lifestyle consumers through a variety of wellness solutions and delivery methods, including powders, tablets and soft gels that are formulated to support energy and performance; nutrition and wellness; and focus and clarity.



GSP’s initial line of nutritional products are marketed under the Sports Illustrated Nutrition brand. The product line currently consists of whey protein isolate powder, tablet supplements for joint health, nitric oxide, post workout blends, Omega-3 supplements, and pre-workout supplements, among others.



We believe that the Sports Illustrated brand is one of the most recognized brands in sports and athletics. GSP has a license for the exclusive use of the Sports Illustrated brand (excluding the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit brand for which it has a right of first offer under the license) for certain dietary and nutritional supplements, in each case to be sold to/through certain approved accounts in the United States and Canada. See “—Intellectual Property” below for additional details regarding this license.



Ceautamed



Ceautamed is based in Boca Raton, Florida and is primarily engaged in the development and distribution of a wide variety of nutritional products, including antioxidant rich supplements, plant-based protein, alkalizing nutrients and products designed for weight management.



Ceautamed owns the Greens First line of branded products which have been specifically marketed to the healthcare provider sector. These vitamins and supplements have been sold on a business-to-business basis, direct-to-consumer, as well as sold utilizing an international medical distribution company.



The mission is to create a healthier world with nutritious wellness products made from the highest quality ingredients for superior benefits.



Nexus



Nexus operates a cost per action/cost per acquisition network. This network consists of hundreds of digital marketers who stand ready to market products introduced to the Nexus network. The cost per action/cost per acquisition model is where digital marketers are paid for an action (e.g., a product sale or lead generation) that is taken as a direct result of their marketing efforts. Through the digital marketer’s method of marketing, the digital marketer sends traffic to one of the product vendor’s offers listed on the network. 



Nexus has relationships with both product vendors and digital marketers. A product vendor is a Nexus customer that has products, whether digital or physical, for sale and is looking for increased sales through digital marketing avenues from digital marketers. Digital marketers are Nexus contractors that engage in digital marketing. An example of a digital marketer is someone who has a strong Facebook following, or a strong knowledge of Facebook ad marketing. Other examples include google ad marketing or email marketers who send marketing messages to an opted in list of subscribers. Historically, Nexus’ customers consisted exclusively of owners of digital products that were also delivered digitally. Following our acquisition of Nexus, BSNM, DSO, GSP and Ceautamed, as well as any additional nutraceutical companies that we acquire in the future, will also become customers of Nexus. Nexus will use its online marketplace to market our nutraceutical products through its network of digital marketers. Our nutraceutical product companies will then sell and physically deliver the nutraceutical products to the end users identified through the efforts of the digital marketers. Nexus has the ability to “plug and play” with any of the products sold by companies that we may acquire in the future as we can take the consumer facing products being sold by those companies and seamlessly add them to the Nexus network to generate sales.



Product vendors come to Nexus to increase sales of their products and digital marketers come to Nexus to receive a commission in exchange for their marketing efforts, which are designed to generate sales for the product vendors. When a digital marketer’s marketing efforts results in a sale of a product by a product vendor, the digital marketer is then credited with a commission. The product vendor is billed weekly for the sales that the product vendor makes during the week as the result of such digital marketers’ marketing efforts. The product vendor pays Nexus and Nexus pays the digital marketer. This is an anonymous transaction as digital marketers and product vendors are only defined inside the marketplace by an offer name (product vendor) and an affiliate number (digital marketer).

Manufacturing, Distribution and Quality Control 



BSNM operates a 22,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Doral, Florida. This facility primarily focuses on the contract manufacturing of vitamins and supplements, with a particular emphasis on the production of tablets, capsules and powders, along with turn-key solutions for packaging these health and wellness products in a wide variety of bottles, jars, sachets and stick packs. From inception through December 31, 2022, it has manufactured nutritional products for approximately 245 companies, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, it manufactured nutritional products for approximately 23 companies.



DSO operates a 30,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Riviera Beach, Florida. This facility is primarily focused on the production of natural health and wellness meal replacement products, including nutrition bars, cookies, soups and shakes, as well as some vitamin and supplement capabilities such as powders. In addition to our own products, DSO manufactures products on behalf of third parties. From inception through December 31, 2022, it has manufactured nutritional products for approximately 29 companies, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, it manufactured nutritional products for approximately 21 companies.



GSP and Ceautamed rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture their products.



All our manufacturing operations are subject to good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, promulgated by the FDA and other applicable regulatory standards. We believe our manufacturing processes comply with the GMPs for dietary supplements or foods, and our manufacturing and distribution facilities generally have sufficient capacity to meet our current business requirements and our currently anticipated sales. We place special emphasis on quality control. We assign lot numbers to all raw materials and initially hold them in quarantine while our quality department evaluates them for compliance with established specifications. Once released, we retain samples and process the material according to approved formulas by blending, mixing and technically processing as necessary. We manufacture products in final delivery form as a capsule, tablet, powder, or nutrition bar. After a product is manufactured, our laboratory analysts test its weight, purity, potency, disintegration and dissolution, if applicable, utilizing both internal equipment and third-party labs. We hold the product in quarantine until we complete the quality evaluation and determine that the product meets all applicable specifications before packaging. When the manufactured product meets all specifications, our automated packaging equipment packages the product with at least one tamper-evident safety seal and affixes a label, an indelible lot number and, in most cases, the expiration or “best by” date.



Our manufacturing operations are designed to allow low-cost production of a wide variety of products of different quantities, physical sizes and packaging formats, while maintaining a high level of customer service and quality. Flexible production line changeover capabilities and reduced cycle times allow us to respond quickly to changes in manufacturing schedules and customer demands.



We have inventory control systems at our facilities that track each manufacturing and packaging component as we receive it from our supply sources through manufacturing and shipment of each product to customers. To facilitate this tracking, most products we sell are bar coded. We believe our distribution capabilities increase our flexibility in responding to our customers’ delivery requirements.



Raw Materials and Suppliers



In fiscal 2022 and 2021, we spent approximately $9,335,000 and $3,454,000, respectively, on raw materials, excluding packaging and similar product materials. The principal raw materials required in our operations are vitamins, minerals, herbs, and gelatin. We believe that there are adequate sources of supply for all our principal raw materials, and in general we maintain two to three suppliers for many of our raw materials. From time to time, weather or unpredictable fluctuations in the supply and demand may affect price, quantity, availability, or selection of raw materials. We believe that our strong relationships with our suppliers yield high quality, competitive pricing, and overall good service to our customers. Although we cannot be sure that our sources of supply for our principal raw materials will be adequate in all circumstances, we believe that we can develop alternate sources in a timely and cost-effective manner if our current sources become inadequate. During fiscal 2022, two raw material suppliers, American International Foods and Univar USA, accounted for 16% and 11%, respectively, our raw material purchases. Due to availability of numerous alternative raw material suppliers, we do not believe that the loss of any single raw material supplier would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. See Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—An increase in the price and shortage of supply of key raw materials could adversely affect our business.”

Sales and Marketing



We employ many different techniques and strategies within our marketing initiatives. These include direct to consumer outreach, use of influencers through social media, Facebook targeting, focused e-mail campaigns, and traditional media. Our marketing goal is always to increase visibility and relevance of our brands in the minds of our customers and potential customers. We hope to expand our programs to include experimental marketing techniques in the future.



We recently shifted the marketing focus of Nexus to target the nutraceutical industry away from all other efforts, which we believe will become a value-added component of our marketing strategies.



Customers



BSNM, DSO, GSP and Ceautamed primarily sell products to customers under individual purchase orders placed by them under their standard terms and conditions of sale. These terms and conditions generally include insurance requirements, representations by us with respect to the quality of our products and our manufacturing process, our obligations to comply with law, and indemnifications by us if we breach our representations or obligations. There is no commitment from any customer to purchase from us, or from us to sell to them, any minimum amount of product. During fiscal 2022, Amazon and Costco, accounted for 30% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenues.



Ceautamed has also entered distribution agreements with Boxout whereby it acts as an exclusive distributor of certain of Ceautamed’s products to professional health and wellness providers and service locations, and to any distributors selling to such providers and locations, within the U.S. and Canada, as well as through e-commerce websites Amazon, Ebay and Walmart.



As described above, Nexus’ customers are product vendors. Although the number of customers that Nexus has fluctuates from year to year, it has established long-term relationships with its significant product vendors, but it does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers. The relationship with customers can be terminated at any time by either party; however, as a result of Nexus’ extensive network of digital marketers, which drive sales for product vendors, the average length of Nexus’ relationships with its significant customers is 3 years. Most of Nexus’ customers are acquired through existing customer referrals. Nexus also attends Internet marketing conferences to promote is service.



The loss of any major customer would have a material adverse effect on us if we were unable to replace that customer. See Item 1A “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Our major customers account for a significant portion of our consolidated net sales and the loss of any major customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.”



Competition



The nutraceutical industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include a number of large, nationally known brands such as Nature Made (Pharmavite), Nature’s Bounty, GNC, Spectrum (Hain Celestial), Country Life, Garden of Life and Jarrow Formulas, and many smaller brands, manufacturers and distributors. The sales of products through online marketplace platforms such as Amazon and firms’ websites continue to expand. Private label products also provide competition to our products. Whole Foods Market, Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and many health stores also sell a portion of their nutritional supplement offerings under their own private labels. Private label products are often sold at a discount to branded products. We also compete with distributors that sell products to health stores as well as mass market retailers such as United Natural Foods and KeHE Distributors. In addition, several major pharmaceutical companies continue to offer nutritional supplement lines in the mass market, including Centrum (Pfizer and GSK) and One-A-Day (Bayer). Pharmaceutical companies also offer prescription and over-the-counter products that are or may be competitive with nutritional supplements, particularly with regard to certain categories of products. Finally, as the nutraceutical market generally has low barriers to entry, additional competitors enter the market regularly.



Nexus’ competitors would be any digital marketing agency in the cost per acquisition space looking to acquire exclusive advertiser offers and high end publishers who can send high amounts of traffic through digital marketing media. Examples include Ca$hNetwork, OfferBlueprint and MaxBounty.

Competitive Strengths



Based on management’s belief and experience in the industry, we believe that the following competitive strengths enable us to compete effectively.




● | Proprietary manufacturing facilities. BSNM and DSO own and operate proprietary manufacturing facilities, which allow for a high level of managerial control over all aspects of production, including sourcing, logistics and maintaining the highest levels of quality during the manufacturing process. Through direct ownership, we are able to optimize our sales and marketing practices and provide a completely integrated approach, all solidified by a single manufacturing platform for capsules, tablets, powders and various other delivery methods for all vitamins and supplements. In addition, as a private label contract manufacturer for third parties, we can provide a turnkey solution for brands and retailers who want to minimize their supply chain disruption and maximize their control over product flow to end customers. In addition, as a middle market-sized contract manufacturer, we are not encumbered by the often overly complex processes that our larger competitors may have. We can be nimble and highly adaptable, “flexing” with our customers’ needs as they change over time, which allows us to better service our ever-expanding international client base. We are able to maintain a competitive advantage due to our vertically integrated operational control. This vertical integration also allows us to minimize intellectual property and data security risks, while also eliminating costs, improving focus, optimizing quality and launching with a faster time-to-market for new products. We retain control over every step of the manufacturing processes, allowing us to establish our own institutional advantages and maximize efficiencies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Established and trusted brands. Smart for Life, Doctors Scientific Organica, Sports Illustrated Nutrition and Greens First are well-established brands in the in the health and wellness industry. In particular, Smart for Life products are currently sold in many of the largest big-box retailers in the United States and Canada, including Costco, Walmart, Sam’s Club, BJ’s and Publix, as well as through online channels such as Amazon. DSO has established a dedicated following of consumers that are strong believers in the high-quality vitamins and supplements it sells to its customers, along with the eco-friendly and bio-degradable packaging, with Amazon sales numbers continuing to increase as a result. We believe that the Sports Illustrated brand is one of the most recognized brands in sports and athletics. In connection with our acquisition of GSP, we acquired a license for the exclusive use of the Sports Illustrated brand (excluding the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit brand for which we have a right of first offer under the license) for certain dietary and nutritional supplements, in each case to be sold to/through certain approved accounts in the United States and Canada. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Client focused innovative research and development. We believe that our research and development team adds significant value to our company and our customers and is a differentiating factor for our company. We strive to be technology driven leveraging technology, science, and innovation in our research and development efforts. We work closely with our clients to create and develop new and exciting products. We frequently work directly with our customers in our research and development labs to create innovative solutions that create value for our customers in a timely manner. Our team works closely with physicians to create novel wholesome products that add nutritional and functional value. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ability to market through captive marketing subsidiary. We believe that our subsidiary, Nexus, allows us access to a broad spectrum of marketing tools to be utilized across the entire spectrum of our products. We believe that having an experienced management team and existing customer base accessible to all of our other brands in our portfolio will allow us to drive sales and revenue of existing products as well as test new product offerings generated through our research and development. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Referral only network based on long term relationships. Nexus operates a referral only network, meaning that all of its digital marketers are referred. There is no way to get a Nexus account other than being directly referred by a known good account holder. This allows Nexus to stem any fraudulent traffic, which we believe is a substantial competitive advantage for product vendors. Nexus has also established long term relationships with its product vendors and offers competitive bonuses for its digital marketer base. We believe that these factors set Nexus apart from its competition. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategies



We will strive to grow our business by pursuing the following growth strategies.




● | Acquisition of additional businesses. The nutritional products industry is highly fragmented with a large pool of companies generating less than $20 million in revenues representing significant opportunity for industry consolidation. As noted above, we plan to acquire multiple companies aggregating a minimum of $300 million in annualized revenues by the fourth quarter of 2026. As noted above, we also do not currently have sufficient capital to complete these acquisitions. We intend to raise capital for additional acquisitions primarily through debt financing at our operating company level, additional equity offerings by our company, or by undertaking a combination of any of the above. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. There is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire additional businesses under the terms outlined above or that we will be able to find additional acquisition candidates should we terminate our plans for any of our current acquisition targets.

● | Increase sales from existing and new customers. We expect to continue to drive growth for our consumer products branded business through our increased focus on our top brands and continued expansion in various health and wellness categories, which we expect to result in incremental shelf space with existing customers and new customer additions. We expect that our focus on delivering tangible benefits to consumers through product innovation will not only benefit us but also benefit our customers. Our ability to supply both branded and private label products broadens and deepens our partnerships with key retail customers, providing us more opportunities for category leadership and growth. We view the private label business as an important and valuable service that we provide to key accounts.

● | Further penetrate international markets. Our products are currently marketed and sold in approximately two countries. In fiscal 2022, approximately 10% of our sales were to customers outside the United States. We plan to capitalize on our marketing and distribution capabilities to drive incremental international sales of our consumer product brands in emerging markets, which are characterized by a rising middle class and a strong demand for high quality nutritional and wellness products from U.S.-based manufacturers.

● | Drive productivity through operational efficiencies. We expect to continue to focus on improving efficiency across our operations to allow us to reduce costs in our manufacturing facilities as well as across our overhead cost areas. Our recent acquisition of DSO significantly increased our production capacity. In addition, we have launched an initiative to optimize our product portfolio, which we expect will enable further efficiencies across our manufacturing network. We are also introducing new initiatives that leverage automation, standardization and simplification and are expected to increase productivity across our operations.

Intellectual Property



We believe trademark protection is particularly important to the maintenance of the recognized brand names under which we market our products. We own or have rights to material trademarks or trade names that we use in conjunction with the sale of our products, including the Smart for Life, Doctors Scientific Organica, Greens First, and Sports Illustrated Nutrition brand names. We also own website domain names and have proprietary methodologies that we use in our manufacturing businesses. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.



In January 2020, GSP entered into a license agreement, which was amended on June 1, 2020 and August 1, 2021, for the exclusive use of the Sports Illustrated brand (excluding the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit brand for which GSP has a right of first offer under the license) in the United States and Canada for dietary and nutritional supplements in the form of capsules, softgel tablets, chewable tablets, lozenges, gummies, protein bars, and protein powders and concentrates for preparing sports drinks or energy drinks, and the non-exclusive right to use the brand for the production and sale of shaker bottles, in each case to be sold to/through certain approved accounts in the United States and Canada.



As consideration for the license, GSP must pay royalties in an amount that is between 4% and 14% of net sales (as defined in the license agreement) with certain amounts guaranteed in advance. The aggregate amount of such guaranteed royalties is $1 million for the initial term of the license agreement. In addition, GSP must contribute an amount ranging between 1% and 3% of its net sales to a common marketing fund, to be spent on an annual basis on marketing efforts, including advertising and promotional campaigns.



The license agreement has a term of five years ending on December 31, 2024, with a right to renew for an additional five-year term by providing written notice of renewal between June 1, 2023 and July 31, 2023. The licensor may terminate the license agreement upon breach by GSP of the payment or other terms of the license agreement (which is not cured within the applicable cure period, if any, if such breach is capable of cure) or in the event of certain other customary termination events.  GSP may terminate the license agreement upon a material breach by the licensor if such breach is not cured with thirty (30) business days of the licensor’s receipt of written notice thereof.

We protect our intellectual property rights through a variety of methods, including trademark, patent and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and others who have access to our proprietary information. Protection of our intellectual property often affords us the opportunity to enhance our position in the marketplace by precluding our competitors from using or otherwise exploiting our technology and brands. We are also a party to several intellectual property license agreements relating to certain of our products. The duration of our trademark registrations is generally 10, 15 or 20 years, depending on the country in which the marks are registered, and we can renew the registrations. The scope and duration of our intellectual property protection varies throughout the world by jurisdiction and by individual product. Our global trademark portfolio, with the aforementioned registration durations, consists of our core marks for our business and our proprietary product brands which drive significant brand awareness for all of our businesses.  Our proprietary product formulas and recipes, maintained as trade secrets, are significant to our growth and success as they form the foundation for our production and sales of effective, high quality products.



Employees



As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 145 employees with approximately 68 of such employees being engaged in our manufacturing operations and the balance being engaged in management or middle management. None of our employees are represented by labor unions, and we believe that we have an excellent relationship with our employees.
Regulation



Our business is subject to varying degrees of regulation by a number of government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or the CPSC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or the USDA, and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA. Various agencies of the state and localities in which we operate and in which our products are sold also regulate our business.



The areas of our business that these and other authorities regulate include, among others:




● | product claims and advertising; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product labels; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | product ingredients; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | how we manufacture, package, distribute, import, export, sell and store our products. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In addition, our products sold in foreign countries are also subject to regulation under various national, local and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements and over-the-counter drugs.



As a result of the acquisition of Nexus, we are also subject to laws and regulations generally applicable to providers of digital marketing services, including federal and state laws and regulations governing data security and privacy, unfair and deceptive acts and practices, advertising and content regulation.



We are also subject to a variety of other regulations in the United States, including those relating to taxes, employment, import and export, and intellectual property.



Food and Drug Administration



The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements. Generally, under the FDC Act, dietary ingredients (i.e., vitamins; minerals; herb or other botanical; amino acids; or dietary substances for use by humans to supplement diet by increasing total dietary intake; or any concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any of the above) that were marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. New dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. Such a determination could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredient.

In 2011 and 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance setting forth recommendations for complying with the new dietary ingredient notification requirement. Although FDA guidance is non-binding and does not establish legally enforceable responsibilities, and companies are free to use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of applicable laws and regulations, FDA guidance is a strong indication of the FDA’s current thinking on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement. At this time, it is difficult to determine whether the 2016 draft guidance (which replaced the 2011 draft guidance), if finalized, would have a material impact on our operations. However, if the FDA were to enforce the applicable statutes and regulations in accordance with the draft guidance as written, such enforcement could require us to incur additional expenses, which could be significant, and negatively impact our business in several ways, including, but not limited to, enjoining the manufacturing of our products until the FDA determines that we are in compliance and can resume manufacturing, increasing our liability and reducing our growth prospects.



The FDA or other agencies could take actions against products or product ingredients that, in their determination, present an unreasonable health risk to consumers that would make it illegal for us to sell such products. In addition, the FDA could issue consumer warnings with respect to the products or ingredients in such products that are sold in our stores. Such actions or warnings could be based on information received through FDC Act-mandated reporting of serious adverse events.



We take a number of actions to ensure the products we sell comply with the FDC Act.  Some of these actions include maintaining and continuously updating a list of restricted ingredients that will be prohibited from inclusion in any products that we sell.  In addition, we have developed and maintain a list of ingredients that we believe comply with the applicable provisions of the FDC Act. As is common in our industry, we rely on some third-party vendors to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. In general, we seek representations and warranties, indemnification and/or insurance from our vendors. However, even with adequate insurance and indemnification, any claims of non-compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. In addition, the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from the market, which in certain cases could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A removal or recall could also result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. In the past, we have attempted to offset any losses related to recalls and removals with reformulated or alternative products; however, there can be no assurance that we would be able to offset all or any portion of losses related to any future removal or recall.



The FDC Act permits structure/function claims to be included in labels and labeling for dietary supplements without FDA pre-market approval. However, companies must have substantiation that the claims are “truthful and not misleading”, and must submit a notification with the text of the claims to the FDA no later than 30 days after marketing the dietary supplement with the claims. Permissible structure/function claims may describe how a particular nutrient or dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or characterize the documented mechanism of action by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function. The label or labeling of a product marketed as a dietary supplement may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat or prevent a disease (i.e. a disease claim). If the FDA determines that a particular structure/function claim is an unacceptable disease claim that causes the product to be regulated as a drug, a conventional food claim or an unauthorized version of a “health claim,” or, if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific data or is false or misleading in any particular, we would be prevented from using the claim and would have to update our product labels and labeling accordingly.



In addition, DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature,” e.g., “a publication, including an article, a chapter in a book, or an official abstract of a peer-reviewed scientific publication that appears in an article and was prepared by the author or the editors of the publication” supplements, when reprinted in its entirety, may be used “in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers” without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature: (1) must not be false or misleading; (2) may not “promote” a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement; (3) must present a balanced view or is displayed or presented with other such items on the same subject matter so as to present a balanced view of the available scientific information; (4) if displayed in an establishment, must be physically separate from the dietary supplements; and (5) should not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating such literature with our products, and any continued dissemination could subject our product to regulatory action as an illegal drug.

In June 2007, pursuant to the authority granted by the FDC Act as amended by DSHEA, the FDA published detailed GMP regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. The GMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers. The GMP requirements are in effect for all dietary supplement manufacturers, and the FDA conducts inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements. There remains considerable uncertainty with respect to the FDA’s interpretation of the regulations and their actual implementation in manufacturing facilities.



In addition, the FDA’s interpretation of the regulations governing dietary supplements will likely change over time as the agency becomes more familiar with the industry and the regulations. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the GMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility “adulterated,” and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions. In addition, under the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, which was enacted in January 2011, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements will be subject to similar or even more burdensome manufacturing requirements, which will likely increase the costs of dietary ingredients and will subject suppliers of such ingredients to more rigorous inspections and enforcement. The FSMA will also require importers of food, including dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, to conduct verification activities to ensure that the food they might import meets applicable domestic requirements.



The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import, require the reporting of serious adverse events, require a recall of illegal or unsafe products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the United States courts.



The FSMA expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production and importation of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA’s ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products, and require certification of compliance with domestic requirements for imported foods associated with safety issues. FMSA also gave FDA the authority to administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process. The regulation of dietary supplements may increase or become more restrictive in the future.



Federal Trade Commission



The FTC exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of dietary supplements and other health-related products and requires that all advertising to consumers be truthful and non-misleading. The FTC actively monitors the dietary supplement space and has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. FTC enforcement actions may result in consent decrees, cease and desist orders, judicial injunctions and the payment of fines with respect to advertising claims that are found to be unsubstantiated.
Environmental Regulation 



Our facilities and operations, in common with those of similar industries making similar products, are subject to many federal, state, provincial and local requirements, rules and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and of human health and safety, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. We continually examine ways to reduce our emissions, minimize waste and limit our exposure to any liabilities, as well as decrease costs related to environmental compliance. Costs to comply with current and anticipated environmental requirements, rules and regulations and any estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not anticipated to be material when compared with overall costs and capital expenditures. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that such costs will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position.
New Legislation or Regulation



Legislation may be introduced which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements and other health products. We cannot determine what effect additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, would have on our business in the future. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation, impose additional record keeping or require expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling or scientific substantiation.
