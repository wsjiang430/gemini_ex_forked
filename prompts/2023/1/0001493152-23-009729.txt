On February 13, 2022 the Company formed LBI, which is being developed as a full retail, guided tour and training model utilizing the technology developed by BLU3 to provide new users and interested divers a guided tour experience, training, and the ability to purchase all of their diving and watersports needs. 
 
On May 2, 2022, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Gold Coast Scuba, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Gold Coast Scuba”), Steven M. Gagas and William Frenier, the sole members of Gold Coast Scuba (together, the “LLC Members”) and LBI. Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, LBI acquired substantially all of Gold Coast Scuba’s assets and assumed certain non-material liabilities of the business associated with these assets. In addition, LBI assumed the lease for the premises for Gold Coast Scuba.
 
The Company has five subsidiaries focused on various sub-sectors of our industry as described below:
 

● | Brownie’s Third Lung | Surface Supplied Air (“SSA”) 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | BLU3, Inc. | Ultra-Portable Tankless Dive Systems 
● | LW Americas | High Pressure Gas Systems 
● ● | Submersible Systems, Inc. | Redundant Air Tank Systems Live Blue, Inc. | Guided Tours 

 
Our wholly owned subsidiaries do business under their respective trade names on both a wholesale and retail basis from our headquarters and manufacturing facility in Pompano Beach, Florida, and a manufacturing facility in Huntington Beach, California.
 

Surface Supplied Air Products
 
Our Third Lung systems have been the market leader in gasoline powered, high-performance and more recently in the battery powered SSA diving systems. Taking full advantage of our proprietary compressor system, a series of traditional “fixed speed” electric compressors were developed for the built-in-boat market in 2005. In 2010, we introduced our variable-speed battery powered hookah system which provides divers with gasoline-free all day shallow diving experiences. These systems provide performance and runtimes for up to 3 hours by utilizing a variable speed technology that controls battery consumption based on diver demand.
 
In 2022, we continued to expand our dealer network and our marketing efforts with both the consumer and our network of dealers. The Company continues to pursue distributors and dealers outside of the United States in order to diversify the seasonality as well as geography risks. Additionally, we continue to pursue more aggressively the boat builder market to offer our SSA systems as an option on newly built boats, expanding our market beyond the traditional consumer markets for our products.
 
Our SSA products include:
 
● Tankless Dive Systems: The Company produces a line of tankless dive products, commonly called hookah or recreational SSA systems. These systems allow one to four divers to enjoy the marine environment up to a depth of 45 feet without the bulk and weight of conventional SCUBA gear. We believe that the removal of barriers to entry into the sport of diving and the reduction of complicated and bulky SCUBA gear invites a broader range of the general public to participate more actively and enjoyably at their own pace and schedule. Our product is designed to reduces the effort required for its transport and use while exploring, cruising or traveling.
 
A line of land-based systems is available for light-duty commercial applications that demand portability and performance. In addition to the gasoline-powered units and the variable speed battery powered units, a series of AC electric powered systems is also available for light to commercial use. Powered by battery for portability or household current for unlimited dive duration, these units are used primarily by businesses that work in aquatic maintenance and marine environments.

● BIAS (Boat Integrated Air Systems): The Company developed several tankless products and complimentary accessories that it believes makes boat diving easier. The BIAS battery powered tankless kit allows boat builders, dealers and end users to seamlessly install a pre-packaged kit directly into the boat and our E-Reel, a level-winding battery powered hose reel system, provides compact storage of up to 150 feet of hose. Boaters can perform their own in-water maintenance and inspections, or just dive for enjoyment. In addition to supplying air to divers, BIAS may be used for supporting air horns, inflating boat fenders/water toys and activating pneumatically operated doors.
 

Ultra-Portable Tankless Dive Systems
 
Through our wholly owned subsidiary BLU3, we develop and market a next generation electric, surface supplied air shallow dive system that is completely portable to the user. The BLU3 line currently consists of two models, NEMO and NOMAD, targeting specific performance levels and price points.
 
NEMO dive systems are currently sold in various countries through Amazon, and also through dealers worldwide. NEMO, designed to be the world’s smallest dive system is capable of taking a diver to 10 feet for 60 to 90 minutes on one charge of its lithium-ion battery. NEMO is portable and its batteries are FAA compliant for airline travel.
 
NOMAD dive system (“NOMAD”) began shipping in the third quarter of 2021 and is currently sold to consumers via our website, Amazon and through our network of dealers worldwide. The NOMAD is highly portable and expands dive capability to up to 30 feet. NOMAD has been marketed through BLU3’s internet presence and marketing campaigns as well as at industry and other trade shows across the country.
 
BLU3 continues to innovate in the SSA sector and currently expects to introduce a new product to its line-up in 2023.
 
We believe the BLU3 product lines are changing the way that people get into the water and explore the next atmosphere. The units are ultra-portable and can travel with the consumer to their adventures, wherever they may be.
 

High Pressure Gas Systems
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary LW Americas, we design, manufacture, sell and install SCUBA tank fill systems for on-board yacht use under the brand “Yacht-Pro™”. Our systems provide complete diving solutions for yachts, including nitrox systems which allow yacht owners to fill tanks with oxygen enriched air on board. The Yacht-Pro™ compressor systems offer a completely marine-prepared, variable frequency drive (“VFD”) driven, automated alternative to other compressors on the market. We also design complete dive lockers, mixed gas production and distribution systems, and the Nitrox Maker™. Nitrox is oxygen-enriched air, which reduces the effects of nitrogen on divers and is the industry standard for dive professionals. The Nitrox Maker™ continuously generates oxygen rich breathing gas directly from low-pressure air with no stored oxygen or other gases required onboard. Our light duty compressor, the new Yacht Pro Essential is specifically designed as a turn-key kit for the boat builders and is optimized to integrate to onboard power systems and withstand the marine environment with all components and hardware impervious to spray from the elements. The Yacht Pro™ series contains models for both medium-duty applications, such as recreational divers and small groups, and heavy-duty use as found on research vessels, commercial operations and live-aboard dive boats. All Yacht Pro™ models come with the variable speed frequency drive reducing the initial start-up power demand typically associated with high pressure compressor systems.

Suppliers/Raw Materials
 
Principal raw materials for our business include machined parts such as rods, pistons, bearings, hoses, regulators, compressors, engines, high-pressure valves and fittings, sewn goods, and various plastic parts including pans, covers, intake staffs, and quick release connections which are typically purchased on a per order basis. Most materials are readily available from multiple vendors. Some materials require greater lead times than other materials. Accordingly, we strive to avoid out of stock situations through careful monitoring of these inventory lead times, and through avoiding single source vendors whenever possible. Principle suppliers include Lenhardt & Wagner GmbH, Xometry, Inc., Burgess Manufacturing Corp, Bix International, Inc., Carrol Stream Motor Company, Zhejiang Xiangyang Gear Electormechan, Co, Tian Li He Technology Co, Ltd, Xiamen Feipeng Insdustry Co. Ltd. and Catalina Cylinders, Inc.
 
Competition
 
We consider the most significant competitive factors in our business to be innovation, lifestyle, fair prices, shopping convenience, variety of available products, knowledgeable and prompt customer service and rapid and accurate order fulfillment. We currently have one significant competitor within the BTL business model, Airline by JSink, Inc. There are a variety of competitors, including Aqua Lung America, Coltri America and Bauer Compressors, Inc. in our redundant air tank systems and high-pressure compressor systems sales. In 2022 competition has surfaced in the BLU3 business segment from companies such as AirBuddy, and a few other very low-cost Chinese manufactured competitors.
 
Overall, we are operating in a moderately competitive environment. The price structure for all the products we distribute compares favorably with the majority of our competitors based on quality and available features. We believe that our key competitive advantage is our ability to create new products and, in some cases, new markets.
 
Employees 
 
We currently have thirty-six full-time employees, and four part-time employees.
 
Seasonality 
 
Our product lines have historically been seasonal in nature in the United States. The peak season for the diving related products, BTL, BLU3, SSI and LBI is the second and third quarters of the year. The peak season for high pressure products is typically the fourth and first quarters of the year. The Company continues to address the seasonality of the business by expanding its reach beyond the traditional markets in the U.S. to other areas of the world that may somewhat offset the seasonality.
