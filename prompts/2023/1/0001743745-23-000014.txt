ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General
Founded in 2005, Greenlane is a premier global platform for the development and distribution of premium cannabis accessories, vape devices, and lifestyle products. In 2021, we completed several transformative acquisitions, including the acquisition of two proprietary house brands, EYCE (“Eyce”) and DaVinci (“DaVinci”), along with a larger merger with KushCo Holdings, adding a significant industrial line of business to the Greenlane platform. These acquisitions strengthened our leading position as a consumer ancillary products house-of-brands business by adding two established brands to our portfolio (Eyce and DaVinci), and significantly expanded our customer network, bringing strategic relationships with leading cannabis multi-state-operators (“MSOs”), cannabis single-state operators (“SSOs”), and Canadian licensed-producers (“LPs”). Greenlane provides a wide array of consumer ancillary products and industrial ancillary products to thousands of cannabis producers, processors, brands, and retailers (“Cannabis Operators”), in addition to specialty retailers, smoke shops, head shops, convenience stores, and consumers directly through our own proprietary web stores and large online marketplaces such as Amazon. 
We have been developing a world-class portfolio of our own proprietary brands (the "Greenlane Brands") that we believe will, over time, deliver higher margins and create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Our wholly-owned Greenlane Brands includes our recently launched more affordable product line – Groove, our innovative silicone pipes and accessories line – Eyce, our best-in-class premium vaporizer brand – DaVinci, our premium smoke shop and ancillary product brand – Higher Standards, and our child-resistant packaging brand - Pollen Gear. We also have category exclusive licenses for the premium Marley Natural branded products, as well as the Keith Haring branded products. 
The Greenlane Brands, along with a curated set of third-party products, are offered to customers through our proprietary, owned and operated e-commerce platforms which include Vapor.com, Vaposhop.com, DaVinciVaporizer.com, PuffItUp.com, HigherStandards.com, EyceMolds.com, and MarleyNaturalShop.com. These platforms allow us to reach customers directly with helpful resources and a seamless purchasing experience.
We merchandise vaporizers, packaging, and other ancillary products in the United States, Canada, Europe and Latin America. We distribute products to retailers through wholesale operations and distribute products to consumers through e-commerce activities and our flagship Higher Standards store in New York City's famed Chelsea Market. We operate our own distribution centers in the United States, while also utilizing third-party logistics ("3PL") locations in the United States, Canada, and Europe. We have made tremendous progress consolidating and streamlining our warehouse and distribution operations following our acquisitions in 2021, and we look forward to further optimization of our footprint in 2023. 
We manage our business in two different, but complementary, business segments. The first is the Consumer Goods segment, which focuses on serving consumers across wholesale, retail, and e-commerce operations—offering both our Greenlane Brands, as well as ancillary products and accessories, from select leading third-party brands, such as Storz and Bickel, Grenco Science, PAX, Cookies and more. The Consumer Goods segment forms a central part of our growth strategy, especially as it relates to scaling our own portfolio of higher-margin proprietary owned brands. In addition to our Consumer Goods segment, we have our Industrial Goods segment, which focuses on serving Cannabis Operators by providing ancillary products essential to their daily operations and growth, such as packaging and vaporization solutions, including our Greenlane Brand Pollen Gear. Refer to "Note 11— Segment Reporting" within Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our reportable segments.
Organization
Greenlane Holdings, Inc. (“Greenlane” and, collectively with the Operating Company (as defined below) and its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”, "we", "us" and "our") was formed as a Delaware corporation on May 2, 2018. We are a holding company that was formed for the purpose of completing an underwritten initial public offering (“IPO”) of shares of our Class A common stock on April 23, 2019 and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of Greenlane Holdings, LLC (the “Operating Company”). The Operating Company was organized under the laws of the state of Delaware on September 1, 2015, and is based in Boca Raton, Florida. Refer to "Note 1—Business Operations and Organization" within Item 8 for further information on the Company's organization and the IPO and related transactions. We are the sole manager of the Operating Company and, as of December 31, 2022, owned a 100% interest in the Operating Company.
Our Business Relating to the Cannabis Industry
The information included below is based on the most recent information available to the Company and, except as expressly stated below, does not give effect to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; the long-term impacts of which remain uncertain as of the date of this Form 10-K. 
While we do not cultivate, distribute or dispense marijuana as that term is defined by the Controlled Substances Act, several of the products we distribute, such as vaporizers, pipes, rolling papers, and packaging solutions, can be used with marijuana or marijuana derivatives, as well as several other legal substances.
We believe the global cannabis industry is experiencing a transformation from a state of prohibition toward a state of legalization. We expect the number of states, countries, and other jurisdictions legalizing cannabis for medical and adult use will continue to increase, which will create numerous opportunities for market participants, including us. 
U.S. Cannabis Landscape
A January 2022 report of Cowen and Company, one of the leading investment banks and equity research firms serving the cannabis industry, estimated that spending in the U.S. legal cannabis market was approximately $18.9 billion in 2020 and reached approximately $25.3 billion in 2021, representing growth of approximately 33.9%. The report projects that by 2030, spending in the U.S. legal cannabis market will reach $64.9 billion, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11% over the nine-year period from 2021. Our experience and awareness of the markets in which we operate lead us to believe that demand for the types of products we sell should grow in tandem with the industry.
The North American Cannabis Landscape
United States and Territories.  Twenty-one states, and the District of Columbia, have legalized cannabis for non-medical adult use with additional states, such as Ohio, actively considering the legalization of cannabis for non-medical adult use. An additional eighteen states have legalized medical cannabis in some form, with certain of those states permitting only low tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC") oils for a limited class of patients. Notwithstanding the continued trend toward further state legalization, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Federal Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”) and, accordingly, the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis violate federal law in the United States as discussed further in Item 1A under the heading "Risk Factors." However, President Biden announced on October 6th, 2022, that he has asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services, along with the Attorney General, to initiate the administrative process to expeditiously review how cannabis is scheduled under Federal law which, combined with other statements, suggests cannabis’ current Schedule 1 status pursuant to the CSA may be set to improve in the not-too-distant future. Our business depends partly on continued purchases by businesses and individuals selling or using cannabis and cannabis ancillary products pursuant to state laws in the United States.
Canada.
Legal access to dried cannabis for medical purposes was first allowed in Canada in 1999. The Cannabis Act (the “Cannabis Act”) currently governs the production, sale and distribution of medical cannabis and related oil extracts in Canada.
On April 13, 2017, the Government of Canada introduced Bill C-45, which proposed the enactment of the Cannabis Act to legalize and regulate access to cannabis. The Cannabis Act proposed a strict legal framework for controlling the production, distribution, sale and possession of medical and recreational adult-use cannabis in Canada. On June 21, 2018, the Government of Canada announced that Bill C-45 received Royal Assent. On July 11, 2018, the Government of Canada published the Cannabis Regulations under the Cannabis Act, which has been subsequently amended. The Cannabis Regulations provide more detail on the medical and recreational regulatory regimes for cannabis, including regarding licensing, security clearances and physical security requirements, product practices, outdoor growing, packaging and labelling, cannabis-containing drugs, document retention requirements, reporting and disclosure requirements, the new access to cannabis for 
medical purposes regime and industrial hemp. The majority of the Cannabis Act and the Cannabis Regulations came into force on October 17, 2018, with additional Cannabis regulations coming into effect on October 17, 2019.
While the Cannabis Act provides for the regulation by the federal government of, among other things, the commercial cultivation and processing of cannabis for recreational purposes, it provides the provinces and territories of Canada with the authority to regulate in respect of the other aspects of recreational cannabis, such as distribution, sale, minimum age requirements, places where cannabis can be consumed, and a range of other matters.
The governments of every Canadian province and territory have implemented regulatory regimes for the distribution and sale of cannabis for recreational purposes. Most provinces and territories have announced a minimum age of 19 years old, except for Alberta, where the minimum age will be 18. Certain provinces, such as Ontario, have legislation in place that restricts the packaging of vapor products and the manner in which vapor products are displayed or promoted in stores.
The European Cannabis Landscape
Europe’s population is larger than that of the U.S. and Canadian markets combined, suggesting the potential of a very significant market. The changes in regulations for cannabis products across Europe are expected to result in a market growth. for medical cannabis, of approximately $13.37 billion in annual sales by 2027, a significant growth from approximately $4.96 billion in 2022.
Many European Union countries allow limited cannabis use for medicinal purposes, with some of those countries operating pilot programs. It has been widely reported that other countries are considering following suit. Additionally, certain countries in Europe, including Germany, are considering the adoption of laws that would legalize cannabis for adult use. 
Product Information
Consumers of cannabis, herbs, flavored compounds, aromatherapy oils, and nicotine require the types of products we distribute, including vaporizers, pipes, rolling papers and packaging. Producers of cannabis products are able to source compliant packaging, vape hardware, and other products needed in the manufacturing and distribution stages of the supply chain. We believe we distribute the “picks & shovels” for these rapidly-growing industries and producers. As the world of cannabis and its respective aesthetic continues to expand, we strive to keep our product mix relevant, popular, and innovative; offering an array of products from vaporizers, grinders, pipes and other inhalation devices to storage solutions, to rolling papers and even apparel lines. As our product offerings continue to develop, we expect our revenue by categories to increase accordingly.
Inhalation Delivery Methods
There are two prevalent types of inhalation methods for cannabis and nicotine: combustion and vaporization. Vaporizers are devices that heat materials to temperatures below the point of combustion, extracting the flavors, aromas and effects of dry herbs and concentrates in the form of vapor. Measured by revenue, vaporizers are our largest product category. 
The Science and Popularity of Vaporization
Vaporizers continue to increase in popularity and as a preferred method of consumption among a variety of demographics of consumers. They have elements that are designed to quickly heat material, causing vaporization to occur without the carbon dioxide that is typically generated through combustion. The vapor byproduct is then immediately inhaled through the mouthpiece on the device itself, or through a hose or an inflatable bag. Vaporizers can heat a variety of dry materials, viscous liquids and waxes, and provide a convenient way for users to consume the active ingredient such as tobacco, nicotine extracts, legal herbs, hemp-derived CBD, aromatherapy oils, cannabis, and propylene glycol and glycerin blends.
Vaporization Technology. Consumers have a wide array of vaporization devices at their disposal, which can be broadly categorized into two primary categories: desktop and portable vaporizers. Our vaporizer portfolio spans just shy of 200 distinct products across 12 brands.
Desktop Vaporizers.  Vaporizers were first developed as desktop models that were powered through traditional electric power sources. Desktop vaporizers are capable of heating the material to a more precise temperature choice determined by the consumer or as advised by a health practitioner.
Portable Vaporizers. With the development of lithium batteries, vaporizers have now become portable. Technological advances are resulting in lighter, sleeker, and more visually-appealing units that are capable of quickly heating material to the user’s desired temperature setting. Portable vaporizers, of which vape pens are a sub-set, are differentiated by many features, including output, battery life, recharge time, material, capacity, and design.
Other Methods of Consumption.  In addition to vaporizers, consumers have a wide array of methods of consumption at their disposal, including, hand pipes, water pipes, rolling papers, and oral and topical delivery methods.
Hand and Water Pipes. We offer a diverse portfolio of over 200 hand and water pipes across five brands, including products within our Greenlane Brands. Many display iconic, licensed logos and artwork, as pipes have grown into an artistic expression and are available in countless creative forms and functionality. Hand pipes are small, portable and simple to use, and function by trapping the smoke produced from burning materials. Water pipes include large table-top models, bubblers and rigs, and incorporate the cooling effects of water to the burning materials before inhalation.
Rolling Papers.  Rolling papers are a traditional consumption method used to smoke dried plant material in a "roll-your-own" application. These include papers, cones and wraps. Our rolling papers category is comprised of over 100 products across two unique brands, not including accessories such as rolling trays or tips. 
Our Competitive Strengths
We attribute our success to the following competitive strengths:
A Clear Market Leader in an Attractive Industry.
We are a leading global platform for the development and distribution of premium cannabis accessories, packaging, vape solutions, and lifestyle products, reaching thousands of retail locations, including, licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, head shops, and specialty retailers. We also own and operate one of the industry’s most visited North American direct-to-consumer e-commerce websites, Vapor.com, as well as PuffItUp.com, and Vaposhop which serves the European market. We also sell our proprietary products direct to consumers via DaVincivaporizer.com, Higherstandards.com, Eycemolds.com, and MarleyNaturalShop.com.
Market Knowledge and Understanding.
Because of our experience and our extensive, long-term industry relationships, we believe we have a deep understanding of customer needs and desires in our Consumer Goods and Industrial Goods business segments. This allows us to influence customer demand and the pipeline between product manufacturers, suppliers, advertisers and the marketplace. We have also established strong relationships with a wide array of industry participants including leading MSOs, SSOs, retailers, and third party ancillary product producers.
Comprehensive and Best-in-Class Product Offering.
We offer a curated portfolio of products and accessories across many major categories with diverse, best-in-class offerings that cater to our customers' needs. This comprehensive and best-in-class product offering creates a “one-stop shop" for many of our customers and positively distinguishes us from our competitors. In addition, we have carefully cultivated a portfolio of well-known brands and premium products and have helped many of the brands we distribute to become established names in the industry.
Entrepreneurial Culture.
We believe our entrepreneurial, results-driven culture fosters highly-dedicated employees who provide our customers with superior service. We invest in our talent by providing ongoing training and have successfully developed programs that provide comprehensive product knowledge and tools needed to have a unique understanding of our customers’ goals and decision-making processes.
Customers. We believe we offer superior services and solutions due to our comprehensive product offering, proprietary industry data and analytics, product expertise and quality of service. We deliver products to our customers in a precise, safe and timely manner with complementary support from our dedicated sales and service teams. In 2022, we launched our new business to business ("B2B") customer portal at Wholesale.Greenlane.com which provides our business customers seamless access to our catalog of products for purchase 24-hours a day, 365 days a year. Consumers can access our products easily by purchasing from our e-commerce properties or access many of our products via large marketplaces such Amazon.
Suppliers. Our industry knowledge, market reach, and resources allow us to establish trusted relationships with many industry suppliers. Our senior management team makes tremendous efforts to establish and build these key relationships to help ensure Greenlane has a strong supply chain established for in-demand products at favorable pricing. Our suppliers can be categorized into two buckets, factories that produce our Greenlane Brand’s products, as well as some generic products, and other third party branded products (who either manufacture themselves or outsource production) that Greenlane will, in essence, resell. While we purchase our products from over 150 suppliers, a significant percentage of our net sales is dependent on sales 
of products from a small number of key suppliers, which is why strong relationships are essential to our future success. An important reason we have elected to focus on our Greenlane Brands is, since we own the brand itself (or license it), we can control which factory produces our products. Generally, there are a variety of capable factory partners and we are able to leverage our Greenlane Brands to negotiate better pricing and service. When reselling an established third-party brand’s products, we are somewhat beholden to the one supplier who owns or distributes that brand. However, we do believe there is a trend of third-party branded suppliers in our industry to consolidate their relationships to do more business with fewer distribution partners. We believe our established track record, historical relationships, ability to be value-added, and overall size and scale position us to benefit from this trend. 
Employees. We aim to recruit best-in-class talent to join our Greenlane team. We provide our employees with an entrepreneurial culture, a safe, fun and fast-paced work environment, financial incentives and career development opportunities.
Experienced and Proven Management Team Driving Organic and Acquisition Growth. 
We recently revamped our management team to directly align with our strategic goals and initiatives. Our management team features vast relevant experience in consumer-packaged goods, product development, brand building, and e-commerce. In addition, our management team has expertise in accounting and finance, mergers and acquisitions, supply chain, information technology, and operations. Most importantly, our senior team has vast experience in the cannabis industry and other industries we serve, along with an understanding and appreciation for the historical and cultural nuances, including the social justice components.
Our Operating Strategies
We intend to leverage our competitive strengths to increase shareholder value through the following core strategies:
Plan to Accelerate Path to Profitability and Capitalize the Business
In today’s economic environment, not to mention the environment of the cannabis industry itself, the key focus for many companies is profitability. At Greenlane, we are hyper focused on getting our business profitable and well-capitalized for long-term sustainability. On March 10, 2022, we announced our strategic plan (the “2022 Plan”) to reduce our cost structure, increase liquidity and accelerate our path to profitability. The 2022 Plan included multiple reductions in force, reduction of facility footprints worldwide, a sale leaseback of our headquarters building, disposition of non-core assets, discontinuation of lower-margin third-party brands, increase of prices on select products, and securing an asset-based loan (with respect to the sale of the Company’s headquarters building, discontinuation and disposition of non-core and lower-margin inventory and securing an asset-backed loan, the “Liquidity Initiatives”). We have been working hard to right-size our business, focus on core areas, and reduce our overall cost structure while improving our margins in an effort to be profitable in 2023.
On June 22, 2022, we provided an update on the Liquidity Initiatives. The Liquidity Initiatives generated more than $30.0 million of liquidity on a non-dilutive basis by the end of 2022. On July 19, 2022, Warehouse Goods entered into that certain Membership Interest Purchase Agreement and supporting documents to sell our 50% stake in VIBES Holdings LLC for total consideration of $4.6 million in cash. Additionally, on August 9, 2022, we entered into an asset-based loan pursuant to that certain Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of August 8, 2022 (the “Loan Agreement”), by and among the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company as guarantors, the parties thereto from time to time as lenders (the “Lenders”), and WhiteHawk Capital Partners LP, as the agent for the Lenders. As described in the Loan Agreement, the Lenders agreed to make available to us a term loan of up to $15.0 million on the terms and conditions set forth therein and the other Financing Agreements (as defined therein). Subsequently, on August 16, 2022, 1095 Broken Sound Pwky entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with a third-party whereby 1095 Broken Sound agreed to sell a certain parcel of real estate including our headquarters building in Boca Raton, Florida for total consideration of $9.95 million, and on September 22, 2022 we closed on the sale.
In 2022, we announced our plans to divest our packaging division. The divestiture should allow us to further consolidate our warehouse footprint into one U.S. warehouse for our Consumer Goods and remaining Industrial Goods. This initiative, combined with restructuring some of our other initiatives, should allow us to reduce our overall cost-structure, and in combination, convert millions of dollars of inventory back into working capital, thereby significantly improving our balance sheet.
Finally, we are working to sell our excess & obsolete (“E&O”) inventory of lower-margin, non-strategic products, along with reducing our overall level of inventory on hand. In May 2022, we commenced our official E&O sales program internally and have since sold more than $4.1 million of previously reserved E&O inventory. Our management anticipates that the proceeds from these E&O sales, combined with a general sell-down of other non-core third-party brand inventory, will generate more than $10.0 million in liquidity.
Management believes that our strategic initiatives will significantly reduce costs, help accelerate the Company’s path to profitability, support the growth of the business in a non-dilutive manner, and allow the Company to reinvest capital into its highest margin and highest growth potential product lines, such as its Greenlane Brands.
Notwithstanding the 2022 Plan and Liquidity Initiatives, we were required to obtain additional capital through the sale of common stock and warrants in a public offering that closed in October 2022 and filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2023 seeking to register the offering of up to $8 million in units, which has not yet become effective. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources. The October 2022 offering was completed and the February 2023 Form S-1 was filed, in order to meet short term funding needs, and we are still seeking to execute our strategic and other liquidity initiatives.
Developing A World-Class Portfolio of Proprietary Brands. 
We intend to continue to develop a portfolio of our own proprietary brands (Greenlane Brands), which over time will help to increase our blended margins and create increased long-term value. Our brand development is based upon our proprietary industry intelligence that allows us to identify market opportunities for new brands and products. We leverage our distribution infrastructure and customer relationships to penetrate the market quickly with our proprietary brands and to gain placement in thousands of retail stores. Currently, we sell such products directly to consumers through our brand websites and our e-commerce properties. Over time, we expect an increasing percentage of our overall sales to be from our Greenlane Brands, which in turn should allow our gross margin to trend upwards and should allow for lasting brand value to be built in the marketplace.
USPS PACT Act Exemption
On January 11, 2022, we announced via press release that the United States Postal Service (the “USPS”) had approved our application for a business and regulatory exemption to the PACT Act (with respect to the business and regulatory exemption granted by the USPS, the “PACT Act Exemption”), allowing us to ship vaporizers and accessories classified as electronic nicotine delivery systems (“ENDS”) products to other compliant businesses. With this approval, over 97% of our total annual sales became eligible for shipment by freight, USPS and other major parcel carriers. The PACT Act Exemption also enables us to partner with other businesses that ship ENDS products and had their supply chains disrupted by PACT Act compliance.
On June 24, 2022, we provided via press release an update on the progress of the PACT Act Exemption, following our successful implementation of the controls, processes and systems required by the USPS in connection with the shipment of ENDS products. We expect the ability to fulfill ENDS orders with the USPS to allow us to reduce shipping costs, decrease fulfillment times and enhance the overall customer experience for approved wholesale customers.
Enhance Our Operating Margins. 
We expect to enhance our operating margins as our business expands through a combination of additional product purchasing discounts, reduced inbound and outbound shipping and handling rates, reduced transaction processing fees, increased operating efficiencies, and realization of benefits through leveraging our existing assets and consolidated distribution facilities. Additionally, we expect that our operating margins will increase as our product mix continues to evolve to include a greater portion of our Greenlane Brands, which generally offer significantly higher gross margins than third-party branded products. Lastly, we are focused on converting more of our overall sales to be completed through technology platforms such as our e-commerce consumer sites, large marketplace sites like Amazon, and our proprietary B2B ordering portal at Wholesale.Greenlane.com. Transacting a higher percentage of our sales through automated technological platforms, versus the manual phone and email efforts in play today, should improve our overall operating margins.
Build Upon Strong Customer and Supplier Relationships to Expand Organically.
Our North American footprint and broad supplier relationships, combined with our regular interaction with our large and diverse customer base, provides us key insights and positions us to be a critical link in the supply chain for premium vaporization products and consumption accessories. Our suppliers benefit from access to thousands of brick and mortar retail locations as we are a single point of contact for improved production, planning and efficiency. Our customers, in turn, benefit from our market leadership, talented sales force, broad product offerings, high inventory availability, timely delivery and exceptional customer service. We believe our strong customer and supplier relationships will enable us to expand and broaden our market share in the premium vaporization products and consumption accessories marketplace and expand into new categories.
Pursue Value-Enhancing Strategic Acquisitions.
Through our acquisitions of VaporNation (Better Life Holdings, LLC), Pollen Gear LLC, and Conscious Wholesale, we have added new markets within the United States and Europe, new product lines, talented employees, and operational best practices. On March 2021, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Eyce, which further diversified our Greenlane Brand offerings through the integration of Eyce premium silicone smoking products and accessories. On November 30, 2021, we acquired DaVinci, which expanded our Greenlane Brands portfolio and intellectual property pipeline of premium portable vaporizers. Given our current stock price level, we have decided to temporarily pause our acquisition activity. Once our stock price increases to a level that we believe is sufficient for accretive acquisitions, we intend to resume these strategic acquisitions to grow our market share and enhance leadership positions by taking advantage of our scale, operational experience, and acquisition know-how to pursue and integrate attractive targets. We believe we have significant opportunities to add product categories through our knowledge of our industry and possible acquisition targets.
Be the Employer of Choice. 
We believe our employees are the key drivers of our success, and we aim to recruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry. Our size and scale enable us to offer structured training and career path opportunities for our employees, and within our sales and marketing teams, we have built an entrepreneurial culture that rewards performance. We are committed to being the employer of choice in our industry.
Business Seasonality
We have historically experienced only moderate seasonality in our Consumer Goods business, particularly during the fourth quarter, which coincides with Cyber Monday (the first Monday after Thanksgiving, when online retailers typically offer holiday discounts), and as our customers build up their inventories in anticipation of the holiday season and for which we have related promotional marketing campaigns. Our Industrial Goods business is generally not affected by seasonality. 
Human Capital Resources
As of March 28, 2023, we had 145 full-time employees. Approximately 127 were employed in the U.S., and 18 were employed in Europe. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage. 
As part of our 2022 Plan, we completed a series of reductions in force during 2022, which we expect to result in approximately $8.0 million in annualized cash compensation cost savings. We believe our current headcount and resources are sufficient to execute our plan of achieving profitability in the near-term, while remaining flexible to scale our hiring as industry demand and our sales grow. 
As we mention in our core operating strategies, we aim to be the employer of choice, as our employees are the key drivers of our success. We aim to recruit, train, promote and retain the most talented and success-driven personnel in the industry. Our industry knowledge and scale provide opportunities for our employees to obtain structured training and career path opportunities across all departments and positions. We are a company that operates with three core values: never settle, never follow, and never disrespect. 
Culture and Engagement
We exist to elevate all elements of the consumption experience. We are the driving force behind broadening accessibility to best-in-class ancillary products. We cultivate a passionate culture that empowers our team to thrive within our rapidly evolving industry. Our values are to: never settle, never follow, and never disrespect. We envision a world where humanity is free to enjoy mother nature’s magic, and we pledge that each of our employees will play an integral role in helping us make our vision a reality.
Everything we do is powered by our vision and core values and our culture reflects that. As a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled work force committed to our company. We send out regular employee engagement surveys, and in consultation with our employees we have addressed several opportunities to further improve our culture. By being open, honest, and transparent, our employees feel more actively engaged in our success. 
Total Rewards, Pay Equity and Retention
We strive to attract and retain diverse, high caliber employees who raise the talent bar by offering competitive compensation and benefit packages, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We regularly review and survey our compensation and benefit programs against the market to ensure we remain competitive in our hiring practices. We provide employee salaries that are competitive and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience, the location of their job and their performance. We also encourage, support, and compensate our employees based on our philosophy of 
recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance. We believe that performance and development is an ongoing process in which all employees should be active participants. Individual and company key performance goals are linked to employee compensation, and we have begun work on a Greenlane Learning and Development curriculum that will include a blended approach to both in person and virtual learning. 
Competition
Business-to-Business. We operate in an evolving industry in which the market and its participants remain highly fragmented. Although it is difficult to find reliable independent research, we believe there is a vast number of potential B2B customers in North America comprised of licensed cannabis dispensaries, smoke shops, and specialty retailers. Our B2B customers compete primarily on the basis of the breadth, style, quality, pricing and availability of merchandise, the level of customer service, brand recognition and loyalty. We successfully reach our B2B customers through our direct sales force and other marketing initiatives, and provide them with our strategically-curated mix of brands and products, merchandise planning strategies and exceptional customer service. Among vaporizer product distributors, we compete against both suppliers and other distributors. A number of suppliers choose to distribute directly in some sales channels and may also operate their own e-commerce platforms. We face competition from many small privately-owned regional distributors that carry a narrow range of products. We believe there are only a select few wholesale distributors carrying a complete line of premium vaporization products and consumption accessories. Also, in 2022 we launched our new enhanced wholesale shopping business through our business ("B2B") customer portal at Wholesale.Greenlane.com which provides our business customers seamless access to our catalog of products for purchase 24-hours a day, 365 days a year. The wholesale website gives customers an improved user experience that features an easy-to-use layout to streamline processes and allows customers to interact with us at their convenience.
Business-to-Consumer. A number of suppliers of vaporizers and specialized consumption products and accessories operate their own e-commerce websites through which they sell their items directly to end consumers. Additionally, there are hundreds of websites that sell products similar to those we offer in North America, Europe, Australia and other parts of the world. We believe we compete effectively with other e-commerce websites. Further, we provide fulfillment services to the owners of some of these websites as they do not carry their own inventory, are not able to ship as efficiently as we do and are unable to meet certain regulatory requirements, such as sales tax collection. Our primary e-commerce website, Vapor.com, ranks above many of our competitors' websites in various search engine categories. We believe our market knowledge, large product selection, relationships with vaporizer brands, in-house search engine optimization teams, social media focus and distribution facilities will enable us to remain a market leader in e-commerce.
Trademarks
We own a number of registered trademarks and service marks, including without limitation, trademarks in the relevant classes of goods for Greenlane, Higher Standards, Aerospaced, Groove, Pollen Gear, Eyce, and most recently DaVinci. We also license certain trademarks and other intellectual property, most notably those associated with our Marley Natural and Keith Haring brands. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Form 10-K may appear without the ® or TM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to these trademarks and trade names. In addition, this Form 10-K contains trade names, trademarks and service marks of other companies that we do not own. We do not intend our use or display of other companies’ trade names, trademarks or service marks to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, these other companies. We believe our largest trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. 
Regulatory Developments
Our operating results and prospects will be impacted, directly and indirectly, by regulatory developments at the local, state, and federal levels. Certain changes in local, state, national, and international laws and regulations, such as increased legalization of cannabis, create significant opportunities for our business. However, other changes to laws and regulations result in restrictions on which products we are permitted to sell and the manner in which we market our products, increased taxation of our products, and negative changes to the public perceptions of our products, among other effects.
We believe the continuing trend of states’ legalization of medicinal and adult-use cannabis is likely to contribute to an increase in the demand for many of our products. In the 2020 election, voters approved ballot initiatives legalizing adult-use cannabis in New Jersey, Arizona, Montana, and South Dakota. Voters also approved initiatives legalizing medical marijuana in Mississippi and South Dakota. In 2021, Connecticut and Virginia passed measures legalizing adult-use cannabis. In 2022, Maryland and Missouri passed legislation legalizing adult-use cannabis. Other states appear likely to legalize either medical or adult-use cannabis in 2023 and beyond. However, we can provide no assurances that additional states will legalize cannabis.
Recently, the identification of many cases of e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury (“EVALI”) has led to significant scrutiny of e-cigarette and other vaporization products. Additionally, certain academic studies and news reports have suggested that smoking or vaping may increase the risk of complications for individuals who contract COVID-19. EVALI, COVID-19, and other public health concerns could contribute to negative perceptions of vaping and smoking, which in turn could lead consumers to avoid certain of our products, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations.
In response to health concerns and concerns about people under the age of eighteen using vaping products, several localities, states, and the federal government have enacted measures restricting the sale of certain types of vaping products. For example, on December 20, 2019, legislation was signed into law that raised the federal minimum age of sale for tobacco products from 18 to 21. Additionally, the federal government, as well as some state, provincial, and local governments have enacted or plan to enact laws and regulations that restrict the sale of certain types of vaping products. For example, several states and localities have implemented bans on certain flavored vaping products in an effort to reduce the appeal of such products to minors and some localities have banned the sale of nicotine vaping products entirely. Other states, including Arkansas, Maine, Utah, and Vermont have banned the sale of vaporizers direct to consumers through mail. Other laws banning certain vaping products or restricting the manner in which they may be sold have been adopted in Arkansas, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Rhode Island, Vermont, Utah and Maine among other jurisdictions. Taken together, these federal, state, and provincial restrictions on vaping products materially and adversely affect our revenues. The ultimate impact of these policy developments will depend upon, among other things, the types and quantities of products we sell that are encompassed by each ban, the success of legal challenges to the bans, our suppliers' actions to adapt to actual and potential regulatory changes, and our ability to provide alternative products.
In addition, 30 states and the District of Columbia have recently adopted laws imposing taxes on vaping products. Additionally, as of 2022, at least 31 states have adopted laws imposing taxes on vaporizers. These taxes will result in increased prices to end consumers, which may adversely impact the demand for our products. We expect these taxes would impact our competitors similarly, assuming their compliance with applicable laws.
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020, contains provisions that prohibit the mailing of electronic nicotine delivery systems ("ENDS") through the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) and place certain regulatory requirements on shipment of ENDS through other carriers. Certain private carriers, including UPS and FedEx, also have policies restricting or prohibiting the shipment of many vaporization products we sell. On December 30, 2021, the USPS granted us an exception that permits Greenlane to continue shipping ENDS business to business via the USPS. This exception, combined with our use of alternative carriers, permits us to continue shipping almost all of our products to the vast majority of our customers, provided that we continue to meet all regulatory requirements. While we currently retain our ability to ship products to customers, additional legal or policy changes concerning the shipment of vaporizers could increase our costs materially and deprive us of our ability to timely deliver certain products to certain types of customers.
