History of Our Company



EUBG was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 21, 1999 under the name LE GOURMET CO, INC. Since EUBG’s inception, the Company had the following name changes: On March 17, 2003, to Estelle Reyna, Inc.; on September 11, 2003 to Karma Media, Inc.; on July 8, 2005 to Pitboss Entertainment, Inc.; on March 3, 2006 to US Energy Holdings, Inc.; on December 20, 2006 to Lonestar Group Holdings Company; on November 9, 2007 to Guardian Angel Group, Inc.; and on May 18, 2011 to REE International, Inc.; and on March 23, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Nevada Secretary of State amending Article I of its Articles of Incorporation changing the Company’s name to Entrepreneur Universe Bright Group, with an effective date of April 3, 2020.



Lonestar Group Holdings Company was a voluntary filer and filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on August 20, 2007.



In July 2018, XTC Inc. (“XTC”), one of EUBG’s shareholders, petitioned the Eight Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada (the “Court”), for appointment as custodian of the Company. On September 4, 2018, the Court granted XTC custodianship of the Company with the right to appoint officers and directors, negotiate and compromise debt, execute contracts, issue stock and authorize new classes of stock (the “Custodianship”).



Since the Form 15 filing on August 20, 2007 and prior to the Custodianship, the Company’s management believes that it was inactive with no business operations. In December 2018, XTC filed a Certificate of Revival for a revival of its charter, effective December 13, 2018, with the Nevada Secretary of State. XTC acted together with MXD Inc. (“MXD”) to revive the Company and to get current. MXD is a private company incorporated in the State of Colorado. As the president of XTC is also the president of MXD, the Company considered that the XTC and MXD are under common control.



XTC and MXD performed the following actions in its capacity as custodian:




● | Funded all expenses of the Company including paying off all outstanding liabilities discovered;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Brought the Company back in compliance with the Nevada Secretary of State, resident agent, transfer agent, OTC Markets Group;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Brought in and paid for accounting professionals as well as securities counsel.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




On December 18, 2018, the Company formed REE International, Inc. Colorado (“REE-CO”). On December 21, 2018, the Company entered into an Agreement for Divestiture of Assets to Subsidiary with REE-CO, where all of the Company’s assets, liabilities, and business were transferred to REE-CO. in exchange for 1,000 shares of REE-CO, and the Company became the parent company of REE-CO. Since then, the Company has no assets, liabilities and business.



On December 28, 2018, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with XTC to transfer 1,000 common shares of REE-CO to XTC at nil cash consideration (with XTC assuming all of the obligations and liabilities of REE-CO). Pursuant to the SPA, all the assets and liabilities previously reported in the Company’s financial statements were acquired by XTC and all the continuing obligations assumed were taken up by XTC. Since the closing of the SPA, REE-CO ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company on the same date., and the Company no longer had any assets, liabilities and business.



In consideration of the payments made to revive the Company and get current by the XTC and MXD, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to MXD on December 11, 2018 and issued 50,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to XTC on February 27, 2019, respectively.



On March 5, 2019, the total authorized common stock of the Company was increased to 1,800,000,000.



On April 24, 2019, XTC was discharged as custodian of the Company. Prior to the Custodianship and immediately before May 15, 2019, the Company has abandoned all of its business operations.

On May 15, 2019, 1,590,605,141 shares of the common stock was issued to MXD as consideration for its services to revive the Company and get current. On the same date, MXD and XTC agreed to voluntarily retire 1,000,000 Series A Preferred Stock and 50,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, respectively (the “Issuance”).



Immediately after the Issuance, MXD entered into certain Sale and Purchase Agreements, dated May 15, 2019 (the “Stock Purchase Agreements”), with Tethys Fountain Limited, New Finance Consultants Limited, Jia Wang, Jianyong Li, Haijun Jiang, Xuebin Wu and Fanfan Chen (collectively, the “Purchasers”), to transfer all its 1,590,605,141 shares of common stock of the Company to the Purchasers in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of $135,000. Upon the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreements, the Purchasers collectively owned 93.5% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, and Tethys Fountain Limited became the controlling shareholder of the Company.



On May 20, 2019, and as authorized by the Company’s board of directors, the Company began its current business as a marketing consulting company, as further described in the section entitled “Item 1. Business – Business Overview” below.



Corporate Structure



EUBG is a holding company for its operating subsidiaries. The operations of the Company’s PRC subsidiary, Xi’an Yunchuang Space Information Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly Entrepreneurship World Consultants Limited) in Xi’an, China are the primary operations of EUBG. Our PRC subsidiary is wholly-owned by the Company’s HK subsidiary, Entrepreneurship World Technology Holding Group Company Limited, a Hong Kong limited company. The HK Subsidiary was incorporated by the Company on May 15, 2019 with HK$10,000 as its registered capital as a holding company. The PRC subsidiary was incorporated on October 18, 2019 with HK$1,000,000 as its registered capital. On May 7, 2020, we incorporated Xian Yunchuang Space Information Technology Co., Ltd, BaiYin Branch (formerly Entrepreneurship World Consultants Limited, BaiYin Branch), with RMB900,000 as its registered capital, as a branch office of the PRC subsidiary in Baiyin City, Gansu Province, China.



While the Company’s major shareholders, headquarters, and operations are located in China, EUBG currently does not, and EUBG does not plan to use variable interest entities to execute our business plan or to conduct our China-based operations. EUBG is a Nevada holding company and does not have any substantive operations other than indirectly holding the equity interest in our operating subsidiaries in Hong Kong and China. Therefore, our shareholders will not directly hold any equity interests in our Chinese operating subsidiaries. Our holding company structure involves unique risks to investors. Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow our corporate structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the Company’s common stock, including that it could cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless.



We face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties related to being based in and having substantially all of our operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings, anti-monopoly regulatory actions, oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as the lack of PCAOB inspection on our auditors. Such risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the Company’s common stock or could significantly limit or completely hinder the Company’s ability to offer or continue to offer Stocks and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. See “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with doing business in China — “The recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company’s common stock, including potentially causing the value of the Company’s common stock to decline or be worthless; — Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us; — The PRC legal system is evolving, and the resulting uncertainties could adversely affect us; — The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Therefore, the Company’s susceptibility to such laws is unknown; — The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission or other PRC regulatory agencies may be required in connection with this registration under PRC law.”

The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene with or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. See “Risk Factors — Risks associated with doing business in China — Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us.” The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries such as the education and internet industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. Any such action, once taken by the PRC government, could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless.  See “Risk Factors — Risks Associated with doing business in China — The recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company’s common stock, including potentially causing the value of the Company’s common stock to decline or be worthless; — Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system, including uncertainties regarding the enforcement of laws, and sudden or unexpected changes in laws and regulations in China could adversely affect us and limit the legal protections available to you and us.”



The PRC laws and regulations and government policy changes rapidly on digital training. For our digital training related services, we worked with Beida Jade Bird Vocational Education (“Jade Bird”) which was an authorized licensee of China National Personal Talent Training Network (“CNPTTN”), a PRC regulatory agency for the talent training. Jade Bird was in charge of its training courses, and the Company was authorised by Jade Bird as its sole training related administrator of the training courses, limited to coordinate the digital training related services to individual clients who were interested in conducting live-broadcasting business through social medias. The Company provided training related services, to these individual clients who subscribed courses, in arranging the examination, following up certificate issuance processes, addressing clients’ concerns, etc. On March 22, 2022, the PRC subsidiary learned that Jade Bird suspended its service after receiving a notice from CNPTTN and that until further notice CNPTTN has suspended all recruitment services using its CNPTTN’s name. As a result of CNPTTN’s suspension, the PRC subsidiary has also suspended its digital training related services with Jade Bird from March 22, 2022 until further notice. In the future, laws and regulations and the CNPTTN may require our PRC Subsidiary to meet additional requirements or obtain additional approvals, licenses or permits to conduct KOL training related business. If our PRC Subsidiary is unable to meet the relevant requirements or obtain the relevant approvals, licenses or permits, our PRC Subsidiary may not be able to continue to conduct the KOL training related business. As of the date of this Annual Report, there is no further notice from CNPTTN and the service is still being suspended. Other than the above, we and our subsidiaries are currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC authorities to operate its principal business. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC government agencies would reach the same conclusion as we do. If (i) we inadvertently concluded that such permissions or approvals are not required, or (ii) the relevant regulatory PRC agencies later promulgate new rules requiring that we obtain their approvals to operate our business, and we are unable to obtain approval or a waiver of such approval requirements, any uncertainties and/or negative publicity regarding such an approval requirement could have a material adverse effect on our business operation and the trading price of our securities.



Although we concluded we and our subsidiaries are currently not required to obtain permission from any of the PRC central or local government and has not received any denial to list on the U.S. exchange or to conduct our business operation, if (x) we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required when they are, (y) we do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals if and when required, or (z) changes in applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations relating to our business or industry which would require us to obtain approvals in the future, our operations, financial conditions, and results of operations could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, and the value of the Company’s common stock could significantly decline or become worthless. See “Risk Factors —Risks related to our business and industry - Our PRC subsidiary may be required to obtain and maintain additional approvals, licenses or permits applicable to our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations” and “Risk Factors — Risks associated with doing business in China - The recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company’s common stock, including potentially causing the value of the Company’s common stock to decline or be worthless; - Uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations with respect to online platform business operation;”– The PRC legal system is evolving, and the resulting uncertainties could adversely affect us; – The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission or other PRC regulatory agencies may be required in connection with this registration under PRC law.”

EUBG is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or capital contribution to the HK subsidiary for its operations and the HK subsidiary is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or capital contribution to the PRC subsidiary for capital investment and company operations. For instance, the PRC subsidiary will use the cash for their daily business operations. However, under existing PRC regulations, any loans made to our PRC subsidiaries shall not exceed a statutory limit, and shall be filed with SAFE or its local bureau. Additionally, any capital contributions the HK subsidiary make to the PRC subsidiary shall be filed with the local commerce department. The PRC subsidiary is the main operating company to earn revenue. The HK subsidiary is also permitted under the laws of Hong Kong SAR to provide funding to EUBG through dividend distribution without restrictions on the amount of the funds. Current PRC laws require that dividends be paid only out of the profit for the year calculated according to PRC accounting principles, which differ from the generally accepted accounting principles in other jurisdictions. In addition, PRC laws also require a foreign-invested enterprise to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits, if any, to fund its statutory reserves, until the aggregate amount reaches 50% of its registered capital. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may, at its discretion, allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting principles to enterprise expansion funds, staff welfare, and bonus funds. Those reserve funds are not available for distribution as cash dividends. The PRC government’s control of foreign currency conversion may limit our foreign exchange transactions. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE. However, approval from SAFE, or registration with SAFE or other appropriate departments is required where RMB shall be converted into foreign currency and be remitted out of the PRC. Failure to comply with the above regulations may result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of foreign exchange controls.



As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary has distributed $7.1 million (net of withholding tax at $789,608 charged at a rate of 10% of the declared dividend) to its holding parent, which is our HK subsidiary. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with the above regulations in all respects in the future. If we fail to comply with the above regulations, our ability to transfer cash and distribute earnings may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business. Since EUBG, the Nevada holding company, is not the direct parent company of the PRC subsidiary, EUBG and the PRC subsidiary cannot make transfers to the other. We intend to keep any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business conducted by our subsidiaries, and we do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future from the HK subsidiary to EUBG, the Nevada holding company, and/or from EUBG to its shareholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, other than the above stated $7.1 million cash dividends transferred from our PRC subsidiary to our HK subsidiary for operational costs, no cash transfer or transfer of other assets (including dividends and distribution) have occurred among EUBG, our Nevada holding company, and either of its subsidiaries, our HK subsidiary or our PRC subsidiary. See “Summary of Risk Factors – Risks Related to Doing Business in the PRC” and “Risk Factors — Risks associated with doing business in China” for a detailed discussion of the Chinese legal restrictions on the payment of dividends, our ability to transfer cash within the Company and the potential for holders of the Company’s common stock to be subject to Chinese taxes on dividends paid by us in the event we are deemed a Chinese resident enterprise for Chinese tax purposes. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, total undistributed profits of the Company’s PRC subsidiary were $1,882,886 and $3,579,288, respectively. We have recognized deferred tax liabilities of $188,289 and $357,929, respectively, in respect of the undistributed profits. For more details, please refer to consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.



The PRC government has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and may intervene or influence our operations as the government deems appropriate to further regulatory, political and societal goals. To the extent that the cash and assets of our business are in our PRC subsidiary and/or Hong Kong subsidiary, such cash or assets may not be available to fund our operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong due to the potential intervention by the PRC government to impose restrictions and limitations over our ability or our subsidiaries’ ability to transfer cash or assets. Any such intervention in or influence on our business operations or action to exert more oversight and control over the cash or assets of our subsidiaries, once taken by the PRC government, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our common stock, or significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or in extreme cases, become worthless.  See “Risk Factors — Risks associated with doing business in China - The recent state government interference into business activities on U.S. listed Chinese companies may negatively impact our existing and future operations in China. The Chinese government may intervene in or influence our operations at any time, which could result in a material change in our operations and significantly and adversely impact the value of the Company’s common stock, including potentially causing the value of the Company’s common stock to decline or be worthless.”

On September 1, 2021, our PRC subsidiary and Hong Kong subsidiary adopted a written Monetary and Cash Fund Management System (“Cash Management Policy”) for its operations in China and Hong Kong. The Cash Management Policy covers cash, bank deposits and other monetary funds owned by the PRC subsidiary and Hong Kong subsidiary and includes procedures on receiving funds, depositing funds, transferring funds and proper documentation and recording of cash. We adopted the Cash Management Policy in order to provide a process and guidance on collecting, accounting for, and safeguarding all cash and cash equivalents of our PRC subsidiary and Hong Kong subsidiary, including 1) checking the latest regulation requirements between China and Hong Kong; and 2) seeking approval from EUBG’s chief executive officer in order to transfer funds from our PRC subsidiary to our HK subsidiary. EUBG does not have a cash management policy.



On December 16, 2021, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a report on its determinations that PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely PCAOB-registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), because of positions taken by PRC authorities in those jurisdictions. The PCAOB made these determinations pursuant to PCAOB Rule 6100, which provides a framework for how the PCAOB fulfills its responsibilities under the HFCAA. The report further listed in its Appendix A and Appendix B, Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Mainland China Determination and Registered Public Accounting Firms Subject to the Hong Kong Determination, respectively. On August 26, 2022, the PCAOB signed a Statement of Protocol with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, taking the first step toward opening access for the PCAOB to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB announced that it “was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate audit firms in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) for the first time in history, in 2022. Therefore, on December 15, 2022, the PCAOB Board voted to vacate previous determinations to the contrary.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, uncertainties exist with respect to the implementation of these provisions and there is no assurance that the PCAOB will be able to execute, in a timely manner, its future inspections and investigations in a manner that satisfies the Statement of Protocol. The audit report included in this registration statement for the year ended December 31, 2021 was issued by Centurion ZD CPA & Co. (“CZD CPA”), an audit firm headquartered in Hong Kong, a jurisdiction that the PCAOB has determined that the PCAOB is unable to conduct inspections or investigate auditors. CZD CPA is among those listed by the PCAOB Hong Kong Determination, a determination announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021 that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region and dependency of the PRC, because of a position taken by one or more authorities in Hong Kong. The lack of access to the PCAOB inspection in China prevents the PCAOB from fully evaluating audits and quality control procedures of the auditors based in China. As a result, the investors may be deprived of the benefits of such PCAOB inspections. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of these accounting firms’ audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to the PCAOB inspections. In addition, under the HFCAA (as amended by the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2023), our securities may be prohibited from trading on the U.S. stock exchanges or in the over the counter trading market in the U.S. if our auditor is not inspected by the PCAOB for two consecutive years, and this ultimately could result in the Company’s common stock being delisted. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (“AHFCAA”), which was enacted under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, as further described below. 



On April 22, 2022, the SEC provisionally identified EUBG as a company that has retained a registered public accounting firm to issue an audit report where that registered public accounting firm has a branch or office that (i) is located in a foreign jurisdiction and (ii) the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in that jurisdiction under the HFCAA (a “Commission-Identified Issuer”). On May 12, 2022, that provisional identification became conclusive and we are now subject to the requirements under the HFCAA, including the prohibition on the trading of such issuer’s securities on a national securities exchange or through any other method is within the SEC’s jurisdiction to regulate, including “over-the-counter” trading. This identification of EUBG as a Commission-Identified Issuer does not mean that we will be immediately prohibited from trading our securities on the OTC Pink Sheets. However, we may be prohibited from trading our securities, including trading in the “over-the-counter” market, if we continue to be unavailable for PCAOB inspection or investigation for two consecutive years under the HFCAA as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. In addition, after the first year of identification, we will be subject to new submission and disclosure requirements in our subsequent annual reports.

On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, was signed into law, which amended the HFCAA (i) to reduce the number of consecutive years that would trigger delisting from three years to two years, and (ii) so that any foreign jurisdiction could be the reason why the PCAOB does not to have complete access to inspect or investigate a company’s auditors. As it was originally enacted, the HFCAA applied only if the PCAOB’s inability to inspect or investigate because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction where the relevant public accounting firm is located. As a result of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, the HFCAA now also applies if the PCAOB’s inability to inspect or investigate the relevant accounting firm is due to a position taken by an authority in any foreign jurisdiction. The denying jurisdiction does not need to be where the accounting firm is located.



On September 7, 2022, the Company dismissed CZD CPA and appointed Prager Metis CPAs, LLC (“PragerMetis”) as the Company’s independent auditor for the fiscal year end December 31, 2022. Our current auditors, PragerMetis, is located at Hackensack, New Jersey, and has been inspected by the PCAOB.

Cash Transfer within our Organization



EUBG is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or capital contribution to the HK subsidiary for its operations and the HK subsidiary is permitted to transfer cash as a loan and/or capital contribution to the PRC subsidiary for capital investment and company operations. For instance, the PRC subsidiary will use the cash to pay for their daily business operations. The PRC subsidiary in China is the main operating company to earn revenue. However, under existing PRC regulations, any loans made to our PRC subsidiaries shall not exceed a statutory limit, and shall be filed with SAFE or its local bureau. Additionally, any capital contributions the HK subsidiary make to the PRC subsidiary shall be filed with the local commerce department.



Current investments in Chinese companies, which are governed by the Foreign Investment Law, and the dividends and distributions from our PRC subsidiary are subject to regulations and restrictions on dividends and payment to parties outside of China are subject to restrictions. The principal regulations governing the distribution of dividends paid by WFOEs include the Company Law of PRC, and the Foreign Investment Law. According to the Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China and its implementing rules, which jointly established the legal framework for the administration of foreign-invested companies, a foreign investor may, in accordance with other applicable laws, freely transfer into or out of China its contributions, profits, capital earnings, income from asset disposal, intellectual property rights, royalties acquired, compensation or indemnity legally obtained, and income from liquidation, made or derived within the territory of China in RMB or any foreign currency, and any entity or individual shall not illegally restrict such transfer in terms of the currency, amount and frequency. Under these regulations, our PRC subsidiary in China may pay dividends only out of its accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiary in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until its cumulative total reserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital. These reserve funds, however, may not be distributed as cash dividends. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal in the PRC, up to the amount of net assets held in each operating subsidiary. In contrast, there is presently no foreign exchange control or restrictions on capital flows into and out of Hong Kong. Hence, our Hong Kong subsidiary is able to transfer cash without any limitation to the United States under normal circumstances.



Renminbi, or RMB, is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our PRC subsidiary to use their potential future RMB revenues to pay dividends to us. The Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Shortages in availability of foreign currency may then restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to our offshore entities for those offshore entities to pay dividends or make other payments or otherwise to satisfy our foreign-currency-denominated obligations. RMB is currently convertible under the “current account,” which includes dividends and trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the “capital account,” which includes foreign direct investment and foreign debt (which may be denominated in foreign currency or RMB), including loans we may secure for our PRC subsidiary. Currently, our PRC subsidiary may purchase foreign currency for settlement of current account transactions, including payment of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China (SAFE) by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. The Chinese government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and additional restrictions and substantial vetting processes may be instituted by SAFE for cross-border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside of China or pay dividends in foreign currencies to holders of our securities. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, SAFE and other relevant Chinese governmental authorities. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for our subsidiaries. See the risk factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the Chinese legal restrictions on the payment of dividends, our ability to transfer cash within the Company and the potential for holders of the Company’s common stock to be subject to Chinese taxes on dividends paid by us in the event we are deemed a Chinese resident enterprise for Chinese tax purposes.





12







To address persistent capital outflows and the RMB’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar in the fourth quarter of 2016, the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, have implemented a series of capital control measures in the subsequent months, including stricter vetting procedures for China-based companies to remit foreign currency for overseas acquisitions, dividend payments and shareholder loan repayments. The PRC government may continue to strengthen its capital controls and our PRC subsidiary’s dividends and other distributions may be subject to tightened scrutiny in the future. The PRC government also imposes controls on the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies and the remittance of currencies out of the PRC. Therefore, we may experience difficulties in completing the administrative procedures necessary to obtain and remit foreign currency for the payment of dividends from our profits, if any. Furthermore, if the PRC subsidiary incurs debt on its own in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other payments.



In addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax at a rate of 10% will be applicable to dividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless reduced under treaties or arrangements between the PRC central government and the governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are tax resident. Pursuant to the tax agreement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the withholding tax rate in respect to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong Kong enterprise may be reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10%. However, if the relevant tax authorities determine that our transactions or arrangements are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the reduced 5% withholding rate will apply to dividends received by our Hong Kong subsidiary from our PRC subsidiary. This withholding tax will reduce the amount of dividends we may receive from our PRC subsidiary.



Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to HK subsidiary only out of its accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. However, we cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with the PRC regulations in all respects in the future. If we fail to comply with the PRC regulations, our ability to transfer cash and distribute earnings may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.



As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary distributed $7.1 million (net of withholding tax at $789,608 charged at a rate of 10% of the declared dividend) to its holding parent, the HK subsidiary. As long as meeting the above-mentioned requirements, there is no restriction or limitation to transfer dividends from our PRC subsidiary to its Hong Kong parent company, and there is no restriction or limitation to transfer dividends from our Hong Kong subsidiary to its US parent holding company. Since EUBG, the Nevada holding company, is not the direct parent company of the PRC subsidiary, EUBG and the PRC subsidiary cannot make transfer to the other. We intend to keep any future earnings to finance the expansion of our business to our subsidiaries, and we do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future from the HK subsidiary to EUBG, and/or from EUBG to its shareholders. As of the date of this Annual Report, other than the above stated $7.1 million cash dividends transferred from our PRC subsidiary to our HK subsidiary for operation costs, no cash transfer or transfer of other assets (including dividends and distribution) have occurred among our EUBG, our Nevada holding company and its subsidiaries, either the HK subsidiary or the PRC subsidiary. For more details for the withholding tax paid, see our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.

According to recent survey data conducted by ChiefMarketer, 75% of marketers adopt the strategy of online influencer marketing, and 43% of them plan to increase their investment in this area in 2019 (Source: ChiefMarketer, https://www.chiefmarketer.com/majority-marketers-use-influencers-survey/). Enterprises choose to cooperate with the brand and have a level of follower influence. The influencer then introduces and recommends those companies products to their followers through creative video content on a social media platform on a professional platform.



An influencer has an excellent ability to generate content, and enjoys creativity, content creation, and sharing audience. If influencers know their followers well, care about their feelings, and know what content to post, it is more effective for the followers. If the influencers and the client’s branding match accurately, the communication and cooperation between the two parties would work smoothly.



The word “influencer” as it is used in China is broad and applies to people who are bloggers, online content creators, vloggers and live streamers, as well as traditional celebrities. China has its own terminology to refer to an influencer marketing practitioner: key opinion leader (KOL) or “wang-hong,” which is the romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation for “online celebrity.”



Chinese users behave differently when it comes to taking advice. Instead of depending on search engines, Chinese users value advice from sources such as their peers, friends, bloggers and celebrities also known as KOL (Key Opinion Leaders). Much like influencers in the Western world, KOLs are very crucial in the overall digital marketing approach in China. An industry of “wang-hong incubators” or “KOL academies” is thriving to meet the flood of KOL aspirants. Currently, our PRC subsidiary cooperates with third party live-broadcasting training agencies to coordinate, recruit and enroll KOL students in various training programs in professional anchor quality. Such programs are able to qualify the trainees to obtain anchor licenses/permits before they broadcast on the internet.



In August 2020, our PRC subsidiary starts to cooperates with third party live-broadcasting training agencies to coordinate, recruit and enroll KOL students in various training programs in professional anchor quality. Such programs are able to qualify the trainees to obtain anchor licenses/permits before they broadcast on the internet. In this business, the third party live-broadcasting training agencies take the primarily responsibilities for providing the training programs to the KOL students. Our services are to these live-broadcasting training agencies, which include but not limit to, recruiting and enrolling KOL students and coordinating the schedule of training course teachers on behalf of the live-broadcasting training agencies. Our PRC subsidiary generated consultancy services income directly from the live-broadcasting agencies based on the number of successful enrolled KOL students recruited by us.



In September 2021, our PRC subsidiary starts to provide digital training related services to clients who are interested to conduct live-broadcasting business through social medias. We require the clients to pay a pre-established fee in exchange for the services. Revenues are recognized when promised services (e.g. preliminary consulting work, setting up of an e-learning account and delivery of learning materials) are delivered to the clients.



However, on March 22, 2022, our PRC subsidiary learned that Beijing Jade Bird Culture and Art Research Institute (“Jade Bird”), the KOL agency that the PRC subsidiary works with to coordinate digital training related service, suspended its service after receiving a notice from China National Personal Talent Training Network (“CNPTTN”), a PRC regulatory agency for the talent training, that until further notice. CNPTTN has suspended all recruitment services using its CNPTTN’s name. As a result of CNPTTN’s suspension, the PRC subsidiary has also suspended its digital training related services with Jade Bird from March 22, 2022 until further notice. Jade Bird is an authorized licensee of CNPTTN. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the digital training related services with Jade Bird represented 7.5% and 20.9% of our total revenue, or $262,799 and $1,176,515, respectively.



The future plan of our KOL Training Related Services will include: Individual KOL training – providing training sites, positioning KOLs individually according to their personality and appearance, languages and body languages training, one-on-one contents operation training, IP packaging, and their channel operation supporting. We also work with our clients to provide the training classes in training their own potential KOL candidates.



For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we generated $264,026 and $1,261,159, respectively, from the KOL Training Related Services, represented 7.5% and 22.4% of our total revenue.

Our Strategy



We, through our PRC subsidiary, has extensive experience with the “Chuangyetianxia” Platform that allow us to provide marketing consulting services to our customers leveraging the Platform to quickly increase customer traffic to our client’s products and services. We consider Xi’an CNT a related party as it is substantially owned and controlled by the wife and relatives of Mr. Tao Guolin, our chairman, executive officer and majority shareholder.



We also cooperate with third party live-broadcasting training agencies to coordinate, recruit and enroll KOL students in various training programs in professional anchor quality.



Our business objective is to generate revenues based on providing our digital marketing consultation and to maintain and grow ultimate user group for our clients.



Our target market is the start-up and small-size companies mainly situation in China which needs to upgrade their traditional marketing plan to digital marketing and establishing their brand names and exploit products market in the digital world and specified target audiences.



We seek to leverage our marketing management’s experience to expand our consumer base, starting with start-ups and small-size corporate clients. Our customers are from different market sectors including but not limited to online education, biotechnology, health care products, and agriculture technology products.



Potential competitors 



Our China subsidiary is operating in a highly competitive consulting market, from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our main competitors include: Soplan (索象), Han-Consulting (汉哲), Osens (欧赛斯)，Bayii (倍壹), Huayuhua (华与华)，SEMTIME, and Caina (采纳).



However, to our knowledge, none of these consulting companies are providing the services that integrates customers’ APPS to other APP platform likes we do. We provide our marketing consultation services to our customers by introducing and assisting them with integrating their APPs with and into the Chuangyetianxia. We leverage Chuangyetianxia Platform and active users to save the time and efforts of our customers to build up their own users base. Our customers are able to attract traffic to their APPs by simply applying and adapting to Chuangyetianxia Platform. In addition, Xi’an CNT is able to generate more traffic from the existing users of our customers. This model that we created is a win-win solution for our customers and to Xi’an CNT.



Those competitors are not using the methods to connect different APPs together to bring cross-traffics to each other’s platforms. Though we believe that we are the pioneer in using this strategy, these competitors may adopt the same method for their clients.



Our Challenges with Having Operations in China



Entrepreneur Universe Bright Group is a Nevada holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations and business in China through its PRC subsidiary. Such structure involves unique risks to investors in the Company’s common stock. For a detailed description of the risk, see “Risk Factors”, including the risks described under the subsections headed “Risks Related to Our Business and Industry”, “Risks associated with doing business in China” and “Risks Related to the Market for the Company’s Common Stock”. In particular, as we are a China-based company incorporated in Nevada, we face various legal and operational risks and uncertainties related to being based in and having substantially all of our operations in China. The PRC government has significant authority to exert influence on the ability of a China-based company, such as us, to conduct its business, accept foreign investments or list on an U.S. or other foreign exchanges. For example, we face risks associated with regulatory approvals of offshore offerings, anti-monopoly regulatory actions, oversight on cybersecurity and data privacy, as well as the lack of PCAOB inspection on our auditors. Such risks could result in a material change in our operations and/or the value of the Company’s common stock or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer the Company’s common stock and/or other securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. The PRC government also has significant oversight and discretion over the conduct of our business and our operations may be affected by evolving regulatory policies as a result. The PRC government has recently published new policies that significantly affected certain industries, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it will in the future release regulations or policies regarding our industry that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the PRC government has recently indicated an intent to exert more oversight and control over overseas securities offerings and other capital markets activities and foreign investment in China-based companies like us. These risks could result in a material change in our operations and the value of the Company’s common stock, or could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or become worthless. You should pay special attention to the subsection headed “Risks associated with doing business in China” below.

Key Factors that Affect Operating Results



We believe the following key factors may affect our financial condition and results of operations: 



Our success depends on our ability to acquire clients effectively



Our ability to increase our revenue largely depends on our ability to attract and engage potential clients. Our sales and marketing efforts include those related to client acquisition and retention, and general marketing. We intend to continue to dedicate significant resources to our sales and marketing efforts and constantly seek to improve the effectiveness of these efforts to grow our revenues.



Our client acquisition channels primarily include our sales and marketing campaigns and existing client referrals. In order to acquire clients, we have made significant efforts in building mutually beneficial long-term relationships with local government and local business associations. In addition, we also market our services through the influence of our founder and CEO, Mr. Guolin Tao, who is a well-known entrepreneur in China. If any of our current client acquisition channels becomes less effective, or if we are unable to continue to use any of these channels, we may not be able to attract new clients in a cost-effective manner or convert potential clients into active clients and may even lose our existing clients to our competitors. To the extent that our current client acquisition and retention efforts becomes less effective, our service revenue may be significantly impacted, which would have a significant adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition and results of operations.



Our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 depends on one major customer



For the year ended December 31, 2022, the customer for our PRC subsidiary that constitutes a greater-than ten percent (10%) contribution to net revenues is Zhongchuang Boli Technology Holdings Co., Ltd (47%) who is a marketplace operator conducting both agency-based sourcing services and digital marketing services with our PRC subsidiary.



For agency-based sourcing services, it represents product procurement on behalf of the customer. We recognized revenues from agency-based sourcing at a fixed rate on the value of goods that are sourced and delivered to the ultimate customers by the customer. The service agreements is renewed every year.



For Digital marketing services, we help the customer to promote designated products or services through social medial influencers engaged by the customer. We are entitled to a fixed rate on the revenue generated by the customer that are related to the designated products or services. The duration of this service agreement is 3 years. No renewal term is included in the agreement as this will be determined by our management on a case-by-case basis.



The customer is required to settle the service fees in accordance with the predetermined settlement period (e.g. weekly) in accordance with the service agreements.



There is a risk to our revenue in case the major customer decided to terminate the services with us which will significantly harm our business.



A severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition.



The rapid growth of the Chinese economy has slowed down since 2012 and such slowdown may continue in the future. There is considerable uncertainty over the trade conflicts between the United States and China and the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world’s leading economies, including the United States and China; the withdrawal of these expansionary monetary and fiscal policies could lead to a contraction. There continue to be concerns over unrest and terrorist threats in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in oil and other markets. There are also concerns about the relationship among China and other Asian countries, which may result in or intensify potential conflicts in relation to territorial disputes. The eruption of armed conflict could adversely affect global or Chinese discretionary spending, either of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operation in financial condition. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall economic growth rate in China. Any severe or prolonged slowdown in the global or Chinese economy would likely materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, continued turbulence in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access capital markets to meet liquidity needs.

Our services depend on our ability to retain our cooperation with Xi’an CNT



A significant portion of our PRC subsidiary’s revenues are generated from our PRC subsidiary’s marketing consulting services that relies on an e-commerce APP known as “Chuangyetianxia”. The APP is developed by our related company, Xi’an CNT, which offers a range of capabilities that connects sellers with buyers, for example wholesale companies and the end customers. It offers users an interface to the supplier’s services/product catalogues.



Through our PRC subsidiary’s prior working relationship with Xi’an CNT and our extensive experience with the Platform, we are able to provide our customers with customized service and seamless integration of our customers’ APP to the Platform and assisting them in connecting with the Platform and assisting them in achieving a specific business objective (e.g. end customer placed an order to buy a product or enroll a course). We are entitled to a fixed rate on revenue generated by our client that are related to the scope of respective consultancy services upon client acceptance on the services provided.



In addition, we, through our PRC subsidiary, also provide agency-based sourcing and digital marketing services to connect marketplace operators and merchants. Agency-based sourcing services represents product procurement on behalf of the Platform. We recognize revenues from agency-based sourcing at a fixed rate on the value of goods that are sourced and delivered to the ultimate customers by the merchants. Digital marketing services are provided to the Platform to promote designated products or services through social medial influencers engaged by us. We are entitled to a fixed rate on the revenue generated by the Platform that are related to the designated products or services.



For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we derived services revenues of $1,981,096 and $4,152,617, respectively, through the APP platform, represented 56.5% and 73.7% of our total revenue. In case Xi’an CNT suspends the Platform, or the normal operation of the Platform is disrupted, or our customers are denied access to the Platform, our revenue will be significantly affected.



The impact from COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition.



In early January of 2020, a novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak took place in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, it has spread rapidly to Asia and other parts of the world. The COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in widespread economic disruptions in China, as well as stringent government measures by the Chinese government to contain its transmissions including quarantines, travel restrictions, and temporary closures of non-essential businesses in China and elsewhere.



At the end of 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak in China appears to be generally under control and business activities have recovered on the whole. The outbreak became more stabilized in China and other regions in the world. However, sporadic cases continue to be found during the first half year of 2021 in China. In the second quarter of 2021, a new Delta variant of COVID-19 had been found in certain cities in China, which cause another outbreak, thus increasing risks and possible further disruption to businesses. Therefore, certain of our consulting services were suspended from April 2021 to August 2021. We have resumed these consulting businesses from August 2021 in order to maintain diversified services for our customers.



As of December 31, 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. Although vaccines are now being distributed and administered across many parts of the world, new variants of the virus have emerged and may continue to emerge that have shown to be more contagious. We continue to adhere to applicable governmental and commercial restrictions and to work to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, customers, communities, liquidity and financial position. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak may impact the company’s business, operations and financial results from this point forward will depend on numerous evolving factors that the company cannot accurately predict. Those factors include the following: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals’ actions in response to the pandemic in the future; and any other further development of the COVID-19 outbreak.



Substantially all of the Company’s revenues and operations are concentrated in China. Consequently, our results of operations and financial performances have been affected since 2020 and into 2022. Due to widespread economic disruptions during the outbreak, demand for the Company’s consulting services by small and medium-sized enterprises were also adversely affected. Specifically, as a result of government mandated closures of non-essential business in China, many of the Company’s customers’ business were suspended while others permanently closed their businesses, which has had an adverse impact on our business and financial condition and has hampered our ability to generate revenue and access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable terms.

Holding Company Structure



Entrepreneur Universe Bright Group is a Nevada holding corporation and we conduct substantially all of our operations through our Hong Kong and PRC subsidiary. As a result, our ability to pay dividends and to service any debt we may incur overseas largely depends upon dividends paid by our PRC subsidiary. If our PRC subsidiary incurs debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. 



In addition, our PRC subsidiary is permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprise as promulgated by the Ministry of Finance of the PRC, or the PRC GAAP. The aggregate distributable retained earnings for our PRC subsidiary as determined under the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprise were RMB14 million and RMB24 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Pursuant to the laws and regulations applicable to China’s foreign investment enterprises, our subsidiary that is foreign investment enterprise in the PRC has to make appropriation from their after-tax profit, as determined under PRC GAAP, to reserve funds including (i) general reserve fund, (ii) enterprise expansion fund and (iii) staff bonus and welfare fund. The appropriation to the general reserve fund must be at least 10% of the after-tax profits calculated in accordance with PRC GAAP. Appropriation is not required if the reserve fund has reached 50% of the registered capital of our subsidiary. As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary has contributed 50% of the registered capital to general reserve fund. Appropriation to the other two reserve funds are at our subsidiary’s discretion. Our PRC subsidiaries did not make any contributions to the enterprise expansion fund or the staff and bonus welfare fund during each period presented. The restricted amounts of our PRC subsidiary totaled RMB457,499 (US$65,911) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. See “Governmental Regulation in relation to Company’s business - Regulations related to Dividend Distribution”.



As of the date of this Annual Return, our PRC subsidiary, distributed USD7.1 million (net of withhold tax at USD789,608 charged at a rate of 10% of the declared dividend) to its holding parent Hong Kong subsidiary. As long as meeting the above-mentioned requirements, there is no restriction or limitation to transfer dividends for our China subsidiary to its Hong Kong parent company, and there is no restriction or limitation to transfer dividends for our Hong Kong subsidiary to its US parent holding company.



Recent Regulatory Developments



Regulations on Overseas Listings



On July 6, 2021, Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law was jointly issued by the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council, which stepped up scrutiny of overseas listings by companies and calls for strengthening cooperation in cross-border regulation, improving relevant laws and regulations on cyber security, cross-border data transmission and confidential information management, including the confidentiality requirement and file management related to the issuance and listing of securities overseas, enforcing the primary responsibility of the enterprises for information security of China-based overseas-listed companies and promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems to deal with the risks and incidents faced by China-based overseas-listed companies.



On February 17, 2023, the CSRC promulgated the Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic (the “Overseas Listing Trial Measures”) and five supporting guidelines, which will become effective on March 31, 2023. Pursuant to the Overseas Listing Trial Measures, PRC domestic companies that directly or indirectly offer or list their securities in an overseas market, which include (i) any PRC company limited by shares, and (ii) any offshore company that conducts its business operations primarily in China and contemplates to offer or list its securities in an overseas market based on its onshore equities, assets or similar interests, are required to file with the CSRC within three business days after its application for overseas listing is submitted. Furthermore, if any PRC company that has directly or indirectly listed securities in overseas markets conducts follow-on offering of securities in such overseas markets, it shall fulfill the filing procedures with and report relevant information to the CSRC, too. Failure to complete the filing under the Overseas Listing Trial Measures may subject a PRC domestic company to rectification ordered by the CSRC, warning, and fine of RMB1 million to RMB10 million. In addition, PRC domestic companies shall report to the CSRC upon occurrence of certain material events, including change of control, investigations or sanctions imposed by overseas securities regulatory authorities, change of listing status or transfer of listing segment, and voluntary or mandatory delisting.

Licenses, Permits and Government Regulations



PRC Legal System



The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on the PRC Constitution and is made up of written laws, regulations and directives. Unlike in the US where the law built partly upon decisions of common law cases, court cases in the PRC do not constitute binding precedents. The governmental directives are organized in the following hierarchy.



The National People’s Congress of the PRC (“NPC”) and the Standing Committee of the NPC are empowered by the PRC Constitution to exercise the legislative power of the state. The NPC has the power to amend the PRC Constitution and to enact and amend primary laws governing the state organs and civil and criminal matters. The Standing Committee of the NPC is empowered to interpret, enact and amend laws other than those required to be enacted by the NPC.



The State Council of the PRC is the highest organ of state administration and has the power to enact administrative rules and regulations. Ministries and commissions under the State Council of the PRC are also vested with the power to issue orders, directives and regulations within the jurisdiction of their respective departments. Administrative rules, regulations, directives and orders promulgated by the State Council and its ministries and commissions must not be in conflict with the PRC Constitution or the national laws and, in the event that any conflict arises, the Standing Committee of the NPC has the power to annul such administrative rules, regulations, directives and orders.



At the regional level, the people’s congresses of provinces and municipalities and their standing committees may enact local rules and regulations and the people’s government may promulgate administrative rules and directives applicable to their own administrative area. These local laws and regulations may not be in conflict with the PRC Constitution, any national laws or any administrative rules and regulations promulgated by the State Council.



Rules, regulations or directives may be enacted or issued at the provincial or municipal level or by the State Council of the PRC or its ministries and commissions in the first instance for experimental purposes. After sufficient experience has been gained, the State Council may submit legislative proposals to be considered by the NPC or the Standing Committee of the NPC for enactment at the national level.



Governmental Regulations in Relation to our Businesses



This section set forth a summary of the principal PRC laws and regulations relevant to our business and operations in China.



Cybersecurity Measures



On December 28, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China published the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), which became effective on February 15, 2022 and replace the current Measures for Cybersecurity Review promulgated on April 13, 2020. The Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) specifies that the procurement of network products and services by operator of critical information infrastructure and the activities of data process carried out by Internet platform operator that raise or may raise “national security” concerns are subject to strict cyber security review by Cybersecurity Review Office established by the CAC. Before a critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services, it should assess the potential risk of national security that may be caused by the use of such products and services. If such use of products and services may give raise to national security concerns, it should apply for a cyber security review by the Cybersecurity Review Office and a report of analysis of the potential effect on national security shall be submitted when the application is made. In addition, Internet platform operators that possess the personal data of over one million users must apply for a review by the Cybersecurity Review Office, if they plan to list their companies in foreign countries. The CAC may voluntarily conduct cyber security review if any network products and services and activities of data process affects or may affect national security. It may take approximately 70 business days in maximum for the general cybersecurity review upon the delivery of their applications, which may be subject to extensions for a special review. We will not be subject to cybersecurity review with the CAC under the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), on the basis that (i) we currently do not have over one million users’ personal information and do not anticipate that we will be collecting over one million users’ personal information in the foreseeable future, which we understand might otherwise subject us to the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021); (ii) our PRC subsidiary’s business operations do not involve any Critical Information Infrastructure, and (iii) neither we nor the PRC subsidiary has received any notification from applicable PRC governmental authorities indicating that any of the PRC subsidiary’s products or services is determined as the Critical Information Infrastructure.





20







In addition, on November 14, 2021, the Administration Regulations on Cyber Data Security (Draft for Comments) (《网络数据安全管理条例（征求意见稿）》 ) (the “Draft Regulation”) was proposed by the CAC for public comments until December 13, 2021. The Draft Regulation stipulates that data processors which process the personal information of at least one million users must apply for a cybersecurity review if they plan to list their companies in foreign countries, and the Draft Regulation further require the data processors that carry out the following activities to apply for cybersecurity review in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations: (i) the merger, reorganization or division of internet platform operators that have gathered a large number of data resources related to national security, economic development and public interests affects or may affect national security; (ii) the listing of the data processor in Hong Kong affects or may affect the national security; and (iii) other data processing activities that affect or may affect national security. Any failure to comply with such requirements may subject us to, among others, suspension of services, fines, revoking relevant business permits or business licenses and penalties. Since the CAC is still seeking comments on the Draft Regulation from the public as of the date of the Annual Report, the Draft Regulation (especially its operative provisions) and its anticipated adoption or effective date are subject to further changes with substantial uncertainty. 



As the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) and the Draft Regulation are newly published, the exact scope of “critical information infrastructure operators” and “data processing operators” under the draft measures and the current regulatory regime remains unclear, and the PRC government authorities may have wide discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these laws. Currently, the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021) and the Draft Regulation have not materially affected our business and operations, but in anticipation of the strengthened implementation of cybersecurity laws and regulations and the continued expansion of our business, our PRC subsidiary faces potential risks if we are deemed as a critical information infrastructure operator or data processing operator under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations. In such case, we must fulfill certain obligations as required under the PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, including, among others, storing personal information and other important data collected and produced within the PRC territory as part of our operations in China (as we currently do in our operations), and we may be subject to lengthy cybersecurity review and other enhanced regulatory requirements when purchasing internet products and services or conducting data processing activities. We may face challenges in addressing such enhanced regulatory requirements and make necessary changes to our internal policies and practices in data privacy and cybersecurity matters. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Industry — Our PRC subsidiary may be liable for improper collection, use or appropriation of personal information provided by our customers and employees ” and “Risk Factors — Risks associated with doing business in China — Uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations with respect to online platform business operation.”



As of the date of this filing of the Annual Report, our operating subsidiaries have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by the Cyberspace Administration of China based on the draft measures, and we have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, sanctions in such respect or any regulatory objections to this registration. As of the date of this Annual Report, recent regulatory actions by China’s government related to data security have not materially impacted our ability to conduct our business, accept foreign investments or list on a U.S. or other foreign exchanges.



Regulations Related to Foreign Investment



Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment



Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Guidance Catalog, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, and the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC. The Guidance Catalog lays out the basic framework for foreign investment in China, classifying businesses into three categories with regard to foreign investment: “encourage,” “restricted” and “prohibited.” Industries not listed in the catalog are generally deemed as falling into a fourth category “permitted” unless specifically restricted by other PRC laws.



In addition, in June 2018 the MOFCOM and the NDRC promulgated the Special Management Measures (Negative List) for the Access of Foreign Investment, or the Negative List, which became effective on July 28, 2018 and was further updated on June 30, 2019 and June 23, 2020.





21







Foreign Investment Law



On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, or the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law of the PRC, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The organization form, organization and activities of foreign-invested enterprises shall be governed, among others, by the PRC Company Law and the PRC Partnership Enterprise Law. Foreign-invested enterprises established before the implementation of the Foreign Investment Law may retain the original business organization and so on within five years after the implementation of this Law.



The Foreign Investment Law is formulated to further expand opening-up, vigorously promote foreign investment and protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors. According to the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investments are entitled to pre-entry national treatment and are subject to negative list management system. The pre-entry national treatment means that the treatment given to foreign investors and their investments at the stage of investment access shall not be less favorable than that of domestic investors and their investments. The negative list management system means that the state implements special administrative measures for access of foreign investment in specific fields.



Foreign investors’ investment, earnings and other legitimate rights and interests within the territory of China shall be protected in accordance with the law, and all national policies on supporting the development of enterprises shall equally apply to foreign-invested enterprises. Among others, the state guarantees that foreign-invested enterprises participate in the formulation of standards in an equal manner and that foreign-invested enterprises participate in government procurement activities through fair competition in accordance with the law. Further, the state shall not expropriate any foreign investment except under special circumstances. In special circumstances, the state may levy or expropriate the investment of foreign investors in accordance with the law for the needs of the public interest. The expropriation and requisition shall be conducted in accordance with legal procedures and timely and reasonable compensation shall be given. In carrying out business activities, foreign-invested enterprises shall comply with relevant provisions on labor protection. 



The Implementation Regulations of Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, adopted by the State Council on December 26, 2019 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides implementing measures and detailed rules to ensure the effective implementation of the Foreign Investment Law.



Regulations Related to Mobile Internet Applications Information Services



Mobile Internet applications and application stores are specifically regulated by the Administrative Provisions on Mobile Internet Applications Information Services, or the App Provisions, which were promulgated by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC, on June 28, 2016, and became effective on August 1, 2016. Pursuant to the App Provisions, application information service providers shall obtain the relevant qualifications prescribed by laws and regulations, strictly implement their information security management responsibilities and carry out certain duties, including establishing and completing user information security protection mechanism and information content inspection and management mechanisms, protect users’ right to know and to choose in the process of usage, and to record and preserve users’ daily usage information for at least 60 days. Furthermore, internet application store service providers and internet application information service providers shall sign service agreements to determinate both sides’ rights and obligations.



In addition, on December 16, 2016, the MIIT promulgated the Interim Measures on the Administration of Pre-Installation and Distribution of Applications for Mobile Smart Terminals, or the App Interim Measures, which took effect on July 1, 2017. The App Interim Measures requires, among others, that internet information service providers must ensure that a mobile application, as well as its ancillary resource files, configuration files and user data can be uninstalled by a user on a convenient basis, unless it is a basic function software, which refers to a software that supports the normal functioning of hardware and operating system of a mobile smart device.



Neither the App Provisions nor the App Interim Measures, however, has further clarified the scope of “information services,” neither do they specify what “relevant qualification(s)” that an app owner/operator must obtain. In practice, operational activities of a company conducted through an app is currently subject to the supervisions of local departments of the Information Communications Administration, and often, the local departments differentiate the operational activities conducted through websites and through apps.



As of date of the Annual Report, we have not received any inquiry or notice from the PRC government concerning our compliance of such regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with ours.

Regulations Related to Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs



On April 13, 2005, the State Council promulgated the Certain Decisions on the Entry of the Non-state-owned Capital into the Cultural Industry. On July 6, 2005, five PRC governmental authorities, including the Ministry of Culture, or the MOC, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, or the SARFT (the predecessor of the National Radio and Television Administration, or NRTA), the General Administration of Press and Publication, or the GAPP, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC and the MOFCOM, jointly adopted the Several Opinions on Canvassing Foreign Investment into the Cultural Sector. Under these provisions, non-state owned capital and foreign investors are prohibited from engaging in the business of distributing audio-visual programs through information networks.



To further regulate the provision of audio-visual program services to the public via the internet, including through mobile networks, within the territory of the PRC, the SARFT and the MIIT jointly promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Audio-Visual Program Service, or the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, on December 20, 2007, which took effect on January 31, 2008 and subsequently amended on August 28, 2015. Pursuant to the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, Internet audio-visual program services refer to activities of making, redacting and integrating audio-visual programs, providing them to the general public via the Internet, and providing platforms for uploading and spreading audio-visual programs. Providers of internet audio-visual program services are required to obtain the Audio-Visual License issued by SARFT, or complete certain registration procedures with SARFT. In general, providers of internet audio-visual program services must be either state-owned or state-controlled entities, and the business to be carried out by such providers must satisfy the overall planning and guidance catalog for internet audio-visual program service determined by SARFT. Our subsidiaries is neither state-owned nor state-controlled, therefore it is unlikely that it will be able to obtain the Audio-Visual License if required to do so. Whoever engages in Internet audio-visual program service without the license or registration, the competent authorities shall give it/him an admonition and order it/him to correct, and may impose a fine of not more than RMB30,000 (approximately US$4,348); if the circumstances are serious, a punishment shall be imposed in accordance with the provision of Article 47 of the Radio and Television Administration Regulation.



On May 21, 2008, SARFT issued a Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Application and Approval of License for the Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, as amended on August 28, 2015, which further set out detailed provisions concerning the application and approval process regarding the Audio-Visual License. Further, on March 31, 2009, SARFT promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of the Content of Internet Audio-Visual Programs, which reiterates the pre-approval requirements for the audio-visual programs transmitted via the internet, including through mobile networks, where applicable, and prohibits certain types of internet audio-visual programs containing violence, pornography, gambling, terrorism, superstition or other similarly prohibited elements.



On March 17, 2010, the SARFT issued the Internet Audio-visual Program Services Categories (Provisional), or the Provisional Categories, as amended on March 10, 2017. According to the Provisional Categories, there are four categories of internet audio-visual program services which are further divided into seventeen sub-categories. The third sub-category to the second category covers the making and editing of certain specialized audio-visual programs concerning, among other things, finance and educational content, and broadcasting such content to the general public online. However, there are still significant uncertainties relating to the interpretation and implementation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions, in particular, the scope of “internet audio-visual programs”.



In addition, the Notice concerning Strengthening the Administration of the Streaming Service of Online Audio-Visual Programs promulgated by the State Administration of Press and Publication Radio, Film and Television, or the SAPPRFT (the predecessor of NRTA) on September 2, 2016 emphasizes that, unless a specific license is granted, audio-visual programs service provider is forbidden from engaging in live streaming on major political, military, economic, social, cultural and sports events. On November 4, 2016, the State Internet Information Office promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Internet Live-Streaming Services, or Internet Live-Streaming Services Provisions, which came into effect on December 1, 2016. According to the Internet Live-Streaming Services Provisions, an internet live-streaming service provider shall (a) establish a live-streaming content review platform; (b) conduct authentication registration of internet live-streaming issuers based on their identity certificates, business licenses and organization code certificates; and (c) enter into a service agreement with internet live-streaming services user to specify both parties’ rights and obligations.



On March 16, 2018, the SAPPRFT issued the Notice on Further Regulating the Transmission Order of Internet Audio-Visual Programs, which requires that, among others, audio-visual platforms shall: (i) not produce or transmit programs intended to parody or denigrate classic works, (ii) not re-edit, re-dub, re-caption or otherwise.



As of date of the Annual Report, we have not received any inquiry or notice from the PRC government concerning our compliance of such regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with ours.

Regulation on Information Protection on Networks



On December 28, 2012, SCNPC issued Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Strengthening Information Protection on Networks, pursuant to which network service providers and other enterprises and institutions shall, when gathering and using electronic personal information of citizens in business activities, publish their collection and use rules and adhere to the principles of legality, rationality and necessarily, explicitly state the purposes, manners and scopes of collecting and using information, and obtain the consent of those from whom information is collected, and shall not collect and use information in violation of laws and regulations and the agreement between both sides; and the network service providers and other enterprises and institutions and their personnel must strictly keep such information confidential and may not divulge, alter, damage, sell, or illegally provide others with such information.



On July 16, 2013, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, issued the Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunication and Internet User, which was effective as of September 1, 2013. The requirements under this order are stricter and wider compared to the above decision issued by the National People’s Congress. According to the provisions, if a network service provider wishes to collect or use personal information, it may do so only if such collection is necessary for the services it provides. Furthermore, it must disclose to its users the purpose, method and scope of any such collection or usage, and must obtain consent from the users whose information is being collected or used. Network service providers are also required to establish and publish their protocols relating to personal information collection or usage, keep any collected information strictly confidential and take technological and other measures to maintain the security of such information. Network service providers are required to cease any collection or usage of the relevant personal information, and provide services for the users to de-register the relevant user account, when a user stops using the relevant Internet service. Network service providers are further prohibited from divulging, distorting or destroying any such personal information, or selling or providing such personal information unlawfully to other parties. In addition, if a network service provider appoints an agent to undertake any marketing or technical services that involve the collection or usage of personal information, the network service provider is required to supervise and manage the protection of the information. The provisions state, in broad terms, that violators may face warnings, fines, public exposure and, criminal liability whereas the case constitutes a crime.



On June 1, 2017, the Cybersecurity Law of the PRC promulgated in November, 2016 by SCNPC became effective. This law also absorbed and restated the principles and requirements mentioned in the aforesaid decision and order, and further provides that, where an individual finds any network operator collects or uses his or her personal information in violation of the provisions of any law, regulation or the agreement of both parties, the individual shall be entitled to request the network operator to delete his or her personal information; if the individual finds that his or her personal information collected or stored by the network operator has any error, he or she shall be entitled to request the network operator to make corrections, and the network operator shall take measures to do so. Pursuant to this law, the violators may be subject to: (i) warning; (ii) confiscation of illegal gains and fines equal to one to ten times of the illegal gains; or if without illegal gains, fines up to RMB1,000,000; or (iii) an order to shut down the website, suspend the business operation for rectification, or revoke the business license. In addition, responsible persons may be subject to fines between RMB10,000 and RMB100,000.



On August 31, 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the E-commerce Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2019. The E-commerce Law imposes a series of requirements on e-commerce operators including e-commerce platform operators, merchants operating on the platform and the individuals and entities carrying out business online. The governance measures that we adopt in response to the enhanced regulatory requirements may fail to meet these requirements and may lead to penalties or our loss of merchants to those platforms, or to complaints or claims made against us by customers on our platforms. 



In April 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the National Development and Reform Commission, MIIT, the Ministry of Public Security, the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Finance, MOC, the People’s Bank of China, SAMR, the National Radio and Television Administration, the National Administration of State Secrets Protection, the National Cryptography Administration promulgated Cybersecurity Review Measures, which came into effect on June 1, 2020. The Cybersecurity Review Measures provides that the operators of critical information infrastructure must pass a cybersecurity review when purchasing network products and services which do or may affect national security.

On June 10, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China, or the SCNPC, promulgated the PRC Data Security Law (《中华人民共和国数据安全法》), which has been taken effect on September 1, 2021. The PRC Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data activities, and introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development, as well as the degree of harm it will cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations when such data is tampered with, destroyed, leaked, or illegally acquired or used. The PRC Data Security Law also provides for a national security review procedure for data activities that may affect national security and imposes export restrictions on certain data and information. As uncertainties remain regarding the interpretation and implementation of these laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will comply with such regulations in all respects and we may be ordered to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities. We may also become subject to fines and/or other sanctions which may have material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.



On August 20, 2021, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China promulgated the PRC Personal Information Protection Law (《中华人民共和国个人信息保护法》), or the PIPL, which will take effect in November 2021. In addition to other rules and principles of personal information processing, the PIPL specifically provides rules for processing sensitive personal information. Sensitive personal information refers to personal information that, once leaked or illegally used, could easily lead to the infringement of human dignity or harm to the personal or property safety of an individual, including biometric recognition, religious belief, specific identity, medical and health, financial account, personal whereabouts and other information of an individual, as well as any personal information of a minor under the age of 14. Only where there is a specific purpose and sufficient necessity, and under circumstances where strict protection measures are taken, may personal information processors process sensitive personal information. A personal information processor shall inform the individual of the necessity of processing such sensitive personal information and the impact thereof on the individual’s rights and interests.



On December 28, 2021, the CAC published the Measures for Cybersecurity Review (2021), which became effective on February 15, 2022 and replace the Measures for Cybersecurity Review promulgated on April 13, 2020. The Measures for Cyber Security Review (2021) specifies that the procurement of network products and services by operator of critical information infrastructure and the activities of data process carried out by Internet platform operator that raise or may raise “national security” concerns are subject to strict cyber security review by Cybersecurity Review Office established by the CAC. Before critical information infrastructure operator purchases internet products and services, it should assess the potential risk of national security that may be caused by the use of such products and services. If such use of products and services may give raise to national security concerns, it should apply for a cybersecurity review by the Cybersecurity Review Office and a report of analysis of the potential effect on national security shall be submitted when the application is made. In addition, Internet platform operators that possess the personal data of over one million users must apply for a review by the Cybersecurity Review Office, if they plan to list their companies in foreign countries. The CAC may voluntarily conduct cyber security review if any network products and services and activities of data process affects or may affect national security. It may take approximately 70 business days in maximum for the general cybersecurity review upon the delivery of their applications, which may be subject to extensions for a special review.



As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary has not been informed by any PRC governmental authority of any requirement that it is subject to a cybersecurity review. As there remains significant uncertainty in the interpretation and enforcement of relevant PRC cybersecurity laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we would not be subject to such cybersecurity review requirement, and if so, that we would be able to pass such review in relation to this registration. In addition, we could become subject to enhanced cybersecurity review or investigations launched by PRC regulators in the future. Any failure or delay in the completion of the cybersecurity review procedures or any other non-compliance with the related laws and regulations may result in fines or other penalties, including suspension of business, website closure, removal of our app from the relevant app stores, and revocation of prerequisite licenses, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings or actions against us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

If an internet user utilizes internet services to commit a tortious act, the party whose rights are infringed may request the internet service provider to take measures, such as removing or blocking the content, or disabling the links thereto, to prevent or stop the infringement. If the internet service provider does not take necessary measures after receiving such notice, it shall be jointly liable for any further damages suffered by the rights holder. Furthermore, if an internet service provider fails to take necessary measures when it knows that an internet user utilizes its internet services to infringe the lawful rights and interests of other parties, it shall be jointly liable with the internet user for damages resulting from the infringement.



As of date of the Annual Report, we have not received any inquiry or notice from the PRC government concerning our compliance of such regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with ours.

Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange 



The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, promulgated by the State Council in 1996 and most recently amended in 2008. Under the PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from State Administration of Foreign Exchange or SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. By contrast, approval from or registration with appropriate governmental authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans.
In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 59, which was most recently amended in 2015 and substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedures. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 59, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts, such as pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts, and guarantee accounts, the reinvestment of Renminbi proceeds derived by foreign investors in China, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously.



In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, pursuant to which, instead of applying for approval regarding foreign exchange registrations of foreign direct investment and overseas direct investment from SAFE, entities and individuals may apply for such foreign exchange registrations from qualified banks. The qualified banks, under the supervision of SAFE, may directly review the applications and conduct the registration.



In March 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Administration of Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, a foreign-invested enterprise may, according to its actual business needs, settle with a bank the portion of the foreign exchange capital in its capital account for which the relevant foreign exchange administration has confirmed monetary capital contribution rights and interests (or for which the bank has registered the injection of the monetary capital contribution into the account). In addition, for the time being, foreign-invested enterprises are allowed to settle 100% of their foreign exchange capital on a discretionary basis. A foreign-invested enterprise shall truthfully use its capital for its own operational purposes within the scope of business. Where an ordinary foreign-invested enterprise makes domestic equity investment with the amount of foreign exchanges settled, the invested enterprise must first go through domestic re-investment registration and open a corresponding account for foreign exchange settlement pending payment with the foreign exchange administration or the bank at the place where it is registered.



In June 2016, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or SAFE Circular 16, pursuant to which, in addition to foreign currency capital, enterprises registered in China may also convert their foreign debts, as well as repatriated fund raised through overseas listing, from foreign currency to Renminbi on a discretional basis. SAFE Circular 16 also reiterates that the use of capital so converted shall follow “the principle of authenticity and self-use” within the business scope of the enterprise. According to SAFE Circular 16, the Renminbi funds so converted shall not be used for the purposes of, whether directly or indirectly, (i) paying expenditures beyond the business scope of the enterprises or prohibited by laws and regulations; (ii) making securities investment or other investments (except for banks’ principal-secured products); (iii) granting loans to non-affiliated enterprises, except as expressly permitted in the business license; and (iv) purchasing non-self-used real estate (except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises).



In January 2017, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Improving Reform of Foreign Exchange Administration and Optimizing Genuineness and Compliance Verification, or SAFE Circular 3, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to the outbound remittance of profit from domestic entities to offshore entities, including (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records, and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Further, pursuant to SAFE Circular 3, domestic entities shall make detailed explanations of the sources of capital and utilization arrangements, and provide board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment.





28







On October 23, 2019, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Promoting the Facilitation of Cross-border Trade and Investment, or SAFE Circular 28, which allows non-investment foreign-invested enterprises to make domestic equity investment with their capital funds in accordance with the law under the premise that such investment does not violate the existing special administrative measures (negative list) for foreign investment and the project invested in China is authentic and compliant. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 28, upon receiving the payment of consideration from a foreign investor for the equity transfer under foreign direct investment, the domestic transferor, with relevant registration certificates, can process the formalities for account opening, fund receipt, and foreign exchange settlement and use directly at the bank. The foreign investor’s deposit remitted from overseas or transferred from domestic accounts can be directly used for its lawful domestic capital contribution as well as domestic and overseas payment after the transaction is concluded.



On April 10, 2020, SAFE issued the Circular on Optimizing Administration of Foreign Exchange to Support the Development of Foreign-related Business, or SAFE Circular 8, pursuant to which, eligible enterprises are allowed to use the income under capital account, from such sources as capital funds, foreign debt and overseas listing, for domestic payment without having to provide supporting authentication materials to the banks for every transaction in advance, but the use of funds shall be true and compliant as well as conform to the existing administration regulations regarding use of income under capital account. The concerned bank shall conduct spot checking in accordance with the relevant requirements.



Regulations Related to Dividend Distribution



The principal regulations governing the distribution of dividends paid by WFOEs include the Company Law of PRC, which applies to both PRC domestic companies and foreign-invested companies, and the Foreign Investment Law and its implementing rules, which apply to foreign-invested companies. Under these regulations, WFOEs in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a WFOE in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards each year to its general reserves until its cumulative total reserve funds reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserve funds, however, may not be distributed as cash dividends.
Regulations Related to Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by PRC Residents



In July 2014, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Issues concerning Foreign Exchange Administration over the Overseas Investment and Financing and Round-trip Investment by Domestic Residents via Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37 which was most recently amended on June 15, 2018 and has replaced the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents’ Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles (known as Circular 75). SAFE Circular 37 regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or “SPVs,” by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing or conduct round trip investment in China. Under SAFE Circular 37, an SPV refers to an offshore entity established or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC residents or entities for the purpose of seeking offshore financing or making offshore investment, using legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests, while “round trip investment” refers to the direct investment in China by PRC residents or entities through SPVs, namely, establishing foreign-invested enterprises to obtain the ownership, control rights and management rights. Circular 37 requires that, before making contribution into an SPV, PRC residents or entities are required to complete foreign exchange registration with SAFE or its local branch.



In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the SAFE Circular 13. SAFE Circular 13 has amended SAFE Circular 37 by requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks instead of SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment of an SPV.



In addition, pursuant to SAFE Circular 37, an amendment to registration or subsequent filing with qualified banks by such PRC resident is also required if there is a material change with respect to the capital of the offshore company, such as any change of basic information (including change of such PRC residents, change of name and operation term of the SPV), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. Failure to comply with the registration requirements as set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and SAFE Circular 13, misrepresent on or failure to disclose controllers of foreign-invested enterprises that are established by round-trip investment may result in bans on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliates, and may also subject relevant PRC residents to penalties under the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations of the PRC.





29







Regulations Related to Foreign Debt



As an offshore holding company, we may make additional capital contributions to PRC subsidiary subject to approval from the local department of commerce and the SAFE, with no limitation on the amount of capital contributions. We may also make loans to our PRC subsidiary subject to the approval from SAFE or its local office and the limitation on the amount of loans.



By means of making loans, WFOE is subject to the relevant PRC laws and regulation relating to foreign debts. On January 8, 2003, the State Development Planning Commission, SAFE, and Ministry of Finance, or MOF, jointly promulgated the Circular on the Interim Provisions on the Management of Foreign Debts, or the Foreign Debts Provisions, which became effective on March 1, 2003, and was partially abolished on May 10, 2015. Pursuant to Foreign Debts Provisions, the total amount of foreign loans received by a foreign-invested company shall not exceed the difference between the total investment in projects as approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterpart and the amount of registered capital of such foreign-invested company. In addition, on January 12, 2017, the People’s Bank of China, or PBOC, issued the Circular on Full-Coverage Macro-Prudent Management of Cross-Border Financing, or the PBOC Circular 9, which sets out the statutory upper limit on the foreign debts for PRC non-financial entities, including both foreign-invested companies and domestic-invested companies, and the macro-prudential adjustment parameter is 1. Pursuant to the PBOC Circular 9, the foreign debt upper limit for both foreign-invested companies and domestic-invested companies is calculated as twice the net asset of such companies. As to net assets, the companies shall take the net assets value stated in their latest audited financial statement. On March 11, 2020, the PBOC and SAFE promulgated the Circular of the People’s Bank of China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Adjusting the Macro-prudential Regulation Parameter for Full-covered Cross-border Financing, which provides that based on the current macro economy and international balance of payments, the macro-prudential regulation parameter as set forth in the PBOC Circular 9 is updated from 1 to 1.25. 



The PBOC Circular 9 does not supersede the Foreign Debts Provisions. It provides a one-year transitional period from January 11, 2017, for foreign-invested companies, during which foreign-invested companies, such as our PRC subsidiary, could adopt their calculation method of foreign debt upper limit based on either the Foreign Debts Provisions or the PBOC Circular 9.

Regulations Related to Tax



Enterprise Income Tax



On March 16, 2007, the SCNPC promulgated the EIT Law, which was recently amended on December 29, 2018. On December 6, 2007, the State Council enacted the Regulations for the Implementation of the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which was amended on April 23, 2019. Under the EIT Law and relevant implementation regulations, both resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises are subject to the enterprise income tax so long as their income is generated within the territory of PRC. “Resident enterprises” are defined as enterprises that are established in China in accordance with PRC laws, or that are established in accordance with the laws of foreign countries but are actually or in effect controlled from within the PRC. “Non-resident enterprises” are defined as enterprises that are organized under the laws of foreign countries and whose actual management is conducted outside the PRC, but have established institutions or premises in the PRC, or have no such established institutions or premises but have income generated from inside the PRC. Under the EIT Law and relevant implementing regulations, a uniform corporate income tax rate of 25% is applied. If non-resident enterprises have not formed permanent establishments or premises in the PRC, or if they have formed permanent establishment or premises in the PRC but there is no actual relationship between the relevant income derived in the PRC and the established institutions or premises set up by them, however, enterprise income tax is set at the rate of 10% with respect to their income sourced from inside the PRC.



The EIT Law and its implementation rules permit certain “high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state” that independently own core intellectual property and meet statutory criteria, to enjoy a reduced 15% enterprise income tax rate.



According to the Administrative Rules for the Certification of High Tech Enterprises, effective on January 1, 2008 and amended on January 29, 2016 (effective as of January 1, 2016), for each entity accredited as High Tech Enterprise, such status is valid for three years if it meets the qualifications for High Tech Enterprise on a continuing basis during such period.

Value-Added Tax (“VAT”)



The Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax was promulgated by the State Council on December 13, 1993, and most recently amended on November 19, 2017. The Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations of the PRC on Value-added Tax (Revised in 2011) were promulgated by the MOF on December 25, 1993, and were recently amended on October 28, 2011 (collectively with the VAT Regulations, the VAT Law). On April 4, 2018, MOF and SAT jointly promulgated the Circular on Adjustment of Value-Added Tax Rates, or MOF and SAT Circular 32. On March 20, 2019, MOF, SAT and General Administration of Customs, or GAC, jointly issued a Circular on Relevant Polices for Deepening Value-added Tax Reform, or MOF, SAT and GAC Circular 39, which became effective from April 1, 2019. According to the abovementioned laws and circulars, all enterprises and individuals engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of processing, repair and replacement services, sales of services, intangible assets, real property and the importation of goods within the territory of the PRC are the taxpayers of VAT. The VAT tax rates generally applicable are simplified as 13%, 9%, 6% and 0%, and the VAT tax rate applicable to the small-scale taxpayers is 3%.



Withholding Tax



The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC provides that since January 1, 2008, an income tax rate of 10% will normally be applicable to dividends declared to non-PRC resident investors which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment or place of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC.



Pursuant to an Arrangement Between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Incomes, or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, and other applicable PRC laws, if a Hong Kong resident enterprise is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied the relevant conditions and requirements under such Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other applicable laws, the 10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise receives from a PRC resident enterprise may be reduced to 5%. Based on the Circular on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, or the SAT Circular 81, issued on February 20, 2009, by the SAT, however, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment. According to the Circular on Several Questions regarding the “Beneficial Owner” in Tax Treaties, which was issued on February 3, 2018, by the SAT and took effect on April 1, 2018, when determining the applicant’s status of the “beneficial owner” regarding tax treatments in connection with dividends, interests or royalties in the tax treaties, several factors, including without limitation, whether the applicant is obligated to pay more than 50% of his or her income in 12 months to residents in third country or region, whether the business operated by the applicant constitutes the actual business activities, and whether the counterparty country or region to the tax treaties does not levy any tax or grant tax exemption on relevant incomes or levy tax at an extremely low rate, will be taken into account, and it will be analyzed according to the actual circumstances of the specific cases. This circular further provides that applicants who intend to prove his or her status of the “beneficial owner” shall submit the relevant documents to the relevant tax bureau according to the Announcement on Issuing the Measures for the Administration of Non-Resident Taxpayers’ Enjoyment of the Treatment under Tax Agreements.



Tax on Indirect Transfer



On February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Circular on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 7. Pursuant to SAT Circular 7, an “indirect transfer” of assets, including equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises, may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. When determining whether there is a “reasonable commercial purpose” of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration include, inter alia, whether the main value of the equity interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives directly or indirectly from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise mainly consist of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income is mainly derived from China; and whether the offshore enterprise and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their actual function and risk exposure. According to SAT Circular 7, where the transferee fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor shall declare and pay such tax to the tax authority by itself within the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. SAT Circular 7 does not apply to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were acquired on a public stock exchange. On October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Circular on Issues of Tax Withholding regarding Non-PRC Resident Enterprise Income Tax, or SAT Circular 37, which further elaborates the relevant implemental rules regarding the calculation, reporting and payment obligations of the withholding tax by the non-resident enterprises. Nonetheless, there remain uncertainties as to the interpretation and application of SAT Circular 7. SAT Circular 7 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to our offshore transactions or sale of our shares or those of our offshore subsidiaries where non-resident enterprises, being the transferors, were involved.

Employer and employee are also required to pay and deposit housing funds, with an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year in full and on time.

As a remediation, our PRC subsidiary started to deposit the adequate contributions to the housing funds from July 2021 onwards. Before July 2021, our PRC subsidiary failed to deposit adequate contributions of housing provident fund for all employees in accordance with Article 15 of the regulations on the administration of housing provident fund. As of the date of this Annual Report, our PRC subsidiary did not receive any warning and punishment notice from the authority. If any employee reports the non-compliance to the authority later, it will be handled in accordance with Article 38 of the regulations on the administration of housing provident fund, which is that the housing provident fund management center shall order our Chinese subsidiary to deposit or make up the payment within a time limit; and if our Chinese subsidiary fails to pay or make up the payment within the time limit, the reporting employee may apply to the people’s court for enforcement.

Smaller Reporting Company



The Company is a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a “smaller reporting company”, these exemptions will continue to be available to us.
Emerging Growth Company



As a public company with less than $1.235 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies, and can avail itself to various exemptions such as an exemption from Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Section 14(a) and (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



In particular, as an emerging growth company, the Company:




● | is not required to obtain an attestation and report from its auditors on our management’s assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing its compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as “compensation discussion and analysis”); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from its stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden-parachute” votes); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”); and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | is eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






34







The Company intends to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under §107 of the JOBS Act. The Company’s election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare its financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under §107 of the JOBS Act.



Certain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to the Company due to the fact that it also qualifies as a “smaller reporting company” under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.



Under the JOBS Act, the Company may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that the Company would cease to be an “emerging growth company” if it has more than $1.235 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of its Common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. The Company would cease to be an emerging growth company on the last day of the fiscal year following the date of the fifth anniversary of its first sale of common equity securities under an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or a fiscal year in which we have $1 billion in gross revenues. Further, under current SEC rules the Company will continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” for so long as it has a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
