Our corporate structure is as follows:
 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
The Company has seen a business opportunity in wholesaling and retailing high quality, sustainable, environmentally friendly bio-carbon-based fertilizer (herein referred to as “BCBF”), which is capable of not only increasing the crop yield but also at the same time preserving the environment. The Company’s BCBF is sourced from, and produced by, a third party through heating straw in a closed container with little or no available air. This method is also known as thermal decomposition of organic material under limited supply of oxygen at relatively low temperature. In accordance with requirements imposed by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture, the Company’s Supplier of BCBF has registered with Sichuan Province Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, which has an effective period of 5 years, from December 2019 to December 2024. The Company does not maintain or operate any production and/or manufacturing of any BCBF facility, machine and/or equipment.

The Company is currently wholesaling and retailing BCBF through its wholly owned subsidiary SCQC. Management of the Company believes that the BCBF sold by the Company is capable of maintaining soil fertility, enhancing crop yield, improving soil structure, improving water and fertilizer retention capability and improving fertilizer utilization efficiency and effectiveness. This is achieved through balancing carbon and nitrogen content, neutralizing soil pH while at the same time creating soil particle structure that is conducive to plant growth.
 
The BCBF sold by the Company, produced through straw thermal decomposition, replaces the function of activated carbon. The combination of soil and BCBF is capable of absorbing and reducing pollution content such as heavy metals from agricultural residual wastes. Further, the combination of water and BCBF is capable of purifying water by producing carbohydrate and glucose, which could be absorbed by, and is conducive to the growth of, plants. Additionally, BCBF possesses outstanding water storage capacity, which can store up to 10 times the water content when compared to soil without BCBF, which in turn provides farmers greater flexibility during times of hardship such as a drought.
 
As such, the management of the Company believes that the Company’s BCBF is not only a superior option compared to conventional fertilizer in terms of environmentally sustainability, but also from an economic perspective due to the improvement in crop yield quality and quantity. The Company’s BCBF consists of roughly 45% organic matter, 20% bio-charcoal, 10% humic acid, 5% NPK and boats an effective microorganism count of 20,000,000 per gram.
 
On July 25, 2022, the Company ventures into online retailing business through e-commerce platform, retailing a series of daily use products covering from healthcare products, cosmetic products, fashion products, household products and so forth. Customer will place order through platform and make payment accordingly of which shall be collected by Company. Meanwhile Company shall place exact order towards supplier and supplier will deliver such ordered products directly to customer, settlement between Company and supplier will take place once a week. It is worth mentioning that the Company act as the intermediary role and do not keep any form of inventory throughout the transaction.

Business Model
 
The Company previously sources all supply of BCBF from an independent single supplier and doesn’t have any definitive plan to continue to source from such supplier or any other alternative. The Company believes current stock level is sufficient to cover next 12 months sales demand.
 
The Company adopts what is commonly referred to as a virtual network business structure, as the Company only maintains internal procurement, sales and marketing, operational, accounting and finance functions. We rely entirely on an independent third party for other crucial functions, such as production and packaging, storage, courier inward and outward. It is our belief that this business structure empowers the Company with a higher degree of flexibility to exploit market opportunity, but it is also difficult to ascertain the quality of BCBF sourced and stored externally. Confidentiality of information, such as the identity of customers, is also at risk because such information is shared amongst designated warehouses, the responsibility of which is discussed below.
 
Procurement Order and Courier Inward
 
As per our practices with previous supplier, the Company, through subsidiary SCQC, has prepaid a mutually agreed upon deposit to the supplier. Upon placing an order with the supplier, they will either move to production of the requested BCBF or, if stock is readily available, they will ship the requested amount to designated warehouse operate and owned by third party (herein referred as the “Warehouser”).
 
Shipment costs are borne solely by SCQC, while any remaining outstanding payable balance to supplier, if not covered by the deposit to the supplier, shall be settled upon arrival of products.
 
The Company believes, for future procurement with alternate supplier is highly likely to follow this pattern of procurement order.
 
Storage, Dispatch Order and Courier Outward
 
Upon the arrival of BCBF, Warehouser shall examine the condition and quantity of BCBF based upon instructions provided by SCQC. If the BCBF meets quality standards, they will unload the BCBF from the supplier’s logistic vehicle and will proceed to store the BCBF. Warehouser bears responsibility to ensure that the condition of the warehouse is optimal for storage.
 
Upon receiving dispatch orders from SCQC, the warehouse personnel shall be responsible to deliver BCBF to customers’ location, as designated by SCQC and to subsequently collect a receipt from SCQC customers.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The Company, through SCQC, retails and wholesales BCBF, primarily to farmers. We rely upon sales and marketing personnel at present, and it is our intention to establish product branding and a positive reputation which will allow us to grow beyond internal sales and marketing. On top of existing sales personnel, the Company also intends to capitalize on customer connections through a referral program which rewards referring customers with discounts. All such plans pertaining to the referral program remain in development, and we cannot state with any level of specificity when they will move beyond the planning stages.
 
Generally, retail and wholesale customers are not entitled for a credit term, the only difference is that for retail customers all payments must be settled immediately upon placing the order, at which point SCQC will issue a dispatch order to the warehouse. Whereas for wholesale customers, a deposit can be made upon placing the order and the remaining balance is to be settled upon delivery of BCBF. However, in certain cases, or from time to time at the discretion of Management, SCQC may grant customers a certain credit term if they believe it to be beneficial to the performance and business sustainability of the Company in the long term.
 
Employees and Function
 
The Company has 6 employees. All of them work on a full-time basis, including our director, Ms. Wang Min. The Company provides benefits to each employee excluding sales, marketing and after sales service department employee, in the form of $40 travelling allowance per month and a $40 telecommunication allowance per month. Additionally, the Company maintains mandatory social security for pensions, medical, unemployment, work-related injury and maternity insurance. The Company segregates individual employees in accordance to function as displayed below:

Functions | Number of Employees 
------------------------------------------------+------------------------
Management | 
Sales, Marketing, and After Sales Service | 
Accounting, Finance, and Internal Operation | 
Total | 6 

Competition
 
Overall, the competitive environment of China’s fertilizer industry is very tense despite its market size. The Company competes with other manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers such as China Green Agriculture, Inc. (NYSE: CGA), Sinofert Holdings Limited (HKG: 0297) and Xinyangfeng Agricultural Technology Co Ltd (SHE: 000902). These competitors possess significantly greater financial and non-financial resources, manufacturing capacity, well established business models and distribution channels and branding.
 
At present, the Company relies entirely on its existing relationship with customers in order to function within this competitive fertilizer industry. However, despite intensive competition our director is confident to develop and enlarge our market share in China.
