Ideanomics Mobility’s focus is electric vehicles, including mid- and last -mile delivery trucks and vans, tractors, and two-wheelers. Ideanomics Energy’s focus is charging and energy-related products and services. Ideanomics Capital’s focus is providing financing support for the Company’s Mobility and Energy business units.
Principal Products or Services and Their Markets
Ideanomics Mobility
The Ideanomics Mobility business unit contains the Company’s vehicle-related operations, selling differentiated electric vehicles across several categories, and providing technology and components to other OEMs. Ideanomics Mobility’s innovative vehicle offering across the categories of vans and trucks, motorcycles and scooters, tractors, and specialist vehicles are further differentiated by the company’s ability to offer charging infrastructure and financing support to its customers. 
Subsidiaries
There are five operating companies within the Ideanomics Mobility business unit: (1) VIA, (2) Energica, (3) Solectrac, (4) US Hybrid, and (5) Tree Technologies.
1.VIA
VIA is an all-electric commercial vehicle company with innovative advanced electric drive technology, delivering sustainable mobility solutions for the marketplace. VIA possesses over a decade of electric drive experience from its previous generation vehicles, with over 7 million miles of on-road customer experience contributing to its design and development of its current generation of vehicles. VIA designs, manufactures, and markets electric commercial vehicles, with superior life-cycle economics, for use across a broad cross-section of the global fleet customer base. VIA’s value is rooted in its VDRIVE™ electric skateboard and VTRUX® modular vehicle portfolio, which has been designed from the ground up to meet the needs of commercial fleet operators and drivers. VIA will offer a comprehensive range of fit-for-purpose configurations with its chassis cab including last-mile delivery vans, box and stake trucks, school buses and shuttles and more.
VIA has developed a proprietary commercial battery electric skateboard architecture designed to serve the high-growth Class 2 to 5 local and last mile delivery market segment. The skateboard architecture provides opportunities to customize the vehicle configuration in a number of configurations to meet specific customer needs. VIA anticipates starting commercial production in late 2024 with Ideanomics’ support in the development and validation of the product in accordance with the current business plan.
VIA’s scalable VDRIVE™ skateboard platform is designed for use across Class 2 to 5 vehicles, supporting multiple battery sizes (to provide 125-250 miles of range). The skateboard architecture allows use of a wide range of body styles. The VIA skateboard is designed in a customer-centric approach that addressed many of the common challenges customers have with last-mile delivery vehicles, such as a low load floor and step-in height, and a flat floor from the cab through the rear of the vehicle to make it fast and easy for drivers to enter and exit the vehicles, increasing efficiency. Additionally, the VIA architecture is designed to enhance maneuverability, improve driver visibility, and provide greater cargo volume with its ‘cab forward’ design 
(also known as cab-over, COE (Cab Over Engine), or forward control),which has the driver cab sitting above rather than behind the front axle.
VIA’s flexible VTRUX® vehicle architecture permits VIA to offer a full portfolio of vehicle bodies, including trucks, vans, and buses.
While VIA has not yet commenced sales, it has developed demo vehicles that have been used for sales purposes and in testing and use with its customers for further customer feedback. VIA has secured an initial order for 2,000 VIA chassis with Pegasus Specialty Vehicles , which intends to use them to build Type A school buses, electric shuttles, and paratransit buses, has a memorandum of understanding with AUSEV Pty Ltd to provide 6,600 vans and chassis cabs for conversion to right-hand drive for the Australian market, and has a strategic partnership with EAVX, LLC, a business unit of J.B. Poindexter & Co, as part of a strategic partnership to develop a Class 2b electric van.

Additionally, Tree Technologies will begin collaborating with Energica on joint sales and marketing strategies for the region. 
Ideanomics Energy
Ideanomics Energy is the Company's business unit focused on charging and energy products and services. Ideanomics Energy has as its mission to provide fleet operators with a turn-key charging solution as part of their electrification initiatives. It does this with a team of trusted experts to analyze impacts of electrification on operations and to plan and deploy the right hardware, including robust, user-friendly charging technologies, supported by an intuitive Energy Management platform that Ideanomics Energy is developing. This is supported through collaboration with Ideanomics Capital to introduce a CaaS model to package upfront costs as a recurring monthly operating expense. Ideanomics Energy’s subsidiary is WAVE Charging, which offers WAVE wireless charging, PEA’s containerized DC fast charging system, the Mahle chargeBIG level-2 charging solution, and more.
WAVE Charging
In 2023, Ideanomics Energy began consolidating its EV charging operations under a single brand, WAVE Charging, capitalizing on the brand recognition of the WAVE wireless charging product.

a.WAVE wireless charging: a high-power inductive (wireless) charging solution for medium and heavy-duty EVs. A proven solution, WAVE wireless charging is powering America’s first all-electric bus fleet in California, the electric Tram System at Universal Studios Hollywood, and is being deployed as part of a pilot project by a leading e-commerce company. The company continues to expand its high-powered induction capabilities beyond 250kW, successfully delivering systems at 125kW and conducting test deployments at 500kW, and is conducting research and development on a 1-Megawatt system for heavy trucking applications. 
b.PEA Containerized Charging: A new way to think about charging for commercial fleets, containerized charging is fast, easy, and affordable. Importantly, it is scalable with fleet needs. The size of a standard 20-foot shipping container, each system can charge up to 20 vehicles with 400 kilowatts per vehicle, with the potential to deliver up to 700kW of power with select cables. WAVE Charging has exclusive sales and distribution rights for this product in North America until mid 2029. 
c.ChargeBIG: The chargeBIG 18-36 AC system's centralized control unit is easy to install, and provides dynamic load management for up to 36 individual charging points with a charging power of either 7 kW, 11 kW or 19 kW. This allows for the most efficient charge across multiple EVs, and can charge twice as many vehicles compared to competing products. Ideanomics has exclusive rights until early 2028 to distribute the chargeBIG 18-36 AC charging system under the WAVE Charging brand in North America.
Additionally, WAVE Charging provides white-glove service to help fleet operators electrify, partnering with customers to identify the best fitting charging solution for their fleet. This includes analyzing a customer’s current and future electric vehicle fleet and operations to offer a future-proof charging solution.
Wave Charging is the preferred charging solutions provider for VIA's electric work trucks. Together, WAVE Charging and VIA plan to offer a cost-efficient, integrated EV and charging solution for commercial fleets, which has been sorely lacking in the market. The WAVE Charging and VIA team will work together to engage customers collaboratively. 
PEA
On August 2, 2021, the Company announced a strategic investment in PEA, a business unit within the Prettl Group, a large German industrial company that manufactures and distributes components and systems for the automotive, energy, and electronics industries. The terms include a strategic investment of €7.5 million ($9.1 million) for 11,175 preferred shares. Ideanomics received exclusive sales and distribution rights for PEA charging infrastructure products and solutions in North America and CEO Alf Poor joined PEA's Board of Directors.
Ideanomics Capital
Ideanomics Capital provides financing support for the Company’s Charging-as-a-Service and Vehicle-as-a-Service business models, as well as businesses focused on leveraging technology and innovation to improve efficiency, transparency, and profitability for the financial services industry.
The Company’s Ideanomics Capital business unit provides capital market expertise to enable the sale of its subsidiaries’ products and services. It aligns financing resources and develops funding structures that enable growth and revenue generation for the Ideanomics Mobility business unit. Financing structures will include service and products for payment such as CaaS and VaaS. These options will form part of Ideanomics offering to commercial fleet operators. Over time, it is Ideanomics intention to focus Ideanomics Capital as the financial services arm of Ideanomics Mobility and Ideanomics Energy, and to divest its non-EV assets accordingly.
Centers of Excellence in Design and Digital Technologies
To support the Company’s EV operations, Ideanomics has created internal centers of excellence in automotive design and software. 
Ideanomics Design provides vehicle and industrial design services across Ideanomics (including to VIA, Solectrac, and Ideanomics Energy) and is developing a slate of external customers to offset its costs and generate external revenue. 
Ideanomics Digital provides IT and software development services across the entirety of Ideanomics, including management of the Company’s strategic relationship with Google Cloud, and the development of the Company’s cloud-based vehicle, charging, and energy management software platform, a central component to Ideanomics’ unified fleet electrification offering. With its centralized telematics, charging, and energy management software, Ideanomics will have the ability to monitor and optimize its clients’ usage of vehicles and energy, particularly VaaS and CaaS clients, where the client is relying on Ideanomics for its turnkey EV fleet rollout and management. These products and services are still in development.
Other Businesses
The Company has identified and informed the market of its desire to restructure and divest certain businesses deemed outside of its core focus.
Ideanomics China (formerly known as Mobile Energy Global) 
The Company is continuing to restructure its operations in China as it shifts more focus toward the US market opportunity. Ideanomics China is continuing to support supply chain operations for the rest of the companies within Ideanomics. 
Timios & JUSTLY
In 2022, Ideanomics announced that it has begun the process to spin out its fintech businesses JUSTLY as well as title company Timios. This divestiture is part of Ideanomics' strategy to exit from non-core market segments, further honing its portfolio and enabling better, faster delivery of its growth ambitions in the EV market. JUSTLY and Timios have talented management and staff each with a strong track record of delivery in their respective markets. We believe that the divestiture will enable the two companies to grow faster and capture new market opportunities, while delivering value to Ideanomics shareholders.
Competitive Business Conditions, Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition
The markets in which we participate are dynamic and highly competitive, requiring companies to react quickly to capitalize on opportunity. We retain skilled and experienced personnel and deploy substantial resources to meet the changing demands of the 
industry and to capitalize on change. The market for our products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological development. We encounter domestic and international competition across all units of our business, which we anticipate will increase as the commercial EV vehicle and associated charging markets mature.
Ideanomics Mobility and Ideanomics Energy
The company’s EV business operates in the market for fleet commercial vehicles, which is still in the development stage. The company could face competition from other companies that develop and operate a similar integrated platform for the procurement, purchase, financing, charging, and energy management needs of fleet EV operators. The company could also face competition from companies that only operate in one part of the vehicle purchase and operation cycle, for example, an EV vehicle or charging manufacturer may sell directly to EV fleet operators. 
Purchasers of commercial vehicles in the U.S. currently have the choice between traditional ICE vehicles and EVs. According to BloombergNEF, in 2022, battery electric vehicles accounted for less than 1.0% of U.S. commercial vehicle sales (light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty commercial vehicles). BloombergNEF expect this to rise to 11.0% of all commercial vehicles sold in 2027. The most important drivers for the development of the commercial fleet EV market are federal and state mandates relating to clean air and electric vehicles including subsidies and incentives to help owners of fleets of commercial vehicles convert from combustion engines to EV. The speed at which fleet operators convert to EV is highly correlated with government regulations, targets and related subsidies and incentives. If the governments, or municipalities, change the regulations, targets, incentives or subsidies then the rate at which fleet operators convert their vehicles to EV could slow down which in turn may lead to lower revenues for the Company. Additionally, the rate and form in which the commercial fleet EV market develops is dependent upon technological developments in battery and charging systems; and the deployment of the charging infrastructure and electric grid infrastructure to support widespread commercial EV use. Considering all of these factors, commercial fleet operators are likely to continue to purchase primarily ICE vehicles for at least the next five years, and possibly longer.
Ideanomics Capital
The Company’s Ideanomics Capital business unit operates in sectors that are undergoing rapid change. The Company’s legacy fintech business operates in several markets, with Timios providing title and escrow services throughout the U.S. Timios has many competitors, some of whom may have a broader geographic reach within this market, and may be more well-capitalized and therefore more able to weather a downturn in business volume resulting from an increase in interest rates.
JUSTLY is a FINRA registered broker-dealer, which operates a platform focused on private equity and debt. Among other business endeavors, JUSTLY operates a crowdfunding equity platform of private impact investments to advisors, registered investment advisors, family offices, angels, and accredited and non-accredited investors from all income levels. JUSTLY is engaged in business in a highly competitive, constantly evolving marketplace, requiring continually advancing pricing sophistication and technological capabilities relative to its competitors and necessitating the differentiation of their product offerings. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
The Company’s businesses depend on a ready supply of components and parts that are sourced domestically and internationally and any interruption to the supply of these could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results. The Company’s suppliers that manufacture components and parts, which includes EV motors and batteries, depend on a ready supply of raw materials and components. Consequently a shortage of raw materials or components could adversely impact their manufacturing process and, potentially, impact the Company’s revenues as it may not be able to complete orders that it has received. The Company may also be adversely impacted if global logistics and supply chains are interrupted.
Our products are manufactured or assembled from both standard components and parts that are unique to our specifications. Our internal manufacturing operations are largely process-oriented and we use significant quantities of various raw materials, including aluminum, copper, steel, bimetals, optical fiber and plastics and other polymers, among others. Other parts are produced using processes such as stamping, machining, molding and pressing from metals or plastics. Portions of the requirements for these materials are purchased under supply arrangements where some portion of the unit pricing may be indexed to commodity market prices for these metals. We may occasionally enter forward purchase commitments or otherwise secure availability for specific commodities to mitigate our exposure to price changes for a portion of our anticipated purchases. Certain of the raw materials utilized in our products may only be available from a few suppliers, and we may enter into longer term agreements to secure access to certain key inputs. We may, therefore, encounter significant price increases and/or availability issues for the materials we obtain from these suppliers, such as those that we saw in 2021, due to the continuing 
effects of Covid-19 pandemic. These supply chain constraints have limited our ability to manufacture and deliver products to our customers in 2022 and we expect this to continue into 2023
Our profitability has been and may continue to be materially affected by changes in the market price of our raw materials and components, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. Prices for, and for certain materials, availability of, lithium, aluminum, copper, plastics, silicon and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have fluctuated substantially during the past several years. We have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again. Delays in implementing price increases, failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases, or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.
In addition, some of our products are assembled from specialized components and subassemblies manufactured by third-party suppliers. We depend upon sole suppliers for certain of these components, including capacitors, memory devices and silicon chips. Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected if these suppliers cannot provide these components in sufficient quantity and quality on a timely and cost-efficient basis. We believe that our supply contracts and our supplier contingency plans mitigate some of this risk, however there is no way to fully remove said risk. For example, political, economic, or other actions by the PRC in Taiwan may adversely affect our ability to source microchips from suppliers in Taiwan. Any political, economic, or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain, for which Taiwan is a central hub, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on us.
Our supply agreements include technology licensing and component purchase contracts, and several of our competitors have similar supply agreements for these components. There can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these supply agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, we license software for operating network and security systems or sub-systems and a variety of routing protocols from different suppliers.
Seasonality
The Company expects that orders and sales will be influenced by the amount and timing of budgeted expenditure by its customers. Typically, the Company would expect to see higher sales at the start of the year when companies start executing on their capital programs and at the end of the year when companies are spending any surplus or uncommitted budget before the new budget cycle commences, though certain of the company’s operating companies which such as Solectrac and Energica operate in industries typically affected by reduced sales during the winter months at the end and beginning of each year. The Company’s other EV operating businesses are in the early stage of their development and consequently do not have sufficient trading histories to project seasonal buying patterns with any degree of confidence. 
Orders and sales in our Ideanomics Capital business unit will principally be influenced by changes in interest rates and the resulting impact on in the U.S. housing market particularly as it relates to purchases of homes and the refinancing of existing mortgages which are central to our Timios business.
Working Capital Requirements
As the Company expands its business the need for working capital will continue to grow. The Company acquired one company in 2022 and, along with its existing operations, most of its subsidiaries are considered growth companies at various stages of maturity. For these reasons it will require working capital for both organic growth of those business plus for the purchase of components for the manufacture and assembly of the Company’s respective EV and wired and wireless charging systems. The Company will continue to raise both debt and equity capital to support the working capital needs of these businesses and its U.S. headquarters functions.
Trademarks, Patents and Licenses
We hold various patents and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We have a number of pending patent applications relating to new products and technology. We will continue to file additional patent applications on new inventions, as appropriate, demonstrating our commitment to technology and innovation. For technology that is not owned by us, we look to establish strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements, as we have successfully demonstrated with AC charging partner Mable for obtaining appropriate licenses and/or distribution rights to help ensure that we have the necessary coverage for our products. In addition, we have formed strategic relationships with leading technology companies to provide us with early access to technology that we believe will help keep us at the forefront of our industry. Although we believe our intellectual property rights play a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve, we do not believe we would 
be materially adversely affected by the expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights. 
Business and Customer Concentration
The Company is in the process of building out its Ideanomics Mobility and Energy units and has not yet reached a stage of development where the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Timios’ title and escrow service depends upon a network of referring financial institutions. The loss of referrals from the larger referring financial institutions would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Reliance on Government Contracts
In its operations the Company does not typically contract directly with national governments, however it may contract with federal or state agencies, and local municipalities.
Corporate Structure
Ideanomics is a Nevada corporation existing as an operating company that conducts a substantial majority of its operations through thirty-four (34) of its operating subsidiaries established in various jurisdictions including the United States, Italy, Spain, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and England and Wales, and eleven (11) subsidiaries with no operations acting solely as holding companies. As the year ended December 31, 2022, there are twenty two (22) operating subsidiaries of Ideanomics in the United States and five (5) PRC subsidiaries. In addition, fourteen (14) of the subsidiaries of the Company are referred to as dormant subsidiaries that ceased their operations, remain not liquidated solely for the purpose of compliance with administrative formalities, and are expected to be liquidated within 12 months. No contractual agreements exist between the Company and its subsidiaries including its PRC subsidiaries because the Company believes that direct ownership is a more effective approach to the corporate structure. The organizational structure of the Company is comprised of a total of fifty-nine (59) subsidiaries.
Other than intercompany loans, no contractual agreements exist between the Company and its subsidiaries including its PRC subsidiaries because the Company believes that direct ownership is a more effective approach to the corporate structure.
Government Regulations
Rules and Regulations Material to our Business
Vehicle Safety and Testing
In the U.S., some of our vehicles are subject to regulation by the NHTSA, including all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard. While our current vehicles fully comply with applicable regulations and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time and while we anticipate being in compliance with the proposed changes, there is no assurance until final regulation changes are enacted. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S. 
We are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA including labeling requirements and other information provided to customers in writing, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and additional requirements for cooperating with compliance and safety investigations and recall reporting. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the EPA, and New Car Assessment Program ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available. 
Our vehicles sold outside of the U.S. are subject to similar foreign compliance, safety, environmental and other regulations. Many of those regulations are different from those applicable in the U.S. and may require redesign and/or retesting. Some of those regulations impact or prevent the rollout of new vehicle features. Additionally, the European Union established new rules regarding additional compliance oversight that commenced in 2020. There is also regulatory uncertainty regarding how these rules will impact sales in the United Kingdom given its withdrawal from the E.U. 
Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
In the U.S., state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution, sale and service of motor vehicles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to residents. Certain states have asserted that the laws in such states do not permit manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer, or that they otherwise restrict a manufacturer’s ability to deliver or service vehicles. 
Battery Safety and Testing
Our battery packs are subject to various U.S. and international regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium-ion batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of shipping transportation, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck or air. We conduct testing to demonstrate our compliance with such regulations.
As indicated above, we primarily use lithium-ion cells in the high voltage battery packs of our vehicles and energy storage products. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future. 
Solar Energy—General
We are subject to certain state and federal regulations applicable to solar and battery storage providers and sellers of electricity. To operate our systems, we enter into standard interconnection agreements with applicable utilities. Sales of electricity and non-sale equipment leases by third parties, such as our leases and PPAs, are likely to face regulatory challenges in some states and jurisdictions.
Environmental Regulations
We operate in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which we are subject govern, among others, vehicle emissions and the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, and local level is an important aspect of our ability to continue our operations.
Environmental standards applicable to us are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which we operate, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses issued to us. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and what we anticipate will be increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial administrative, civil or even criminal fines, penalties and possibly orders to cease any violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective works. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses.
EPA Emissions and Certificate of Conformity
The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by CARB certifying that certain of our vehicles comply with all applicable emissions and related certification requirements. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and a CARB Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in California and states that have adopted California’s stricter standards for emissions controls related to new vehicles and engines sold in such states. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the CARB Executive Order for sales of vehicles.
In addition to California, there are a growing number of states that have either adopted or are in the process of adopting the stricter California standards, including New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Colorado.
We are required to seek an EPA Certificate of Conformity for certain of our vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and a CARB Executive Order for vehicles sold in California or any of the other 13 states identified above that have adopted the stricter California standards.
Regulations Pertaining to Our Title Business
Our title companies and related subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under applicable state laws. The laws of most states in which we transact business establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relating to issuing and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, accounting practices, and financial practices. 
In addition to state-level regulation, our title business is subject to regulation by federal agencies, including the CFPB. The CFPB was established under the Dodd-Frank which also included regulation over financial services and other lending related businesses. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate, among other areas, the mortgage and real estate markets in matters pertaining to consumers. This authority includes the enforcement of the TILA, the RESPA and the rules related to the TRID formerly placed with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Our underwritten title companies, primarily those domiciled in California, are also subject to certain regulation by insurance regulatory or other governing authorities relating to their net worth and working capital.
From time to time, we receive inquiries and requests for information from attorneys general, insurance commissioners and other regulatory agencies about various matters relating to our business. Sometimes these take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. We cooperate with all such inquiries. From time to time, we are assessed fines for violations of regulations or other matters or enter into settlements with such authorities which may require us to pay fines or claims or take other actions.
Regulations Regarding our Fintech Businesses
Securities and Commodities Laws
In order for a securities exchange to operate, it must register as a broker-dealer with the SEC and become a member of FINRA. Depending on a securities exchange’s activities, it may be required to also register as a broker dealer on the state level. JUSTLY is a registered broker dealer with an alternative trading system. Depending upon the jurisdiction, we may also be required to comply with laws applicable to securities exchanges.
Financial Crimes and Sanctions Compliance
The jurisdictions in which we operate and intend to operate generally have adopted laws to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other financial crime, as well as to ensure compliance with applicable sanctions regimes. Various aspects of our business require us to develop and implement policies and procedures that confirm the identity of customers, detect suspicious activities and ensure we do not do business with blocked persons.
Rules and Regulations of PRC Material to our Business 
General Regulation of Businesses in the PRC
We are required to obtain government approval from or filing with the SAMR and/or other government agencies in the PRC for transactions, such as our acquisition or disposition of business entities in the PRC. Additionally, foreign ownership of certain business and assets in the PRC is not permitted without specific government approval.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment
Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Negative List and the Encouraged Foreign Investment Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the NDRC. The Catalogue sets forth the industries in which foreign investments are encouraged, while the Negative List sets forth the industries in which foreign investment are restricted, or prohibited. Industries that are not listed in the restricted or prohibited categories are permitted areas for foreign investments and are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Establishment of wholly foreign owned enterprises is generally allowed in encouraged and permitted industries. Foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries in the prohibited category.
The establishment of a wholly foreign owned enterprise must register with the competent administration for market regulation. Our significant PRC subsidiaries have duly obtained all material approvals required for their business operations. The SCNPC enacted the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC on March 15, 2019 and the State Council promulgated the Implementation Regulations of Foreign Investment Law of the PRC on December 26, 2019, both of which came into force on January 1, 2020. On December 30, 2019, the MOFCOM and the SAMR jointly promulgated the Measures on Reporting of Foreign Investment Information, which also became effective on January 1, 2020. Under these laws and regulations, foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises are required to report and update certain investment information to the MOFCOM through the Enterprise 
Registration System and the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System. Any foreign investor or foreign-invested company found to be non-compliant with these reporting obligations may potentially be subject to fines and legal sanctions.
The PRC government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations on existing laws, some of which are not published on a timely basis or may have retroactive effect. Administrative and court proceedings in the PRC may also be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Regulatory risk also encompasses the interpretation by the tax authorities of current tax laws, and our legal structure and scope of operations in the PRC, which could be subject to further restrictions resulting in limitations on our ability to conduct business in the PRC.
PRC Regulations on Automobile Sales
On April 5, 2017, the MOFCOM promulgated the Administrative Measures on Automobile Sales, which became effective on July 1, 2017, pursuant to which automobile suppliers and dealers are required to file with relevant authorities (via an information system for national automobile circulation operated by competent commerce departments) within 90 days after receiving a business license. Where there is any change to a party’s underlying information, automobile suppliers and dealers must update such information within 30 days after such change. Failure to satisfy such filing requirement will be subject to a warning or a fine up to RMB 30,000. 
PRC Regulations on the Recall of Defective Automobiles
On October 22, 2012, the State Council promulgated the Administrative Provisions on Defective Automotive Product Recalls, which became effective on January 1, 2013, and which were amended on March 3, 2019. According to this legislation, the product quality supervision department of the State Council is responsible for the supervision and administration of recalls of defective automotive products in China. Manufacturers of automobile products are required to take measures to eliminate defects in products they sell. A manufacturer must recall all defective automobile products. If any operator conducting sales, leasing, or repair of vehicles discovers any defect in automobile products, it must cease to sell, lease or use the defective products and must assist manufacturers in the recall of those products. 

PRC Regulation Relating to Compulsory Product Certification
According to the Administrative Regulations on Compulsory Product Certification promulgated by the QSIQ (which was subsequently merged into the SAMR) on July 3, 2009 which became effective on September 1, 2009, and was most recently amended on November 1, 2022 by the SAMR, together with the List of the First Batch of Products Subject to Compulsory Product Certification promulgated by the QSIQ in association with the CAA on December 3, 2001, which became effective on the same day and the Compulsory Product Certification Catalogue Description and Definition Form, which was promulgated on April 17, 2007 and was most recently amended on October 10, 2022, the SAMR is responsible for the quality certification of automobiles. Automobiles and relevant accessories must not be sold, exported or used in operating activities until they are certified by relevant certification authorities designated by the CAA as qualified products and granted certification marks. 
PRC Regulations on Consumer Rights Protection
The Consumer Rights and Interests Protection Law, as promulgated on October 31, 1993 and most recently amended in 2013 by the SCNPC, imposes stringent requirements and obligations on business operators in China. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements under this legislation could subject business operators to administrative penalties including warnings, confiscation of unlawful income, imposition of fines, an order to cease business operations, revocation of business licenses, as well as potential civil or criminal liabilities. 
PRC Regulation on Employment 
The Labor Contract Law of the PRC, which was promulgated by the SCNPC on June 29, 2007 and most recently amended as of July 1, 2013, is primarily aimed at regulating rights and obligations of employer and employee relationships, including the establishment, performance and termination of labor contracts. Pursuant to the Labor Contract Law, labor contracts must be concluded in writing if labor relationships are to be or have been established between employers and their employees. Employee wages shall be no lower than local standards on minimum wages and must be paid to employees in a timely manner. Employers are prohibited from forcing employees to work above certain time limits and employers shall pay employees for overtime work in accordance with national regulations. The Labor Contract Law in effect prohibits employers from terminating employees without severance except in a few enumerated circumstances (e.g., serious violation of company rules and regulations). In some permitted circumstances of termination (such as where an employee is incompetent and remains 
incompetent after training or assignment to another post), a 30 days’ prior notice (or pay in lieu) and severance payments are required. 
The Social Insurance Law of the PRC, promulgated by the SCNPC on October 28, 2010 and most recently amended on December 29, 2018, provides that each employer within the PRC must register with the State’s social insurance system upon its establishment and make contributions to the social insurance system for the benefit of each of its employees, including foreign nationals who are employed in the PRC. Specifically, an employer must make monthly deposits to a designated fund for its contribution to each of its employees’ pension insurance, medical insurance, work injury insurance, unemployment insurance, and maternity insurance. Failure to make such deposits according to the amounts and times provided by law can lead to a court order for seizure, freezing, or an auction of the employer’s property equivalent to the value of any unpaid social insurance payables. 
In accordance with the Regulations on the Management of Housing Fund which was promulgated by the State Council on April 3, 1999 and revised on March 24, 2019, employers must register at designated administrative centers and open bank accounts in order to deposit mandatory employee housing fund contributions. Employers are required to pay and deposit housing fund contributions (in an amount no less than 5% of the monthly average salary of the employee in the preceding year) in full and on time. 
PRC Regulation on Government Subsidies
On April 22, 2015, the MOF, the MOST, the MIIT and the NDRC jointly promulgated the Financial Support Circular, which took effect on the same day. The Financial Support Circular provides that those who purchase new energy vehicles specified in the Catalogue of Recommended New Energy Vehicle Models for Promotion and Application issued by the MIIT may enjoy government subsidies. A purchaser may purchase a new energy vehicle from a manufacturer by paying the price deducted by the subsidy amount, and the manufacturer may obtain the subsidy amount from the PRC central government after such new energy vehicle is sold to the purchaser. 
On April 23, 2020, the MOF, the MOST, the MIIT and the NDRC jointly issued the 2020 Financial Subsidies Circular, which took effect on the same day, and which extended the implementation period of financial subsidies for new energy vehicles to the end of 2022. The 2020 Financial Subsidies Circular further specifies that the subsidy criteria for new energy vehicles during the period from year 2020 to 2022 will generally be reduced by 10%, 20% and 30% compared to the subsidy standard of the previous year respectively, and the number of vehicles eligible for the subsidies will not exceed approximately two million each year. 
On December 31, 2020, the above mentioned authorities further promulgated the 2021 Financial Subsidies Circular, a Circular on Further Improving the Financial Subsidy Policy for the Wider Application of New-energy Vehicles, which became effective on January 1, 2021, and was another similar circular to reiterate the principles including among others, the subsidy criteria reduction rate as stipulated in the 2020 Financial Subsidies Circular. This 2021 Financial Subsidies Circular emphasizes that the effective period for financial subsidy policies applicable to new energy vehicles will be extended to the end of 2022, given levels of technical progress, scale effect and other factors. The reduction of these subsidy standards will be gradual. The 2021 subsidy standard reduces the base subsidy amount by 20% for each new energy vehicle on the basis of that for the previous year.
On December 31, 2021, the above mentioned authorities promulgated the 2022 Financial Subsidies Circular, a Circular on Financial Subsidy Policy for Application and Promotion of New-energy Vehicles in the year of 2022, which became effective on January 1, 2022. The 2022 Financial Subsidies Circular specifies that the subsidy standard of 2022 will be reduced by 30% compared to the subsidy standard of the previous year, and the financial subsidy policies applicable to new energy vehicles will expire on December 31, 2022. 
On September 18, 2022, the MOF, MIIT and the State Taxation Administration jointly issued the Circular on Extending the Exemption of Vehicle Purchase Tax for New-energy Vehicles, which has extended vehicle purchase tax exemptions applicable to new energy vehicles until the end of 2023. Any new energy vehicles listed in the New Energy Vehicle Catalogue released by the MIIT and the State Taxation Administration and are purchased from the issuance date of such New Energy Vehicle Catalogue, are exempted from vehicle purchase taxes.
Taxation
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress of the PRC originally passed the EIT Law, which was most recently amended on December 29, 2018, and on November 28, 2007, the State Council of China originally passed implementing rules 
to the EIT Law, which were most recently amended on April 23, 2019. The EIT Law and its implementing rules impose a unified EIT rate of 25.0% on all domestic-invested enterprises and FIE unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions. In addition, under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with “de facto management bodies” within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to an EIT of 25% on its global income. The implementing rules define the term “de facto management bodies” as “an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production, business, personnel, accounting, etc., of a Chinese enterprise.” If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise, then our organization’s global income will be subject to PRC income tax of 25%. 
In April 2009, the State Taxation Administration originally issued a circular, commonly known as “Circular 82,” which was most recently amended on December 29, 2017. Circular 82 provides specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is actually located in China. Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups (not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners,) the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Taxation Administration’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an enterprise incorporated offshore but controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. 
For detailed discussion of PRC tax issues related to resident enterprise status, see Part I-Item 1A-“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in the PRC- Under the EIT Law, we may be classified as a “resident enterprise” of China. Such classification will likely result in dividends payable to our foreign investor and gains on sale of our common stock by our foreign investors may become subject to PRC taxation.”
Foreign Currency Exchange
Under the PRC foreign currency exchange regulations applicable to us, RMB is convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions. Currently, our PRC operating entities may purchase foreign currencies for settlement of current account transactions, including payments of dividends to us, without the approval of the SAFE PRC, by complying with certain procedural requirements. Conversion of RMB for capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, security investment and repatriation of investment, however, is still subject to the approval of the SAFE PRC. In particular, if our PRC operating entities borrow foreign currency through loans from us or other foreign lenders, these loans must be registered with the SAFE PRC, and if we finance the subsidiaries by means of additional capital contributions, these capital contributions must be registered or filed with by certain government authorities. These limitations could affect our PRC operating entities’ ability to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financing.
Dividend Distributions
PRC regulations restrict the ability of our PRC entities to make dividends and other payments to their offshore parent company. PRC legal restrictions permit payments of dividends by our PRC entities only out of their accumulated after-tax profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Each of our PRC subsidiaries is also required under PRC laws and regulations to allocate at least 10% of our annual after-tax profits determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the PRC to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Our PRC subsidiaries have the discretion to allocate a portion of their after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, which may not be distributed to equity owners except in the event of liquidation.
In addition, under the EIT Law, the Notice 112 which was originally issued on January 29, 2008 and most recently amended on February 29, 2008, any dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries paid to us through our entities are (since January 1, 2008) subject to a withholding tax at a rate of 10%. Furthermore, the ultimate tax rate will be determined by treaty between the PRC and the tax residence nation of the holder of the PRC subsidiary. Dividends historically declared and paid before January 1, 2008 on distributable profits were grandfathered in under the EIT Law and were not subject to withholding tax.
We intend to reinvest profits, if any, and do not intend on making cash distributions of dividends in the near future.
The Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.
We are subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries and vice versa. Many jurisdictions have passed laws regarding data privacy and personal data, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.
The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal and business information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as vehicle telematics data and financial data. Vehicle telematics are subject to specific regulation by the PRC, and if the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations in the PRC or elsewhere, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.
