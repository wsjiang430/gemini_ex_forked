ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Except as otherwise indicated herein or as the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report to “Bubblr,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Bubblr, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Bubblr Limited and Bubblr Holdings Limited, which are a non-trading company and IP holding company, respectively, both formed and existing in the United Kingdom.
 
Overview
 
Bubblr, Inc is a company founded on the principles of digital disruption, innovation and the emerging importance of ethical internet applications. We call this emergent global movement, the “Ethical Web.”
 
The 5 pillars of the Ethical Web are:
 

• | An internet that decentralizes profits; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------
• | An internet that consecrates citizens’ rights to privacy; 
• | An internet that levels the playing field for businesses; 
• | An internet that combats social and cultural division; and 
• | An internet that is not corrupted by advertising. 

Bubblr’s Mission
 
Our goal is to fix a broken internet model that currently suffers from the following failures:
 

1. | Systematic abuse of an individual’s personal data;
---+---------------------------------------------------


2. | Prohibitively expensive and complex businesses marketing channels for SMEs; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | A lack of financial incentives to develop and sustain new internet economic models.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Bubblr brings a holistic approach to the above problems in a fundamentally unique way. Building on its patented alternative online search mechanism and engaging with the global digital developer community, we plan to build a new economic platform that we believe will be sustainable and fair to users, online businesses, and all online stakeholders. Our mission is twofold:
  

1) | Empower the developers of a new Internet in creating Ethical Technologies both through in-house Intellectual Property, and by providing advanced digital tools that enable developers and creators to build fair-forward solutions to build a new Ethical Internet Ecosystem on the Ethical Web, and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Acquire/Commercialize/Invest in Ethical Web products and services developed on our global platform and/or with corporate partners.

Open-Code Ecosystem
 
Understanding that the Ethical Web concept is larger than any one entity, requiring various layers of technologies across multiple business sectors. We are building an Open-Code Platform (OCP) to engage and incentivize the world’s developers and engineers in our mission for a more equitable internet, at the DNA level.


With our own intellectual property at its core, we will endeavor to construct our OCP with economic incentives for the developer community in mind, incorporating a number of related digital tools that support the ethical development of new mobile applications that adhere to and reflect the highest standards of the Ethical Web. 
 
We believe that our software as a service (SAAS) Open-Code Platform will allow the open-source community, companies and not-for-profit organizations to be able to build their own mobile applications using templates downloadable from a central code repository. We intend to focus on Low-Code and No-Code applications as much as possible to attract a larger pool of developers. As partners register with our platform, they are provisioned with online dashboards that allow them to utilize the SAAS platform fully and will have their own sandbox provisioned to test their apps.
 
Mobile-First
 
All of the consumer-based products subsequently developed by our registered partners are designed to deliver the presentation layer through mobile-first consumer experiences.
 
While we are a mobile-first company, we understand the need for flexibility in order to maximize market penetration. To this end, we plan to develop relationships with the new wave of security-first browsers such as Brave, TOR and others.
 
Monetization and Market-Making
 
We are developing our platform by concentrating on proven value methodologies designed to exponentially increase the adoption of our IP through the following four-tiered process:
 

1. | Research, Development and Commercialization. We are creating an Open-Code Initiative designed to evolve our IP (developed under patent) as well as that of our partners and future potential acquisitions. This should allow us to identify growth areas and expand ecosystems, platforms, and products within those areas, positioning us for commercialization opportunities across a wide range of business sectors.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Licensing and SAAS. We plan to provide revenue opportunities through partnerships with selected start-ups and established corporations to further our reach and rapid development of platform applications. The SAAS platform will allow low volume, free community access. However, platform usage is metered, and those partners who start using the platform for larger volume will be obliged to pay an appropriate license fee.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Venture Funding. We plan to license or otherwise provide our technology to selected start-ups, teams and developers, and fund early stage startups that develop promising applications arising from the platform. This should allow us to grow a multi-sector ecosystem and maximize reach and revenues through multiple streams.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced Tools and Future Services
 
We have developed a data-driven conversations (DDC) capability that is in the process of being implemented into our platform and app technologies. This generic application can be used by developers with access to our toolkit and will allow Bubblr to build and alter conversation search dialogues to optimize searching for information and content.
 
Additionally, we are building complex AI and machine learning to optimize search results regarding relevance and salience for searching for critical information. Our plans include adding these algorithms to the Open-Code platform and development ecosystems and to our overall Software Development Kit (SDK).
 
The systems architecture to support these innovations continues to evolve and our plan is designed to evolve with it. Our belief is that a collection of technologies, geared to incentivize developed and create multiple revenue streams for Bubblr, is the perfect strategy to create exponential value for our company and significantly enhance our shareholders’ interests.

Intellectual Property
 
We have created a new search mechanism ‘AN INTERNET-BASED SEARCH MECHANISM’, which has been granted a patent in South Africa (2016/06947), New Zealand (725014), the United States of America (‘Utility Patent No. US 10977387), Canada (2962520), Australia (2015248619) and we have patents pending on the same processes in the European Union (15723990.6) and the United Kingdom (PCT/GB2015/051130), creating an alternative economic ecosystem to tackle the current broken model and better serve all main participant groups.
 
Bubblr has filed a sister patent to our approved INTERNET SEARCH MECHANISM. This patent entitled “Contextual Enveloping Via Dynamically Generated Hyperlinking.” (US Patent Application No. 17/980,298) will define an alternative mobile search system purely for information rather than goods and service, which our original patent covers. This new search mechanism is designed to change the way search is conducted for information and will bear little resemblance to the established search model. 
 
Competition
 The space for online marketplaces and ad networks is rapidly evolving. The Advertising Technology (Ad-tech) industry includes all kinds of tools, software platforms (Google, Facebook), agencies, data-brokers, etc. It facilitates targeted advertisements that have become exponentially more invasive over the past decade due to massive amounts of personal data collection. It's a complex and opaque ecosystem that tracks, profiles, discriminates (both personal and business) and manipulates for profit. It's a multi-billion-dollar industry that is now facing litigation, investigations, and new regulations to curb its practices.
 
We face intense competition from companies with much larger capital resources than us, and, as a result, we could struggle to attract users and gain market share. Many of our existing or future competitors have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and, as a result, may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole. We will strive to advance our technology in each of these sectors ahead of our competitors to gain market share. We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate our existing employees and to compensate employees competitively. We face significant competition in several aspects of our business, and such competition might increase, particularly in the market for networks and online marketplaces. A key advantage against better resourced competitors is provisioning our technology and related acquisitions as an Open Source SAAS platform. This pushes all of the consumer and merchant marketing responsibility to the registered partners. 
 
Our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better address changing industry standards or the needs of users, such as mobile access or different market focus. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of business or decreased user activity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. 
 
We believe that we have competitive strengths and protection via our IP which is defensible under the umbrella protection of our granted patents. 
 
 Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business online, many of which are evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and abroad, laws and regulations relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, or the content provided by users. Further, some countries impose regulations regarding or require licenses to conduct various aspects of our business, including employee recruiting and news related services. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users or other third parties could harm our business. In addition, rising concern about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct, such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information, money laundering or supporting terrorist activities, may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our website platform, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our platform.

In the area of information security and data protection, most states have enacted laws and regulations requiring notification to users when there is a security breach of personal data or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may increase in the future as a result of amendments or changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities.
 
We are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and protection of data. Our privacy policies describe our practices concerning the use, storage, transmission and disclosure of personal information, including visitor and user data. Any failure by us to comply with these terms or privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations and their application to online services are unclear, evolving and in a state of flux. For example, in October 2015, the highest court in the European Union invalidated reliance on the US-EU Safe Harbor regime as one of the legally recognized mechanisms under which the personal data of European citizens could be transferred to the United States. There is a risk that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices or that new laws or regulations will be enacted. In addition, because our platform will be accessible worldwide, certain foreign governments may claim that we are required to comply with their laws and regulations, including with respect to the storage, use and disclosure of user information, even in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure. Complying with these varying domestic and international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.
 
Employees
 
As of March 28, 2023, we have 5 full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any labor union.


Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we may become party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party, as plaintiff or defendant, to any legal proceedings that we believe to be material or which, individually or in the aggregate, would be expected to have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation if determined adversely to us.
Smaller Reporting Company
 
The Company is a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. There are certain exemptions available to us as a smaller reporting company, including: (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act; (2) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (3) the requirement to provide only two years of audited financial statements, instead of three years. As long as we maintain our status as a “smaller reporting company,” these exemptions will continue to be available to us.
Available Information
 
We make available, free of charge, on or through our website, at www.bubblr.com our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes our audited financial statements, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The SEC maintains a website that contains these reports and other information at www.sec.gov. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be, and are not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
