ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General



We are primarily a supplier of original designed and manufactured (ODM) products that include value-added engineering and turn-key solutions. We focus on providing original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and contract electronic manufacturers (CEMs) with ODM products for their multi-year turn-key projects (“ODM Projects”) and ODM electronic components (“ODM Components”). Our product offerings range from discrete semiconductors through small electronic devices. We also distribute brand name electronic components with a vast inventory available on hand. We are incorporated in California and were originally formed in 1989. We maintain two (2) divisions, in Taiwan and China.



Our Taiwan and China locations provide support for inventory sourcing, purchases and coordinating the manufacture of our ODM Projects and ODM Components (collectively we refer to these as “ODM Products”). In 2022 and 2021, we offered approximately 59 and 83, respectively, different ODM Products that are manufactured to specifications developed as a result of our engineering support services. Our China location also serves as the engineering center responsible for making component datasheets and test specifications, arranging pre-production and mass production at our manufacturer partners, preparing samples, monitoring the quality of shipments, performing failure analysis reports, and designing circuits with partners for ODM Projects.



We have also developed a reputation for stocking a large selection of electronic component inventories to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers. At December 31, 2022, our inventory consisted of approximately 12,000 different products manufactured by more than 100 different suppliers. However, our core strategy has shifted to primarily focus on our ODM Products that require custom products designed for specific applications to OEM customers, and away from actively marketing our superstore strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory.



ODM Projects



Our ODM Projects are custom made and are marketed in specific industries such as: wild animal feeders, timers for DC motors, public street light controllers, LED modules for swimming pools and water fountain lights, LED headlamps for vacuum cleaners, battery testers, universal remote-control devices and battery chargers.



Our distribution of ODM Projects originates from our 50,000 square-foot facility located in Valencia, California. We utilize a computerized inventory control/tracking system which enables us to quickly access inventory levels and trace product shipments. See Item 2 - “Properties.”

ODM Product Industry



ODM product providers have experienced rapid change and growth as an increasing number of OEMs outsource their manufacturing requirements. OEMs have continued to turn to outsourcing in order to reduce product cost; achieve accelerated time-to-market and time-to-volume production; access advanced design and manufacturing technologies; improve inventory management and purchasing power; and reduce their capital investment in manufacturing resources. This enables OEMs to concentrate on what they believe to be their core strengths, such as new product definition, design, marketing and sales. We believe further growth opportunities exist for ODM product providers to penetrate the worldwide market. By designing private brand products for our domestic OEM customers, we are able to expand export sales to overseas CEM customers.
ODM Products Strategy



We offer value-added ODM products to our existing OEM and CEM customers utilizing our engineering design center in Shanghai, China. The sales of our ODM Products were $8,282,000 and $8,434,000 in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Strategic allies such as Teamforce Co. Ltd., Grand Shine Management and Zowie Technology Corporation (see Part II, Item 8: Note 5 – Other Assets) provide us with engineering support services in our ODM projects in order to lower costs and to shorten the design cycle.



By offering application engineering service to current customers, we are often involved in reviewing their bill of materials (BOMs) and circuit diagrams. Based upon their credit history, type of products, production volume, profitability of the industry and circuit schematics, we offer different solutions for quality improvement, additional functions and cost savings throughout the re-design processes such as component replacement, digital circuit instead of analog circuit, microprocessor instead of logic circuit, integrated circuit instead of discrete components. Our preference is to target low but increasing volume, high margin, stable demand, profitable and specialty products, and financially stable customers who know how to market their products. Our strengths are in microprocessor programming, power supply, power management, LED message sign, RF transmission and receiving, encoders and decoders, remote controllers, DC motor control and power amplifiers. In many cases, we have been able to take advantage of our component distribution capability by using current stock to reduce lead time and choosing the low-cost components we currently sell. We depend on our outsourcing partners in mold design, plastic injection, metal stamping, wire hardness and final assembly. We ask between 15% to 30% down payment before accepting a purchase order and offer customers 30 to 60 days payment terms. All purchasing orders must have a firm delivery schedule under a non-cancelable and non-returnable (NCNR) agreement. To reduce the manufacturing and handling cost, we arrange production of the same model once a year and keep product in our warehouse to be released according to the predetermined schedule.



“Superstore” Marketing Strategy Change



Since 1997, we have marketed ourselves as the “discrete components superstore,” with an in-depth focus on discrete semiconductors, passive and optoelectronic components and extensive inventory of a wide variety of these products. Our “superstore” strategy consists of carrying a large quantity and variety of components in inventory to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers. Our core strategy has shifted to primarily focus on our ODM Products that require custom services designed for specific applications to OEM customers, and away from actively marketing our “superstore” strategy of maintaining a vast quantity of electronic components to fill customer orders immediately from available stock held in inventory. We will continue offering our existing wide variety of components for resale, but these products will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our website shopping portal, instead of actively through traditional sales agents and distributors.
Customers



We market our ODM products to OEMs and our electronic components inventory to distributors, OEMs and CEMs. During each of 2022 and 2021, we distributed our products to approximately 200 customers, however our two largest customers combined accounted for approximately 70% (individually by approximately 46% and 24%) of net sales during 2022 and approximately 59% (individually by approximately 41% and 18%) during 2021.



We believe that exceptional customer service and customer relations are key elements of our success, and train our sales force to provide prompt, efficient and courteous service to all customers. See “Business - Sales and Marketing Channels.” We have the ability to ship most orders the same day they are placed and, historically, most of our customers’ orders have been shipped within the requested delivery schedule.

Sales and Marketing Channels



As of March 15, 2023, our sales and marketing department consisted of 6 employees. We have centralized our sales order processing and customer service department into our headquarters at Valencia, California.



As a result of our marketing strategy change to focus primarily on ODM Products and away from our superstore inventory, we expect our remaining components inventory will be more passively marketed and distributed online for clearance through our internet sales portal, however at potentially lower rates due to the pricing pressures normally attributed with online shopping.



Suppliers



In connection with our ODM products, we have built strong collaborative relationships with a few selected system integration companies in China. These strategic relationships ensure the quality of the products and services and also provide a warranty on our finished products. Most of the projects involve multiple years of cooperation among components suppliers, overseas partners and the end customers in the US, and therefore, increase business stability and reduce the financial risk of excess inventory.



We believe that it’s important to develop and maintain good relationships with our discrete electronic component suppliers, since we do not have long-term supply, distribution or franchise agreements with any of our suppliers. Instead, we cultivate strong working relationships with each of our suppliers.



Competition



The ODM products we provide are available from many independent sources as well as from the in-house manufacturing capabilities of current and potential customers. Our competitors may be more established in the industry and have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, or marketing resources than we do. In addition, in recent years, original design manufacturers that provide design and manufacturing services to OEMs have significantly increased their share of outsourced manufacturing services provided to OEMs in the consumer electronic product market. Competition from ODMs may increase if our business in these markets grows or if ODMs expand further into these markets. We believe that our principal competitive advantages in our targeted markets are our engineering capabilities, product quality, flexibility, cost and timeliness in responding to design and schedule changes, reliability in meeting product delivery schedules, pricing, technological sophistication and geographic location.



We operate our discrete electronic components business online in a highly competitive environment and face competition from numerous local, regional and national distributors (both in purchasing and selling inventory) and electronic component manufacturers, including some of our own suppliers. Many of our competitors are more established and have greater name recognition and financial and marketing resources than us.



Management Information Systems



We have made a significant investment in computer hardware, software and personnel. The Management Information Systems (MIS) department is responsible for software and hardware upgrades, maintenance of current software and related databases, and designing custom systems. We believe that our MIS department is crucial to our success and believe in continually upgrading our hardware and software. We also developed a vendor management inventory software program which allows participating customers to access and manage their own inventory through the internet. The web site also provides users with other current information about us.
Warehouse Management System



We utilize a wireless, fully bar-coded warehouse perpetual inventory tracking system that greatly enhances the processing speed, accuracy of product quantity and location control within the warehouse. It also reduces potential errors and accelerates the delivery of components to our customers. We continuously improve our warehouse management system with custom programming features.
Foreign Trade Regulation



A large portion of the products we distribute are manufactured in Asia, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines. The purchase of goods manufactured in foreign countries is subject to a number of risks, including economic disruptions, including the ongoing consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, transportation delays and interruptions, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, imposition of tariffs and import and export controls, and changes in governmental policies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Sales to Asian customers were 3.6% and 9.8% of our total sales in 2022 and 2021, respectively.



From time to time, protectionist pressures have influenced U.S. trade policy concerning the imposition of significant duties or other trade restrictions upon foreign products. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. customs quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign components in the future or what effect any of these actions would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. During 2022, we remained impacted by tariff costs on certain products imported from China, which went into effect as of July 6, 2018. However, we also have been able to pass along a portion of these costs to our customers to mitigate these costs.



Our ability to remain competitive with respect to the pricing of imported components could be adversely affected by increases in tariffs or duties, changes in trade treaties, strikes in air or sea transportation, and possible future U.S. legislation with respect to pricing and import quotas on products from foreign countries. For example, it is possible that political or economic developments in China, or with respect to the United States’ relationship with China, could have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to remain competitive also could be affected by other governmental actions related to, among other things, anti-dumping legislation and international currency fluctuations. While we do not believe that any of these factors adversely impact our business at present, we cannot assure that these factors will not materially adversely affect us in the future. Any significant disruption in the delivery of merchandise from our suppliers, substantially all of whom are foreign, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.



Employees



As of March 15, 2023, we had 15 employees, all of whom are employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with employees to be good.
