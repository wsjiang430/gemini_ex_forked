Our experienced management team brings with it a track record of delivering new drug approvals for products for diseases such as migraine, depression, bipolar and schizophrenia. We are advancing a pipeline of therapies for diseases with little or no treatment options, leveraging our proven drug development capabilities and proprietary platforms, including Kv7 ion channel modulation for epilepsy and neuronal hyperexcitability, glutamate modulation for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (“OCD”) and Spinocerebellar Ataxia ("SCA"), myostatin inhibition for neuromuscular diseases, and brain-penetrant Tyrosine Kinase 2/Janus Kinase 1 ("TYK2/JAK1") inhibition for immune-mediated brain disorders. Our portfolio of early- and late-stage product candidates also includes discovery research programs focused on TRPM3 channel activation for neuropathic pain, CD-38 antibody recruiting, bispecific molecules for multiple myeloma, antibody drug conjugates ("ADCs"), and extracellular target degrader platform technology ("MoDE") with potential application in neurological disorders, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.
We are advancing our broad and diverse pipeline, across early and late stage development, including three Phase 3 clinical programs. We have built a highly experienced team of senior leaders and neuroscience drug developers who combine a nimble, results-driven biotech mindset with capabilities in drug discovery and development. In addition, we have several preclinical assets in our early discovery program, targeting indications in neuroscience and immunology.
Separation from Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd.
On May 9, 2022, the Board of Directors of Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (the “Former Parent”) approved and directed Former Parent’s management to effect the spin-off of the Kv7 ion channel activators, glutamate modulation and myostatin inhibition platforms, preclinical product candidates, and certain corporate infrastructure then owned by Former Parent, or collectively the “Biohaven Business”. 
On October 3, 2022, the Former Parent completed the distribution (the “Distribution”) to holders of its common shares of all of the outstanding common shares of Biohaven Ltd. and the spin-off of Biohaven Ltd. from the Former Parent (the “Spin-Off”) described in Biohaven’s Information Statement attached as Exhibit 99.1 to Biohaven’s Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended (Reg. No. 001-41477), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on September 22, 2022 (the “Form 10”). Each holder of Former Parent common shares received one common share of Biohaven for every two of the Former Parent common shares held of record as of the close of business on September 26, 2022. To implement the Spin-Off, the Former Parent transferred the related license agreements, intellectual property and the Former Parent’s corporate infrastructure, including certain non-commercial employee agreements, share-based awards and other corporate agreements to Biohaven Ltd.
Collectively, we refer to the Distribution and Spin-Off throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the "Separation." As a result of the Separation, Biohaven Ltd. is an independent, publicly traded company, effective as of October 3, 2022, and commenced regular way trading under the symbol “BHVN”’ on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on October 4, 2022. Where we describe historical business activities in this report, we do so as if Former Parent’s activities related to such assets and liabilities had been performed by the Company.
Product Candidates
The following table summarizes some of our key clinical programs in addition to upcoming clinical development milestones for our product candidates. We hold the worldwide rights to all of our product candidates.
Kv7
Kv7 Platform Acquisition
In February 2022, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with Channel Biosciences, LLC, a subsidiary of Knopp Biosciences, LLC, to acquire a drug discovery platform targeting Kv7 ion channels, adding the latest advances in ion channel modulation to our growing neuroscience portfolio. BHV-7000 (formerly known as KB-3061), the lead asset from the Kv7 platform is an activator of Kv7.2/Kv7.3, a key ion channel involved in neuronal signaling and in regulating the hyperexcitable state in epilepsy. In the second quarter of 2022, our Clinical Trial Application for BHV-7000 was approved by Health Canada, and we subsequently began phase 1 clinical development, including a SAD/MAD study. The Company is evaluating and has not yet finalized potential future clinical trial designs, including trial size, and primary and secondary endpoints and expects to initiate an EEG study in the first half of 2023 and expects to initiate phase 2/3 studies in focal epilepsy patients and bipolar disorder patients in the second half of 2023. 
Kv7’s Role in Epilepsy and Other Central Nervous System Disorders
Epilepsy
Because of their fundamental role in health and their aberrant role in disease, ion channels in cell membranes represent a broad and important class of drug targets. Sodium channels and potassium channels form the ionic basis of the action potential in electrically charged cells throughout the body (see figures below). The Kv7 protein in particular forms a channel that exquisitely regulates the flow of charged potassium ions (K+) across cell membranes, repolarizing nerve cells and resetting them for normal action potential firing. Kv7 channels include a family of channel subtypes, designated as Kv7.1 through Kv7.5, and they are formed by tetramers of identical or compatible subunits. Some of these channel subtypes localize in nerve cells (neurons) while others can be found in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and other tissue types. 
The Kv7 subunits, Kv7.2 and Kv7.3, are widely expressed in the brain, notably in the cortex and hippocampus, and together they form Kv7.2/7.3 heteromeric channels that produce the M-current (IKM), a critical regulator of neuronal excitability (see figures below). Kv7.2/7.3 channels normally perform a natural “braking” function by regulating the electrical excitability and hyperexcitability of brain cells. Dysfunction of these channels, due to genetic mutations or other factors, increases seizure risk, while augmenting the ‘open’ activity of these channels has been demonstrated to reduce 
neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure frequency in electrophysiology laboratories, in animal models, and, most importantly, in patients.

White, Role of Potassium Channel Ions in Epilepsy, Medscape.org

We are synthesizing novel Kv7.2/7.3 activators that improve on the selectivity, potency, and other characteristics of ezogabine (Potiga in the U.S. and Trobalt (retigabine) in Europe), a drug approved in 2011 for the treatment of refractory epilepsy and voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2017 because of poor tolerability and structure-related toxicities that limited its use, and ezogabine-like compounds while averting its negative attributes, including off-target activity at a different brain ion channel, gamma-aminobutyric acid (“GABA”) A receptor (“GABAA-R”). 
Using a structure-based approach, supplemented by in silico modeling, we have identified structural features of our molecules critical to Kv7 activation. We have applied these analyses to the generation of proprietary chemical leads structurally distinct from known Kv7 activators, including ezogabine and flupirtine, the only other approved Kv7 modulator, approved in Europe for the treatment of acute pain. Our team has synthesized a large library of Kv7-activating molecules and are advancing them according to stringent criteria requiring improvements over ezogabine, including chemical stability, synthetic tractability, the avoidance of structural motifs associated with the generation of reactive metabolites and other unwanted, off-target activity, including GABAA-R activation.
Epilepsy is the initial disease we are targeting with activators from our Kv7 platform. Epilepsy affects approximately 3.5 million Americans, or more than 1.2% of adults and 0.6% of children in the U.S., and more than 50 million patients worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (“WHO”). It is the fourth most common neurological disorder, and many patients struggle to achieve freedom from seizures, with more than one third of patients requiring two or more medications to manage their epilepsy. While the use of anti-seizure medications is often accompanied by dose-limiting side effects, our clinical candidate BHV-7000 is specifically designed to target subtypes of Kv7 potassium channels without engagement of GABAA receptors. The lack of GABAA-R activity potentially gives BHV-7000 a wide therapeutic window and is expected to result in an improved side effect profile, limiting the somnolence and fatigue often seen in patients receiving anti-seizure medications. This preclinical profile is supported by preliminary safety data from our Phase 1 SAD/MAD trial of BHV-7000 in healthy volunteers, which showed a favorable CNS tolerability profile. By adding BHV-7000 to our pipeline, we aim to bring this potassium channel modulator as a potential solution to patients with epilepsy who remain uncontrolled on their current regimens.
BHV-7000 is a Kv7.2/7.3 channel activator from a novel, bicyclic imidazole class with significant in vivo anticonvulsant activity and a wide therapeutic index. In the most widely used and positively-predictive preclinical model of epilepsy, the maximal electroshock (“MES”) model, data for BHV-7000 and ezogabine were collected in independent experiments (see figures below), measuring the activity of both compounds in preventing seizures (ED50) and recording the neurologic deficit five minutes prior to the MES test to calculate the tolerability index (“TI”). The neurologic deficit is a behavioral index ranging from normal activity (score of 0) to a loss of righting reflex (score of 3). As shown below, BHV-7000 was demonstrated to have an ED50 = 0.5 mg/kg with almost no impact on behavior producing a TI > 40x. In contrast, ezogabine was 40x less potent (ED50 = 20 mg/kg) in the MES model with a narrow TI < 3x. The narrow preclinical TI for ezogabine is consistent with the clinical experience with the drug where side effects such as somnolence and dizziness limited its use at doses that prevented seizures in patients. 
KCNQ2 Epileptic Encephalopathy
KCNQ2 epileptic encephalopathy (“KCNQ2-EE”) is a rare pediatric epileptic encephalopathy first described in 2012 resulting from dominant-negative mutations in the KCNQ2 gene. Epileptic encephalopathies (“EE”) comprise a group of epilepsy syndromes in which onset of recurrent and medically refractory seizures are associated with cognitive and broader developmental delay or regression. Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, also called Ohtahara syndrome, and early myoclonic encephalopathy are the earliest-presenting of these age-dependent syndromes, clinically defined by onset within the first three months after birth. Although only recently described, heterozygous de novo variants in KCNQ2 are a highly validated cause of early onset epileptic encephalopathy, and KCNQ2-EE has emerged as a well-defined clinical entity with a characteristic neonatal presentation, including hypotonia, treatment-resistant tonic seizures, a profoundly abnormal interictal electroencephalogram (“EEG”) with prominent burst-suppression, and most often with moderate-to-profound global developmental delay, resulting from a defined subset of missense variants in the gene. KCNQ2-EE is thus both a seizure disorder and a developmental disorder caused by pathogenic, dominant-negative KCNQ2 mutations.
Identification of genetic etiologies has created the opportunity to treat not just the symptoms of KCNQ2-EE, including seizures, but also the underlying causes, including attenuating or reversing the effects of the dominant-negative variants responsible for KCNQ2-EE. Developmental delay is an intractable feature of KCNQ2-EE even though seizure frequency tends to diminish after infancy and EEG organization tends to improve. Importantly, limited clinical evidence, including a case series of four infants with KCNQ2-EE, suggests that pharmacological augmentation of reduced Kv7.2 channel current with ezogabine reduces seizures and may improve developmental milestone attainment.
Severe pathogenic KCNQ2 mutations disrupt the function of the KCNQ2 gene product, Kv7.2, a voltage-gated potassium channel subunit which, in addition to being a critical regulator of neuronal excitability, plays a fundamental role in early brain development. Kv7.2 polypeptides are co-assembled in either homotetrameric channels, or, in combination with Kv7.3 subunits, to form heterotetrameric channels. Both subunit configurations contribute to IKM. Significant reduction of Kv7.2/7.2 activity or Kv7.2/7.3 activity with loss of 50% of more of current density through these channels abrogate these functions, leading to neuronal hyperexcitability and impaired brain development.
In addition to its activity in the MES model, we explored the ability of BHV-7000 to reverse the reduced current density associated with KCNQ2-EE and support its use as potential treatment for the disease. Most encephalopathy-associated pathogenic KCNQ2 variants identified to date disrupt channel function in any of four distinct “hot spots” of the protein, including the S4 voltage sensor, the ion channel pore, and the proximal and distal regions of the C-terminal domain (see figure below). 

Millichap, Neurol Genet (2016)

To determine the effects of BHV-7000 on the function of Kv7.2 and Kv7.2/7.3 channels poisoned by dominant-negative KCNQ2 mutations, four highly recurrent human missense variants representative of the “hot spot” domains were introduced into KCNQ2 cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. Using lipid-mediated transfection, plasmids including the pathogenic variants were co-expressed with wild-type (“wt”) KCNQ2 subunits or wt KCNQ2 and wt KCNQ3 subunits in Chinese hamster ovary cells. 
The figure below shows the effects of BHV-7000 on current density of wt/wt Kv7.2 channels and those formed by 1:1 coexpression of wt KCNQ2 genes with either of two KCNQ2 pore domain variants (T274M, A294V), a C-terminal variant (R581L), or a voltage-sensing variant (R210H). In the control condition, all pathogenic variants produced a marked reduction in current density to below wt/wt levels. BHV-7000 at 0.3µM restored current density in mutated pore and C-terminal channels to or beyond wt control current density (**<0.01). Similarly, application of BHV-7000 at 1 µM restores function to mutated channels expressing the R210H KCNQ2 S4 voltage sensor domain pathogenic variant in the heterotetrameric (wt/R210H) configuration, to above wt/wt levels of activation.
BHV-7000 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for the treatment of KCNQ2-EE.
Neuropathic Pain
Neuropathic pain, as defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain, is pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system and includes a collection of heterogeneous conditions that are often chronic and debilitating and for which long term therapy is difficult. In the United States, over 30 million adults are estimated to be living with neuropathic pain. Pharmacological treatments for neuropathic pain vary according to patient needs, although recommendations such as the WHO analgesic ladder, United States Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”), and FDA guidelines are in use. Initial or first line treatment for neuropathic pain includes non-opioid analgesics, in particular, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, steroids, and anxiolytics. Second line treatment of persistent, severe pain 
may require escalation to opiates, often less potent ones at first, followed by more potent opiates for intense refractory pain. 
Thus, an urgent need exists for effective, non-addictive pain therapies. Flupirtine, a non-selective Kv7 activator, was previously approved in several European countries and indicated for the treatment of pain. However, the European Medicines Agency recommended withdrawal of its marketing authorization in 2018 because of the risk of serious liver injury. Selective Kv7 potassium channel activators represent a new approach in the development of non-opioid therapeutic options for neuropathic pain. In addition to leveraging reduced abuse and addiction risk potential of potassium channel activators, our Kv7 potassium channel platform addresses the complexities of channel subtype physiology through targeted pharmacology to overcome the limitations inherent in unbiased Kv7 activators and is intended to deliver a well-tolerated, highly effective, non-opioid treatment for neuropathic pain.
Our Kv7 program research was supported in part with funding from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to advance the development of novel Kv7 non-opioid therapies for the treatment of chronic pain. The NIH funding is by the NIH Helping to End Addiction Long-term Initiative (“NIH HEAL Initiative”), which aims to improve treatments for chronic pain, curb the rates of opioid use disorder and overdose, and achieve long-term recovery from opioid addiction.The goal of our Kv7 program is to discover a small-molecule activator of the Kv7.2/7.3 voltage-gated potassium channel to treat neuropathic pain. Similar to our epilepsy program, we are targeting compounds with these characteristics:
•Biased for Kv7.2/3 activation vs. Kv7.4 activation to minimize potential adverse smooth muscle effects
•Selective against GABAA receptors to minimize potential tolerability issues
•Selective against Kv7.1/KCNE1 (IKs) and hERG (IKr) to minimize cardiac side-effects
•Potent and effective across animal models of neuropathic pain 
A fundamental program hypothesis is that creating Kv7.2/3 activators with minimal activation of Kv7.4 and GABAA receptors will greatly improve the tolerability profile of a successful candidate compound. Ezogabine has known effects on the GABA system, both directly as a GABAA positive allosteric modulator, and indirectly by affecting GABA synthesis or metabolism, a pharmacology consistent with the dose-related increases in somnolence and dizziness reported in ezogabine clinical trials. Our program is directed to reducing this potential source of poor tolerability by selecting compounds with no or minimal activity for the GABAA receptor.
Axonal excitability and neurotransmitter release are altered in neuropathic pain due to sodium channel plasticity, increased voltage-gated calcium channels in the spinal cord, and diminished potassium channel activity in dorsal root ganglion (“DRG”) neurons. These changes in ion channel number, distribution, and function are common to many neuropathic pain subtypes. The functional density of Kv7.2/3 channels is a key variable governing sensory DRG control of intrinsic excitability. There are some reports that demonstrate downregulation of Kv7 potassium channel mRNA, protein and function in experimental neuropathic pain models. 
Using human induced pluripotent stem cell (“iPSC”)-derived DRG sensory neurons, we have assessed the physiological activity of these neurons by modulating Kv7 channels across three electrophysiologic parameters: resting membrane potential (Vm), rheobase = the current required to stimulate an action potential (“AP”), and the number of APs elicited by a suprathreshold stimulus (3x rheobase). We are currently evaluating the activity of various compounds from our proprietary series of selective Kv7.2/7.3 activators in multiple preclinical models of neuropathic pain.
Mood disorders
Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. are living with neuropsychiatric illnesses that are, in turn, associated with inadequate treatment, poor quality of life, disability, and considerable direct and indirect costs. There is significant unmet need for novel and effective therapeutic options that are not limited by long latency periods to clinical effects, low response rates, and significant risks and side effects. Increasing evidence from animal models and clinical trials now suggests that Kv7.2/7.3 targeting drugs offer the potential to treat a spectrum of these neuropsychiatric diseases including, but not limited to, mood disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and anxiety.
Bipolar disorder is the initial mood disorder that we intend to target with activators from our Kv7 platform. Bipolar disorder affects approximately 7-11 million Americans, with an estimated 4.4% of US adults having bipolar disorder over their lifetime. Bipolar disorder is associated with significant morbidity, decreased quality of life and economic burden. Treatment guidelines recommend patients receive life-long treatment for bipolar disorder. However, medication adherence is typically very low in this population, due in large part to undesirable side effects that are poorly tolerated by patients. The mainstays of treatment include mood stabilizing agents that are also used as anti-seizure medicines (i.e., valproic acid, lamotrigine, and topiramate). Preclinical and pilot clinical data similarly suggest a potential therapeutic role for Kv7 activation in bipolar disorder, which is expected to result in an improved side effect profile compared to other anti-
seizure medications. We plan to advance BHV-7000 as a potential treatment for patients with bipolar disorder and intend to start a clinical trial targeting this indication by the end of 2023.
BHV-7010
BHV-7010 is being developed as a next generation Kv7.2/7.3 activator with improved selectivity over Kv7.4 and differentiated absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion ("ADME") properties that provide flexibility for the treatment of different neurological diseases. The IND is expected to be submitted in the second half of 2023. 
TYK2/JAK1
Agreement with Hangzhou Highlightll Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. 
In March 2023, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide (excluding People’s Republic of China and its territories and possessions) license agreement with Hangzhou Highlightll Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. ("Highlightll") (the "Highlightll Agreement"), whereby we obtained the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize Highlightll’s brain penetrant dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitor program. Refer to 15, "Subsequent Events," of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the Highlightll Agreement.
BHV-8000
Dysregulation of the immune system has been implicated in several neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders including Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Autoimmune Encephalitis. Over-active immune cells and microglia driving chronic neuroinflammation results in release of cytokines with activation of leukocytes and is thought to contribute to neuronal injury, death, gliosis, and demyelination. The tyrosine kinase 2 ("TYK2") and janus jinase 1 ("JAK1") signal transduction pathways mediate highly complementary immune and inflammatory signaling events. Targeted, small-molecule therapies that inhibit TYK2 or JAK kinases have separately demonstrated robust efficacy in autoimmune, dermatologic and gastrointestinal disorders. TYK2 is a validated immune target as evidenced by a recent peripheral program that gained FDA approval, and there are multiple additional peripheral non-CNS programs in clinical development. Brain penetrant inhibitors of TYK2/JAK1 have the potential to bring this validated immune target to brain disorders.
There are currently no brain penetrant, selective, dual TYK2/JAK1 inhibitors approved for brain disorders. We expect to advance BHV-8000 (previously TLL-041) into a Phase 1 study in 2023. The Company is evaluating and has not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including trial size, and primary and secondary endpoints.
Glutamate
The most advanced product candidate from our glutamate receptor antagonist platform is troriluzole (previously referred to as trigriluzole and BHV-4157), which is in two Phase 3 trials in OCD. Other product candidates include BHV-5500, which is an antagonist of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (“NMDA”) receptor.
Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter present in over 90% of all brain synapses. Glutamate plays an essential role in normal brain functioning and its levels must be tightly regulated. Abnormalities in glutamate levels can disrupt nerve health and communication, and in extreme cases may lead to nerve cell death. Nerve cell dysfunction and death leads to devastating diseases, including ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Glutamate clearance is necessary for proper synaptic activation and to prevent neuronal damage from excessive activation of glutamate receptors. Excitatory amino-acid transporters (“EAATs”) help regulate glutamate clearance, and are responsible for most of the glutamate uptake within the brain.
The mechanism of action of our glutamate platform is depicted below. Glutamate must be tightly regulated once released from a pre-synaptic neuron. It acts as a signaling neurotransmitter to stimulate the post-synaptic neuron via glutamate receptors (e.g., NMDA, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (“AMPA”) or Kainate receptors). Glial cells surrounding the synaptic junction are predominantly responsible for clearing glutamate through transporters, specifically the EAATs. There are five distinct types of glutamate transporters. The figure below depicts the areas of modulation that are affected by our product candidates. (1) As depicted in the glial cell to the right in the figure below, troriluzole increases the activity and expression of the EAATs to increase the clearance of glutamate released from the pre-synaptic neuron. Troriluzole also inhibits presynaptic ion channels that may inhibit the release of glutamate from presynaptic neurons. (2) As depicted in the postsynaptic neuron to the bottom of the figure below, BHV-5500 blocks glutamate signaling that is mediated by post-synaptic NMDA receptors. Modulating glutamate also has the potential to be neuroprotective and increase the release of neurotrophic factors, including brain derived neurotrophic factor (“BDNF”) which are endogenous molecules that help to support the survival of existing neurons, and encourage the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses.

Glutamate Transporter Modulation
Abnormal glutamate release or dysfunction of glutamate clearance can cause overstimulation of glutamate receptors which can lead to a dangerous neural injury called excitotoxicity, which has been associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. The FDA has approved anti-excitotoxicity drugs that act on the glutamatergic system by blocking NMDA receptors, such as memantine (“Namenda”) for Alzheimer’s disease, lamotrigine (“Lamictal”) for epilepsy and bipolar disorder and riluzole (“Rilutek”) for ALS. Although these drugs show the therapeutic potential of glutamate receptor antagonists and other glutamate modulators in the treatment of a range of neurological diseases, these approved drugs have serious side effects and other drawbacks that we have attempted to solve with our development of troriluzole.
Troriluzole
Troriluzole is a new chemical entity (“NCE”) and tripeptide prodrug of the active metabolite, riluzole. Based on its mechanism of action, preclinical data and clinical studies, troriluzole has potential for therapeutic benefit in a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Initial development has focused on its use in treating SCA, an orphan neurological indication that currently has no approved drug therapies and for which the active metabolite, riluzole, has demonstrated preliminary efficacy in two prior randomized controlled trials conducted by third parties. 
Ristori et al. reported a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 40 patients presenting with cerebellar ataxias of diverse etiologies, including SCA. Subjects were randomized to receive 8 weeks treatment with either placebo or riluzole (50 mg Riluzole tablets, twice daily). Statistically significant improvement in the riluzole treated group was demonstrated on the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (“ICARS”). The number of patients with a 5-point ICARS drop was higher in the riluzole group than in the placebo group after 4 weeks (9/19 vs 1/19; odds ratio [“OR”] =16.2; 95% confidence interval [“CI”] 1.8–147.1) and 8 weeks (13/19 vs 1/19; OR = 39.0; 95% CI 4.2– 364.2). The mean change in the riluzole group ICARS after treatment revealed a decrease (p < 0.001) in the total score (-7.05 [4.96] vs 0.16 [2.65]).
Romano et al. described results of a second randomized, placebo-controlled trial subjects diagnosed with a hereditary ataxia (including SCAs) randomized to receive 12 months of treatment with either placebo or riluzole (50 mg, twice daily). 60 patients were randomized. Statistically significant improvement in the riluzole treated group was demonstrated on the Scale for the Assessment of Ataxia (“SARA”). The proportion with decreased SARA score was 14 (50%) of 28 patients in the riluzole group versus three (11%) of 27 in the placebo group (OR 8.00, 95% CI 1.95– 32.83; p=0.002).
We acquired troriluzole from ALS Biopharma, LLC (“ALS Biopharma”) and Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center, Inc. (“FCCDC”), along with an estate of over 300 prodrugs. A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized in the body into an active drug. Troriluzole is actively transported by virtue of recognition of its tripeptide moiety by the PepT1 transporter in the gut and is responsible for the increased bioavailability of the drug. Once inside the body, the prodrug, troriluzole is cleaved by enzymes in the blood to the parent, riluzole. To mitigate the limitations of riluzole, 
several classes of prodrugs were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in multiple in vitro stability assays that predict in vivo drug levels. Troriluzole is a third generation of prodrug development and the product of six years of intensive chemistry efforts.
Riluzole is currently only indicated for ALS and has a number of non-desirable attributes that have limited its clinical use. Key limitations of riluzole include poor oral bioavailability, difficulty swallowing due to tablet formulation, food reducing efficacy, liver toxicity, pharmacokinetic variability, and oral numbness.
The prodrug design and selected administration pathway that was pursued with troriluzole is intended to address all of these limitations of riluzole. In addition, a prodrug can be engineered to enhance absorption and protect from diminished absorption when taken with meals. The troriluzole preclinical development strategy was based on optimizing in vivo and in vitro features, such as stability in gastrointestinal and stomach fluids; stability in liver microsomes; limiting off-target effects (particularly liver effects); metabolic cleavage in the plasma to release the active moiety; and enhanced gastrointestinal absorption properties. In in vivo studies in rodents, the intended benefits of this optimization program were observed, including delayed peak concentrations and greater exposure.
After six years of chemistry development and preclinical testing, the resulting lead prodrug from the chemistry program was troriluzole. Troriluzole is chemically comprised of riluzole linked via an amide bond to a tripeptide that is a substrate for PepT1 and which contributes to its improved bioavailability. The tripeptide moiety is cleaved by plasma aminopeptidases, releasing riluzole and naturally occurring amino acids, which we believe are readily managed by endogenous metabolic routes. We believe that the estate of compounds we acquired, combined with our internally developed intellectual property, will provide a significant protection for our innovations. Troriluzole is stable in fluids from the gastrointestinal tract and expected to have a differentiated profile with regard to any liability for hepatic effects.
Our Clinical Program for Troriluzole 
Phase 1 Studies with Troriluzole
In July 2016, we began a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (“PK”) of single and multiple ascending doses of troriluzole in normal healthy volunteers. 58 healthy volunteers were dosed with troriluzole and 20 were dosed with placebo. Both single and multiple doses up to 200 mg were well tolerated without evidence of novel, clinically significant safety signals or lab abnormalities. There was no apparent dose response regarding the frequency or severity of adverse events (“AEs”). In the blinded group, including subjects treated with both placebo and troriluzole, the most common AEs were headache (five subjects, two with moderate severity and three with mild severity) and constipation (two subjects). No pattern of AEs or lab abnormalities were apparent to provide specific cautions or to suggest cautions beyond what is appropriate for the active metabolite, riluzole. Commencing in December 2017, an additional single and multiple dose study was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability and PK of a 280 mg dose in 10 healthy young and elderly volunteers (eight active; two placebo). The results supported adequate safety and tolerability and yielded mean exposures comparable to what would be expected from a 200 mg dose, a dose that has been safely used in clinic populations and associated with efficacy in a range of disorders in randomized controlled trials (Huntington Study Group Neurology 2003; Lacomblez Neurology 1996). In addition, a bioequivalence study was conducted to bridge a commercial formulation with a Phase 2/3 formulation in 32 healthy volunteers. The commercial formulation was well-tolerated and provided bioequivalent exposure with the Phase 2/3 formulation.
Troriluzole for OCD
OCD is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by symptoms of obsessions (intrusive thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that can interfere with patients’ functional abilities. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the 12-month prevalence of OCD is 1% of the U.S. adult population, and approximately half of these cases are characterized as severe. First-line treatment for OCD includes cognitive behavioral therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (“SSRIs”) and adjunctive use of atypical antipsychotics. Nonetheless, up to 60% of patients have an inadequate response to conventional intervention strategies and some seek invasive neurosurgical procedures to ameliorate symptoms. 
We are currently developing troriluzole as a potential treatment option for patients suffering from OCD. Despite the significant public health burden, no novel mechanisms of action have been approved by the FDA for OCD in over two decades. The rationale for use of troriluzole in OCD is supported by clinical data with its active metabolite, riluzole, in populations with OCD in open-label and placebo-controlled clinical trials as well as in preclinical, genetic and neuroimaging studies implicating the glutamatergic hyperactivity in the pathogenesis of OCD.
In multiple case studies, the use of riluzole in patients with refractory OCD has commonly been associated with meaningful improvement of symptoms. A small-scale randomized controlled trial in adults with OCD conducted by a third party showed favorable trends for the use of riluzole in an outpatient setting. Another randomized controlled third-party study demonstrated statistically significant therapeutic effects with the adjunctive use of riluzole as compared to 
adjunctive placebo in 50 adults with refractory OCD. These clinical effects are consistent with findings such as genetic associations of glutamate transporter genes with OCD and increased glutamate concentrations in brain and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with OCD. Taken together, we believed there was a clear rationale for advancement of troriluzole, a prodrug of riluzole, into a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in OCD.
We commenced a Phase 2/3 double-blind, randomized controlled trial on the use of troriluzole in adults with OCD in late 2017. Results from the Phase 2/3 trial were announced in June 2020. Troriluzole 200 mg administered once daily as adjunctive therapy in OCD patients with inadequate response to standard of care treatment showed consistent numerical improvement over placebo on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (“Y-BOCS”) at all study timepoints (weeks 4 to 12) but did not meet the primary endpoint at week 12. Troriluzole treated subjects (n = 111) had a mean Y-BOCS improvement of -3.4 points from baseline versus -2.9 for placebo-treated (n = 115) subjects [difference -0.5 and p-value = 0.451] at week 4, -5.1 points (n = 96) versus -3.6 for placebo-treated (n = 108) subjects [difference -1.5 and p-value = 0.041] at week 8, and -5.9 points (n = 99) versus -4.9 for placebo-treated (n = 102) subjects [difference -1.0 and p-value = 0.220] at week 12. Troriluzole’s safety profile was generally consistent with past clinical trial experience with its active metabolite, riluzole. Treatment emergent adverse events (“TEAE”s) were mostly reported to be mild in intensity. TEAEs that occurred in at least 5% of patients in the troriluzole group, and more frequently in the troriluzole group than in the placebo group, were headache, dizziness, fatigue, somnolence, nausea and nasopharyngitis.
Given the strong signal in the Phase 2/3 proof of concept study and after receiving feedback from the FDA in an End of Phase 2 meeting, in December 2020 we initiated enrollment in a Phase 3 program. The Phase 3 program will have an estimated total enrollment of 1,300 participants with a primary endpoint of change from baseline on the Y-BOCS total score at week 4, 8 and 10. The two Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that make-up our Phase 3 program for OCD are currently ongoing with enrollment expected to be completed in the second half of 2023.
Troriluzole for Glioblastoma
Preclinical and small-scale pilot studies are underway to explore troriluzole’s use in the treatment of a pipeline of other indications such as some cancers whose spread is thought mediated by glutamate transmission, such as melanoma and glioblastoma ("GBM").
In collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, we explored the potential applicability of troriluzole for GBM. The oncology collaboration Johns Hopkins was based upon the mechanistic rationale that some tumors over express glutamate receptors, the central role that glutamate may have in cancer metabolism and the effect of glutamate on the tumor microenvironment.
In December 2021, the Global Coalition for Adaptive Research ("GCAR") selected troriluzole for evaluation in Glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning Environment - NCT03970447 ("GBM AGILE"). GBM AGILE is a revolutionary patient-centered, adaptive platform trial for registration that tests multiple therapies for patients with newly-diagnosed and recurrent GBM, the most fatal form of brain cancer. Troriluzole will be evaluated in all patient subgroups of the trial which include newly-diagnosed methylated O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (“MGMT”), newly-diagnosed unmethylated MGMT, and recurrent GBM. Troriluzole was selected for inclusion in GBM AGILE based on compelling evidence showing deregulation of glutamate in GBM. The therapeutic potential of troriluzole in GBM and other oncology indications is supported by several recent clinical and translational research studies conducted with troriluzole and its active moiety. For example, Medikonda et al. showed a survival benefit with troriluzole, alone and in combination with anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (“PD-1”) immunotherapy, utilizing a frequently used murine brain tumor model. C57BL/6J mice were intracranially implanted with luciferase-tagged GL261 glioma cells. Mice were randomly assigned to the control, anti-PD-1, troriluzole or combination anti-PD-1 plus troriluzole treatment arms, and median overall survival was assessed. The troriluzole treatment arm demonstrated improved survival compared with the control arm (median survival of 36% vs. 0%; p < 0.0001), as did the combination anti-PD-1 plus troriluzole treatment arm (overall survival of 80% vs. 0; p = 0.0007).
In July 2022, the Company and GCAR announced that enrollment has commenced in GBM AGILE for the evaluation of troriluzole. GBM AGILE is a multi-arm, platform trial. The evaluation of each therapy in GBM AGILE proceeds in 2 possible stages. A therapy's Stage 1 is an adaptively randomized screening stage for evaluating the therapy within patient signatures compared against a common control. A therapy in Stage 1 will stop accruing patients if it reaches its maximal sample size, drops for futility, or evinces inadequate safety. If a therapy reaches an efficacy threshold for graduation from Stage 1, it will move into Stage 2 within one of the prospectively defined signatures. The maximum sample size in Stage 1 is 150 patients. For a therapy graduating to Stage 2 there is a fixed randomization, expansion cohort. The maximum sample size in Stage 2 is 50 experimental patients in the graduating signature. The primary analysis of a regimen's effect on overall survival (“OS”) uses all patients in both its stages and all control patients in the trial in the graduating signature, suitably adjusted for any possible time trends.
Troriluzole for SCA
 Based on the results of our Phase 1 trial with troriluzole and two third-party academic trials that have shown preliminary efficacy of riluzole in cerebellar ataxias, we advanced troriluzole into a Phase 2/3 clinical trial for SCA. Initially, we had conducted a Phase 2b/3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess the safety and efficacy of troriluzole over 8 weeks in subjects with SCA. In October 2017, we announced that troriluzole at a dose of 140 mg once daily (“QD”) did not differentiate from placebo on the primary endpoint of the mean change from baseline on the SARA total score after 8 weeks of treatment. After eight weeks of treatment, troriluzole treated subjects (n = 63) demonstrated an improvement of –0.81 points [95% CI: –1.4 to –0.2] on the SARA versus –1.05 points [95% CI: –1.6 to –0.4] improvement in placebo-treated (n = 68), p-value = 0.52. In this trial, we observed a favorable safety and tolerability profile of troriluzole, with no drug-related serious adverse events (“SAEs”) and low discontinuation rates due to AEs. During open-label treatment over the 48-week extension phase, however, troriluzole did show slowing of disease progression in troriluzole-treated subjects in contrast to the measurable decline expected for a cohort of untreated subjects based on the natural history of the disease. Based on our learnings from the Phase 2b/3 study, including analyses from the open-label extension phase, we advanced troriluzole into a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to assess the safety and efficacy of troriluzole over 48 weeks in subjects with SCA. We enriched this trial with specific SCA genotypes, extended the treatment period of this trial to 48 weeks, implemented the use of a modified SARA scale (“f-SARA”), and increased the dose of troriluzole to 200 mg QD. Notably, the f-SARA is a novel, 16-point scale developed in collaboration with FDA as the primary outcome measure for this trial; the scale was designed to limit subjectivity of the scale and focus on functional aspects of the disease so that significant changes would be considered clinically meaningful.
In May 2022, the Company announced top-line results from the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of its investigational therapy, troriluzole, in adult patients with SCA. The primary endpoint, change from baseline to week 48 on the f-SARA, did not reach statistical significance in the overall SCA population as there was less than expected disease progression over the course of the study. In the overall study population (n = 213), the troriluzole and placebo groups each had mean baseline scores of 4.9 on the f-SARA and the two groups showed minimal change at the 48-week endpoint with f-SARA scores of 5.1 and 5.2, respectively (p=0.76). Troriluzole was well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. The frequency of subjects with any TEAE was 80.6% for troriluzole vs. 84.4% for placebo and the frequency of subjects with serious TEAEs was 5.6% for troriluzole vs. 7.3% for placebo.
Post-hoc analysis of efficacy measures by genotype suggests a treatment effect in patients with the SCA Type 3 (“SCA3”) genotype, which represents the most common form of SCA and accounted for 41% of the study population. In the SCA3 subgroup, troriluzole showed a numerical treatment benefit on the change in f-SARA score from baseline to week 48 compared to placebo (least squares (“LS”) mean change difference -0.55, nominal p-value = 0.053, 95% CI: -1.12, 0.01). SCA patients treated with troriluzole showed minimal disease progression over the study period. Further, in patients in the SCA3 subgroup who were able to walk without assistance at baseline (i.e., f-SARA Gait Item score = 1), troriluzole demonstrated a greater numerical treatment benefit on the change in f-SARA score from baseline to week 48 compared to placebo (LS mean change difference -0.71, nominal p-value = 0.031, 95% CI: -1.36, -0.07). 
Across all genotypes, patients who were able to ambulate at baseline (i.e., f-SARA Gait Item score = 1) showed a reduction in the relative risk of falls in troriluzole-treated patients versus placebo. Patient reported falls, as measured by adverse events reveal an approximately 58% reduction of fall risk in the troriluzole group (10% versus 23% AE incidence of falls in the troriluzole and placebo groups, respectively; nominal p=0.043).
The risk reduction of falls in the troriluzole group combined with the progression of f-SARA scores in the untreated SCA3 group compared to SCA3 patients on troriluzole demonstrates that SCA3 patients experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in ataxia symptoms on troriluzole treatment. Given these findings and the debilitating nature of SCA, we intend to interact with the FDA and or European Medicines Agency ("EMA") in the first half of 2023. We have not yet decided on the format of such a regulatory interaction but we could seek advice through various formal or informal interactions with regulatory agencies or we could choose to submit an NDA if we believe that is warranted from the results of our ongoing post-hoc analyses. There are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of SCA or any other cerebellar ataxia, and treatment is supportive. In general, multidisciplinary care provides supportive measures and the goal of this treatment is to improve quality of life and survival.
Glutamate NMDA Receptor Antagonism and BHV-5500 for Neuropathic Pain
An NMDA receptor antagonist is a type of glutamate antagonist that works to inhibit the action of NMDA receptors which may play a role in various diseases that affect the brain. BHV-5500 (lanicemine) was in-licensed from AstraZeneca and is a low-trapping, NMDA receptor antagonist with differentiating pharmacologic properties from other agents in development targeting this receptor. The unique property of low-trapping antagonists is their ability to uncouple from the NMDA receptor more freely than other agents, a property that is thought to contribute to their mitigated risk of dissociative effects as has been observed in the clinic. Lanicemine, binds within the NMDA channel pore and functionally blocks the flow of charged ions through the NMDA receptor complex.
Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition caused by dysfunctional or damaged nerves. Neuropathic pain can be a debilitating and common problem affecting approximately 10% of adults in the United States. Despite the availability of multiple approved drugs, including Lyrica, and guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain, treatment of this condition remains a major therapeutic challenge. Existing analgesics are often ineffective, can cause serious side effects and have abuse potential that limits widespread use. Increased NMDA receptor activity is known to contribute to central sensitization in neuropathic pain. NMDA receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce hyperalgesia and pain in animal models of neuropathic pain induced by nerve injury and diabetic neuropathy. Clinically used NMDA receptor antagonists, including ketamine and dextromethorphan, can be effective in patients suffering from neuropathic pain syndromes. The clinical use of robust NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, is limited due to dissociative, psychotomimetic and abuse potential properties. Novel NMDA receptor antagonists, such as BHV-5500, that are not associated with the psychotomimetic effects and abuse potential could lead to better management of neuropathic pain without causing serious side effects.
MPO
Verdiperstat
Verdiperstat is a selective, brain-permeable, irreversible myeloperoxidase (“MPO”) enzyme inhibitor that may have potential for the treatment of neurological diseases. MPO generates an array of cytotoxic oxidants and is a key driver of oxidative and inflammatory processes that underlie a broad range of disorders. MPO plays a key role in neurodegenerative, inflammatory, and immune-mediated diseases, including multiple system atrophy (“MSA”), Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, ischemic and hemorrhagic forms of stroke, epilepsy, depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical and experimental studies have revealed the detrimental role of MPO. Hence, suppressing MPO may be a novel treatment approach for these disorders.
Verdiperstat (formerly named AZD3241) was in-licensed from AstraZeneca in September 2018.
Our Clinical Program for Verdiperstat for ALS
ALS is a progressive, life-threatening, and rare neuromuscular disease that affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States. The median age of onset is 55 years and average survival is 3-5 years after onset of first symptoms. ALS is characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord that leads to progressive muscle weakness and difficulties in speaking, swallowing, and breathing. There are currently limited treatment options and no cure for ALS. 
MPO may play a role in increasingly recognized ALS disease mechanisms mediated by peripheral myeloid cells, including those that migrate into the brain as well as those that remain in the periphery, suggesting relevance of MPO as a therapeutic target. In September 2019, we announced that verdiperstat was selected to be studied in the pivotal HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, which is being conducted by the Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS at MGH (“Healey Center”) in collaboration with the Northeast ALS Consortium (“NEALS”) clinical trial network. Promising investigational drugs were chosen for the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial through a competitive process, with the Healey Center providing partial financial support to successful applicants. The HEALEY ALS Platform Trial is a Phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of investigational products for the treatment of ALS. HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Regimen B is evaluating the safety and efficacy of verdiperstat in approximately 167 adults with ALS. Participants were randomized in a 3-to-1 ratio treated with verdiperstat 600 mg BID or placebo for 24 weeks. The study's primary efficacy endpoint measures the change in disease severity from baseline to week 24 on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised in patients receiving treatment versus placebo. Secondary endpoints include change in respiratory function, muscle strength, and survival. In August 2020, we announced that the first patients were enrolled in the pivotal HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Regimen B. Enrollment in the trial was completed in November 2021. 
In September 2022, the Company announced that verdiperstat did not statistically differentiate from placebo on the prespecified primary efficacy outcome, disease progression measured by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised and survival, nor the key secondary efficacy measures during the 24-week study period. Analysis of safety data was consistent with the overall profile of verdiperstat from prior clinical trial experience. The study results have been presented at scientific meetings in 2022, including the NEALS Consortium meeting and the International Symposium on ALS/MND. Publication of these study results in an academic medical journal is pending. At this time, we do not have plans to pursue any additional clinical trials evaluating verdiperstat in ALS, and we may evaluate its potential in other disease indications.
Myostatin
Taldefgrobep Alfa (BHV-2000)
In February 2022, we announced a worldwide license agreement with BMS for the development and commercialization rights to taldefgrobep alfa (also known as BMS-986089), a novel Phase 3 asset. Myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle growth, is a key member of the Transforming Growth Factor ("TGF") (symbol Beta) family. 
Taldefgrobep novelty in a field of myostatin inhibitors is based on the mechanism where it binds to myostatin to both lower overall myostatin levels, but also to function as a receptor antagonist to block myostatin signaling in skeletal muscles. Blocking myostatin activity and signaling has shown to improve muscle function and strength in a number of disease models for neuromuscular wasting. Clinical studies have confirmed that taldefgrobep improved lean body mass directly through increase in contractile muscle and loss of adipose tissue as demonstrated in both normal healthy volunteers and in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”). The mechanism of improving overall muscle size and function opens the opportunity for taldefgrobep as a monotherapy or combination therapy in a number of muscle-targeted neuromuscular diseases. 
The addition of taldefgrobep alfa expanded our Neuroinnovation pipeline. The advanced taldefgrobep alfa anti-myostatin development program offers extensive human safety data, especially in the pediatric population. 
About Spinal Muscular Atrophy
SMA is a rare genetic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons, atrophy of the voluntary muscles of the limbs and trunk and progressive muscle weakness that is often fatal and typically diagnosed in young children. The underlying pathology of SMA is caused by insufficient production of the survival of motor neuron (“SMN”) protein, essential for the survival of motor neurons, and is encoded by two genes, SMN1 and SMN2. In the U.S., SMA affects approximately 1 in 11,000 births, and about 1 in every 50 Americans is a genetic carrier. Newborn screening is now available in 48 U.S. states and covers over 94% of all births. 
Our Clinical Trial for Taldefgrobep Alfa in SMA 
In July 2022, we commenced enrollment in a Phase 3 clinical trial assessing the efficacy and safety of taldefgrobep alfa in SMA. The Phase 3 placebo-controlled, double-blind trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of taldefgrobep as an adjunctive therapy for participants who are already taking a stable dose of nusinersen or risdiplam or have a history of treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi, compared to placebo. The primary outcome measures of the study will be efficacy of taldefgrobep alfa compared to placebo in the change in the 32 item Motor Function Measure (“MFM-32”) total score from baseline to Week 48. Scores range from 0-3 on each item, with higher scores indicating higher functioning. The study is neither restricted nor limited to patients based on ambulatory status or classification of SMA. We expect to randomize approximately 180 patients in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled global trial.
In February 2023, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA for taldefgrobep alfa for the treatment of SMA. Fast Track designation enables important new drugs to reach patients earlier by facilitating more frequent communications with the FDA and expeditious review of a drug which treats a serious condition and fills an unmet 
medical need. In December 2022, we received orphan drug designation from the FDA for taldefgrobep in the treatment of SMA.
Taldefgrobep Alfa’s Role in Spinal Muscular Atrophy
 In the past three years, significant advancements were made to address the underlying cause of disease in SMA with the up-regulation of SMN1 and SMN2 expression which positions taldefgrobep as a potential combination therapy to enhance muscle performance. Data from both an SMA animal model study that shows advantages of combination SMN therapy with taldefgrobep and the extensive clinical data in DMD support the advancement of taldefgrobep into a SMA Phase 3 study. Other indications in muscle wasting diseases will be a fast follow-on for taldefgrobep along with other life-cycle opportunities. 
Discovery Research
The Company has laboratory facilities located in Science Park in New Haven, Connecticut, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and in Cambridge, Massachusetts supporting our integrated chemistry and discovery research operations. We will continue to augment our discovery efforts through research partnerships, including research agreements such as with KU Leuven and the Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center Inc..
TRPM3 Antagonists
KU Leuven Agreement 
In January 2022, we entered into the KU Leuven Agreement to develop and commercialize TRPM3 antagonists to address the growing proportion of people worldwide living with chronic pain disorders (the "KU Leuven Agreement"). The TRPM3 antagonist platform was discovered at the Centre for Drug Design and Discovery and the Laboratory of Ion Channel Research at KU Leuven. Under the KU Leuven Agreement, we receive exclusive global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize KU Leuven's portfolio of small-molecule TRPM3 antagonists. The portfolio includes the lead candidate, BHV-2100, which we are evaluating in several preclinical pain models and advancing towards the clinic in 2023. We are continuing to support further basic and translational research on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders through our collaboration with Professors Joris Vriens and Thomas Voets, world leaders in TRP biology at KU Leuven.
Efforts to target TRP Channels for pain
Since the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the capsaicin receptor TRPV1 in 1997, members of the Transient Receptor Potential (“TRP”) cation channel family have been elusive drug targets for the treatment of pain. Initially, there was much excitement and investment in TRPV1 antagonists due to promising preclinical efficacy and some evidence of clinical pain reduction. However, trials of most TRPV1 antagonists were terminated after the class consistently caused clinically-significant hyperthermia in study participants. Several companies then made efforts to progress antagonists of TRPA1, the receptor for mustard oil. Though Glenmark’s GRC 17536 showed encouraging results in a subset of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain subjects in a Phase 2a study, it suffers from poor physiochemical properties and pharmacokinetics like many other TRPA1 antagonists. Due to the challenges with drugging TRPA1, only Eli Lilly’s LY3526318 remains in active clinical development. 
TRPM3 is a novel target in the TRP family. Like TRPV1 and TRPA1, preclinical data and human genetic validation support TRPM3’s role in neuropathic pain. Unlike TRPV1 antagonists, TRPM3 antagonists are unlikely to possess significant thermal liabilities, and unlike TRPA1 antagonists, Biohaven’s TRPM3 antagonists have desirable 
physiochemical properties and good pharmacokinetic profiles. The figure below illustrates TRPM3 as a differentiated target for the treatment of pain in the TRP family.

Adapted from Efforts to target TRP channels for pain, Kovivisto et al. 2022

About TRPM3
Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 3 (“TRPM3”) is a novel druggable target in the TRP cation channel family. TRPM3 is functionally expressed in the human dorsal root ganglion, and several SNPs in TRPM3 are associated with altered pain sensation in response to UVB (see figure below). Additionally, people with TRPM3 gain-of-function mutations experience altered pain sensation (de Sainte Agathe 2020, Dyment 2019, Van Hoeymissen 2020). Knocking out or antagonizing TRPM3 in animal models attenuates the development of various pain states, including those associated with nerve injury, chemotherapy, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, further indicating that TRPM3 is a promising target for neuropathic pain. Lastly, preclinical evidence suggests that antagonizing TRPM3 may avoid the on-target body temperature effects and TRPV1 antagonist-induced malignant hyperthermia.

Our Development of BHV-2100 for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain
BHV-2100 is an orally-bioavailable small molecule antagonist of TRPM3. TRPM3 is expressed in the relevant human tissue types for neuropathic pain, and both preclinical models and human genetics implicate TRPM3 in pain signaling. BHV-2100 is our lead orally-bioavailable small molecule TRPM3 antagonist which we are developing as a potential non-opioid treatment for neuropathic pain. We are evaluating the ability of BHV-2100 to reduce pain behaviors across several 
preclinical models of neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy induced neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and nerve injury. We expect to submit an IND application for BHV-2100 with the FDA in the second half of 2023, complementing our efforts with our Kv7 platform. The Company is evaluating and has not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including trial size, and primary and secondary endpoints. 
Additional research on TRPM3-mediated disorders
Under the KU Leuven agreement, Biohaven is supporting further basic and translational research at KU Leuven on the role of TRPM3 in pain and other disorders. In addition to BHV-2100, we are optimizing other lead compounds for TRPM3-mediated disorders of the peripheral and central nervous systems.
Bispecific Molecular Degraders of Extracellular Proteins
Molecular Degraders of Extracellular Proteins (“MoDEs”) are bispecific molecules that target pathologic circulating proteins and direct them to the liver (or other organ systems) for degradation by the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. Our MoDE platform is being explored for use in a wide range of therapeutic areas, including indications in autoimmune diseases, cancer and infectious disease. We are generally planning for MoDEs to be administered as intravenous or subcutaneous formulations. The Company is evaluating and has not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including trial size, and primary and secondary endpoints.
Antibody-based Galactose-deficient IgA (“Gd-IgA”) MoDEs
IgA nephropathy (“IgAN”) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis that can progress to renal failure and is characterized by immunoglobulin deposits in the renal mesangium comprised exclusively of the IgA1 subclass. Patients with IgAN have increased serum levels of IgA1 with a hinge region containing truncated galactose-deficient O-linked saccharides (“Gd-IgA”) and can present with a range of symptoms, from hematuria or proteinuria to severe hypertension owing to renal damage. The clinical progression varies, with 30–40% of patients reaching end-stage renal disease 20–30 
years after the first clinical presentation. Currently, no IgAN-specific therapies are available. Patients are managed with the aim of controlling blood pressure and maintaining renal function.

Lai, Nat Rev Dis Primers (2016)

We are leveraging our MoDE platform to develop novel bispecific molecules for the treatment of IgA nephropathy (“IgAN”) that remove potentially disease-causing Gd-IgA or total IgA in patients and prevent harmful kidney deposits. We have taken a published rodent format IgG antibody that recognizes Gd-IgA and converted it into a partially-humanized, liver-targeted degrader MoDE using Multimodal Antibody Therapy Enhancer ("MATE") conjugation that potently binds Gd-IgA and causes its endocytosis in human liver cells. Further work is ongoing to progress this as a potential IgAN treatment. 
Therapeutic pan-IgG depletion
Analogous to the depletion of pan-IgA or dg-IgA with molecular degraders, hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor ("ASGPR") ligand degraders able to recognize all potentially pathogenic isoforms of IgG represent a novel, competitive platform with differentiated profile relative to FcRN inhibitors. FcRN inhibitors such as efgartigimod (Vyvgart) and nipocalimab also deplete IgG. Specifically, high circulating levels of antibodies (monoclonal or polyclonal gammopathy) drive conditions such as myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, pemphigus vulgaris and many other diseases. It is hypothesized that rapid and sustained lowering of pathogenic antibody titers in blood will significantly reduce disease symptoms. As this has been shown with FcRN inhibitors for myasthenia gravis (Vyvgard), therapeutic pan-IgG depletion using Biohaven’s proprietary MoDE platform technology is expected to have significant potential benefit for multiple diseases including but not limited to the conditions outlined above. Drug candidates utilizing this technology are in nonclinical development, approaching IND. 
The following graphic shows preclinical data validating this approach. The effect of a single dose of our IgG degrader MoDE, BHV-1300, was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. BHV-1300 demonstrated robust reduction of IgG levels, with 75% depletion from baseline. This effect was rapid, occurring by 3 days. For comparison, published data with the standard 
of care, efgartigimod, are included below, noting that reduction of IgG levels with efgartigimod is 50% and takes 5-7 days to achieve. The Company expects to submit an IND application for BHV-1300 with the FDA in the second half of 2023. 
MATE Conjugation Technology
Antibody Drug Conjugates
We are using the MATE conjugation technology to generate site-specific antibody drug conjugates (“ADC”s) from native IgG1 proteins that we believe will show superior stability in comparison with those using current industry-standard cysteine maleimide conjugation. Our expectation is that the enhanced in vivo stability and expected superior physicochemical properties of these ADCs will lead to increased therapeutic indices (more cytotoxic payload reaching cancer cells and less reaching normal tissues). Over 15 site-specific ADCs using the well validated valine-citrulline monomethyl auristatin E ("vcMMAE") payload linker system have been prepared and are undergoing biological testing in comparison with industry standard maleimide conjugated ADCs.
MATE Molecule
BHV-1100
Antibody Recruiting Molecules
Antibody Recruiting Molecules (“ARMs”) are bispecific molecules that recruit endogenous antibodies to target cancer, virally infected cells, and disease-causing microorganisms for immune-mediated clearance. These molecules are engineered as modular components that are readily interchangeable, giving the platform tremendous flexibility for a variety of indications and therapy areas.
By recruiting antibodies to coat the disease cell target, ARMs mark it for removal by the body’s innate antibody-mediated immune mechanisms (antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis).
Platform advantages
Similar to biologics, ARMs directly engage patients’ immune system to destroy disease cells by connecting target disease cells with components of the immune system. However, unlike biologics, ARMs are smaller in size than an antibody potentially allowing for enhanced tumor penetration and biodistribution, and may offer manufacturing advantages including enhanced shelf stability. 
ARM™ NK Combination Therapy
ARMs provide target specificity to Natural Killer (“NK”) cell therapies without needing to design chimeric antigen receptors (“CARs”) or other methods of genetic manipulation. NK cells are a type of immune effector cell that can recognize and destroy non-self targets and certain diseased cells. NK cells do not target specific protein epitopes like T cells of the adaptive immune system. Our ARMs are being used to provide antigen target specificity to NK cell therapies (both allogeneic and autologous) with the goal of enhancing efficacy and safety. ARM NK combination therapy directs NK cells to a disease target of interest.
Our Clinical Trial for BHV-1100 in Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients
We have initiated dosing in a Phase 1a/1b trial in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients. Our ARM, BHV-1100, in combination with autologous cytokine induced memory-like (“CIML”) NK cells and immune globulin (“Ig”), is expected to target and kill multiple myeloma cells expressing the cell surface protein CD38. The trial is supported by compelling preclinical data showing that BHV-1100 enhanced recruitment of autologous CIML NK cells increases killing of multiple myeloma cells.
This open-label single center Phase 1a/1b study assesses the safety and tolerability as well as exploratory efficacy endpoints in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who have tested positive for minimal residual disease (“MRD+”) in first remission prior to autologous stem cell transplant (“ASCT”). We expect to enroll 30 newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma patients. The primary outcome measures are dose limiting toxicities following combination product administration (time frame: 100 days post-combination product administration) and incidence and severity of side effects related to the combination product (time frame: 90 to 100 days post-combination product administration).

University of Connecticut License Option
In October 2018, we signed an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement with the University of Connecticut for the development and commercialization rights to UC1MT, a therapeutic antibody targeting extracellular metallothionein ("MT"). Under this agreement, we had the option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license to UC1MT and its underlying patents to develop and commercialize throughout the world in all human indications, which we exercised in September 2022. 
Extracellular MT has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. MTs are a family of low molecular weight, cysteine-rich, metal-binding proteins that have a wide range of functions in cellular homeostasis and immunity. MT has traditionally been considered to be an intracellular protein that can be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus; however, MT also can be found in extracellular spaces, particularly in disease states involving chronic cellular stress where intracellular MT production is upregulated by inflammatory cytokines, and extracellular MT acts as a danger signal, attracting leukocytes and modulating the immune response. In preclinical studies, UC1MT has been observed to block this extracellular pool of MT and the resulting MT-mediated inflammation and immunomodulation. The Company is evaluating and has not yet finalized potential clinical trial designs, including trial size, and primary and secondary endpoints. 
Artizan Biosciences Inc License Option
In December 2020, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Artizan Biosciences Inc ("Artizan"), a biotechnology company focused on creating new classes of precision therapies targeting chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation by leveraging the human gut as a drug discovery tool. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired an option to obtain a royalty-based license from Artizan to manufacture, use and commercialize certain products. Artizan will use the proceeds to continue advancing the preclinical research and development of its lead program for inflammatory bowel disease as well as to explore additional disease targets. In November 2021, we announced a collaborative therapeutic discovery and development program in Parkinson’s disease (“PD”), to exploit recent scientific advances in the understanding of pathogenic roles played by the gut microbiome in PD. In June 2022, we and Artizan executed a non-binding indication of interest (“Artizan Side Letter”) which describes terms under which we and Artizan would amend the 2020 Artizan Agreement to eliminate certain milestone payments required by us in exchange for limiting our option to the selection of the first (ARZC-001) licensed product. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Artizan was unable to secure additional financing to support it's ongoing operations, and, as a result, began reviewing strategic options for the sale of its assets, and secured a small bridge financing to fund operations during the strategic review. In January, Artizan severed substantially all of its employees and halted the PD program. Although Artizan anticipates bringing the inflammatory bowel disease program to the clinic in 2023, its ability to do so will be dependent on its access to adequate funding. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their safety, efficacy, convenience, price, the level of 

generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management 


personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Manufacturing
We have an experienced chemistry and manufacturing leadership team that manages our relationships with third party manufacturers. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the development and manufacturing of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing of our products if our product candidates receive marketing approval.
We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Commercialization 
We intend to develop and, if approved by the FDA, commercialize our product candidates in the United States, and we may enter into distribution or licensing arrangements for commercialization rights for other regions. With respect to our product candidates, we currently intend to build a neurological specialty sales force to manage commercialization for these product candidates, potentially in combination with a larger pharmaceutical partner, to maximize patient coverage in the United States and to support global expansion.
Members of our management team and board of directors have deep experience leading neuroscience research and have been involved in the development and commercialization of drugs such as Abilify, Opdivo and, most recently, Nurtec ODT.
Our Chief Executive Officer, Vlad Coric, M.D. was the Chief Executive Officer of the Former Parent from 2015 through the Separation, leading the Former Parent’s development and successful commercial launch of Nurtec ODT (rimegepant) in the U.S., which received FDA approval for the acute and preventative treatment of migraine in February 2020 and May 2021, respectively. Under Dr. Coric’s leadership, the Former Parent entered into several strategic arrangements, including its Collaboration and License agreement with Pfizer, Inc. for the development of rimegepant and zavegepant outside of the United States.
Intellectual Property
We own or license patents in the U.S. and foreign countries that protect our products, their methods of use and manufacture, as well as other innovations relating to the advancement of our science to help bring new therapies to patients. We also develop brand names and trademarks for our products to differentiate them in the marketplace. We consider the overall protection of our patents, trademarks, licenses and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and act to protect these rights from infringement. We also rely on trade 

secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of our products and development programs.
In the biopharmaceutical industry, a substantial portion of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. A product’s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property: patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled.
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most pharmaceuticals. Patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine. Patents may cover, among other things, the active ingredient(s), various uses of a drug product, discovery tools, pharmaceutical formulations, drug delivery mechanisms and processes for (or intermediates useful in) the manufacture of products. Protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
Market exclusivity can also be influenced by regulatory data protection ("RDP"). Many developed countries provide certain non-patent incentives for the development of medicines. For example, in the U.S., the EU, United Kingdom, Japan, and certain other countries, RDP intellectual property rights are offered to: (i) provide a time period of data protection during which a generic company is not allowed to rely on the innovator’s data in seeking approval; (ii) restore patent term lost during drug development and approval; and (iii) provide incentives for research on medicines for rare diseases, or orphan drugs, and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients. These incentives can extend the market exclusivity period on a product beyond the patent term.

See Note 11, "Licensing and Other Agreements," to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information regarding our licenses and other agreements.
Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including imposition of a clinical hold, refusal by the FDA to approve applications, withdrawal of an approval, import/export delays, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial 

suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. Key steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include:
•preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP");
•the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug ("IND") application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
•approval by an independent institutional review board ("IRB"), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each indication and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices ("GCP");
•the preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application ("NDA");
•FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA, which might include an Advisory Committee review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMPs").
The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and the receipt and timing of any approval is uncertain. The FDA may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Preclinical and Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of the product candidate, as well as in vitro and animal studies to gather information on the safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of preclinical trials is subject to federal regulations and requirements including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective 


before clinical trials may be commenced. The IND will become effective automatically 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. The FDA may nevertheless initiate a clinical hold after the 30 days if, for example, a deficiency is found in the IND application.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board ("IRB") at each of the sites at which the trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution.
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases prior to approval, but the phases may overlap or be combined. These phases generally include the following:
Phase 1.    Phase 1 clinical trials represent the initial introduction of a product candidate into human subjects, frequently healthy volunteers. In Phase 1, the product candidate is usually tested for safety, including adverse effects, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacodynamics.
Phase 2.    Phase 2 clinical trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population with a specific disease or condition to (1) evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific indications, (2) determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
Phase 3.    If a product candidate is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 clinical trials, the clinical trial program will be expanded to Phase 3 clinical trials to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling.
Phase 4.    Clinical trials may be conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under accelerated approval regulations, or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of post-market requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in enforcement action or withdrawal of approval.
A Phase 2/3 trial design, which we have used in our troriluzole development program, is often used in the 

development of pharmaceutical and biological products. The trial includes Phase 2 elements, such as an early interim analysis of safety or activity, and Phase 3 elements, such as larger patient populations with less restrictive enrollment criteria. The early interim analysis of clinical or physiologic activity and/or safety allows the study to be stopped, changed or continued before a large number of patients have been enrolled, while still allowing all data from enrolled patients to count in the analysis used to support approval.
Submission and Review of an NDA
The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the product's manufacture, composition, quality, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, requesting approval to market the product. The application must be accompanied by a significant user fee payment, which typically increases annually, although waivers may be granted in limited cases. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept an application if they determine that the data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies.
Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. A standard review is 10 months from the date the application is accepted for filing and a priority review is 6 months from the date the application is accepted for filing. The review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews NDAs to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities comply with cGMPs. Additionally, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites, as well as the Sponsor of the NDA, for compliance with GCP and integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy.
During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy ("REMS") is necessary to assure the safe use of the product post approval. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the application must submit a proposed REMS, and the FDA will not approve the application without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. The FDA could also require a special warning, known as a boxed warning, to be included in the product label in order to highlight a particular safety risk. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee of external experts to provide input on certain review 


issues relating to risk, benefit and interpretation of clinical trial data. The FDA may delay approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and/or the FDA requires additional testing or information. The FDA may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
On the basis of the FDA's evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA will issue either an approval of the NDA or a Complete Response Letter ("CRL"), detailing the deficiencies in the submission and the additional testing or information required for reconsideration of the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request a hearing. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the United States pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims and some manufacturing and supplier changes are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also require a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among other things, medication guides, special trainings for prescribers and dispensers, patient registries, and elements to assure safe use.
In addition, entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. The FDA has promulgated specific requirements for drug cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP 

requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may issue enforcement letters or withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Corrective action could delay product distribution and require significant time and financial expenditures. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities.
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
As an alternative path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of drugs previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies 


not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the company by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product. As such, under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may rely, for approval of an NDA, on data not developed by the applicant. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements, including clinical trials, to support the change from the approved branded reference drug. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for the new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
Our clinical program for troriluzole for the treatment of SCA and the treatment of OCD is based on a regulatory pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that allows reference to data on riluzole for the purpose of safety assessments.
Product Exclusivity - United States
In the United States, biopharmaceutical products are protected by patents with varying terms depending on the type of patent and the filing date. A significant portion of a product’s patent life, however, is lost during the time it takes an innovative company to develop and obtain regulatory approval of a new drug. As compensation at least in part for the lost patent term due to regulatory review periods, the innovator may, depending on a number of factors, apply to the government to restore lost patent term by extending the expiration date of one patent up to a maximum term of five years, provided that the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than 14 years from the date of drug approval. A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the U.S. must submit a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the FDA. If the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical product, the company files an NDA. If the medicine is a biological product, a Biologic License Application ("BLA") is filed. The type of application filed affects regulatory data protection (“RDP”) exclusivity rights.
Small Molecule Products
A competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of small molecule drug in the U.S. must file an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA") with the FDA. In the ANDA, the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic substitute and the approved NDA drug. The ANDA relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its NDA. An innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the FDA in what is commonly known as the FDA’s Orange Book. The FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after the innovator’s listed patents expire unless there is a successful patent challenge. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the Orange Book 

under an innovator’s NDA is either invalid or not infringed (a Paragraph IV certification). The innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer. From time to time, ANDAs, including Paragraph IV certifications, could be filed with respect to certain of our products. 
In addition to patent protection, certain innovative pharmaceutical products can receive periods of regulatory exclusivity. An NDA that is designated as an orphan drug can receive seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication. During this time period, neither NDAs nor ANDAs for the same drug product can be approved for the same orphan use. A company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical studies are conducted at the written request of the FDA to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients, and submission to the FDA is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity. Medicines approved under an NDA can also receive several types of RDP. An innovative chemical pharmaceutical product is entitled to five years of RDP in the U.S., during which the FDA cannot approve generic substitutes. If an innovator’s patent is challenged, as described above, a generic manufacturer may file its ANDA after the fourth year of the five-year RDP period. A pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in an NDA, but is approved in a new formulation, but not for the drug itself, or for a new indication on the basis of new clinical studies, may receive three years of RDP for that formulation or indication.
Biologic products
The ACA, which includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, created an approval pathway for biosimilar versions of innovative biological products that did not previously exist. Prior to that time, innovative biologics had essentially unlimited regulatory exclusivity. Under the new regulatory mechanism, the FDA can approve products that are similar to (but not generic copies of) innovative biologics on the basis of less extensive data than is required by a full BLA. After an innovator has marketed its product for four years, any manufacturer may file an application for approval of a “biosimilar” version of the innovator product. However, although an application for approval of a biosimilar version may be filed four years after approval of the innovator product, qualified innovative biological products will receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity, meaning that the FDA may not approve a biosimilar version until 12 years after the innovative biological product was first approved by the FDA. The law also provides a mechanism for innovators to enforce the patents that protect innovative biological products and for biosimilar applicants to challenge the patents. Such patent litigation may begin as early as four years after the innovative biological product is first approved by the FDA.


In the U.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators’ intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators’ market exclusivity. First, generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators’ basic patents covering major pharmaceutical products. Second, statutory and regulatory provisions in the U.S. limit the ability of an innovator company to prevent generic and biosimilar drugs from being approved and launched while patent litigation is ongoing. As a result of all of these developments, it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for a particular product with certainty based solely on the expiration of the relevant patent(s) or the current forms of regulatory exclusivity.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
European Union
A typical route used by innovator companies to obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in the EU is through the “centralized procedure.” A company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical product through the centralized procedure must file a complete set of safety data and efficacy data as part of a Marketing Authorization Application ("MAA") with the EMA. After the EMA evaluates the MAA, it provides a recommendation to the European Commission ("EC") and the EC then approves or denies the MAA. Regulatory approval via the centralized procedure results in a marketing authorization for the innovative pharmaceutical product in each EU member state. It is also possible for new chemical products to obtain marketing authorization in the EU through a “mutual recognition procedure,” in which an application is made to a single member state, and if the member state approves the pharmaceutical product under a national procedure, then the applicant may submit that approval to the mutual recognition procedure of some or all other member states. After obtaining marketing authorization approval, a company must obtain pricing and reimbursement for the pharmaceutical product, which is typically subject to 

member state law. In certain EU countries, this process can take place simultaneously while the product is marketed but in other EU countries, this process must be completed before the company can market the new product. The pricing and reimbursement procedure can take months and sometimes years to complete. Throughout the EU, all products for which marketing authorizations have been filed after October/November 2005 are subject to an “8+2+1” regime. Eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product, a generic company may file a MAA for that product with the health authorities. If the MAA is approved, the generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 or 11 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization granted to the innovator. The possible extension to 11 years is available if the innovator, during the first eight years of the marketing authorization, obtains an additional indication that is of significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing treatments. For products that were filed prior to October/November 2005, there is a 10-year period of data protection under the centralized procedures and a period of either six or 10 years under the mutual recognition procedure (depending on the member state). In contrast to the U.S., patents in the EU are not listed with regulatory authorities. Generic versions of pharmaceutical products can be approved after data protection expires, regardless of whether the innovator holds patents covering its drug. Thus, it is possible that an innovator may be seeking to enforce its patents against a generic competitor that is already marketing its product. Also, the European patent system has an opposition procedure in which generic manufacturers may challenge the validity of patents covering innovator products within nine months of grant. In general, EU law treats chemically-synthesized drugs and biologically-derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and data protection. In addition to the relevant legislation and annexes related to biologic medicinal products, the EMA has issued guidelines that outline the additional information to be provided for biosimilar products, also known as generic biologics, in order to review an application for marketing approval.
Japan
In Japan, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded eight years of data exclusivity for approved indications and dosage. Patents on pharmaceutical products are enforceable. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations. As in the U.S., patents in Japan may be extended to compensate for the patent term lost during the regulatory review process. In general, Japanese law treats chemically-synthesized and biologically-derived drugs the same with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity. 
China
To obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in China, an NDA must be submitted to the National Medical Products Administration ("NMPA") once safety and efficacy has been established in Chinese patients. For imported 


drugs, this means issuance of an import license. The applicant must submit evidence of foreign approval (certificate of pharmaceutical product), unless it is an innovative drug that has never been approved anywhere in the world.
In China, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded 6 years of data exclusivity for approved indications and dosage. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations. 
South Korea
To obtain marketing authorization of pharmaceutical products in South Korea, a marketing application must be submitted to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety ("MFDS"). The application must contain data in South Korean patients, information regarding safety and efficacy, quality, a good manufacturing practice certificate, and a certificate of pharmaceutical product in an approved country to show that the drug being imported is being sold in the approved country in accordance with the with the relevant rules and regulations in that country. 
In South Korea, medicines of new chemical entities are generally afforded 6 years of data exclusivity for first approved indications and dosage. Generic copies can receive regulatory approval after data exclusivity and patent expirations.
Rest of the World
In countries outside of the U.S., the EU, Japan, China and South Korea, there is a wide variety of legal systems with respect to intellectual property and market exclusivity of pharmaceuticals. Most other developed countries utilize systems similar to either the U.S. or the EU. Among developing countries, some have adopted patent laws and/or regulatory exclusivity laws, while others have not. Some developing countries have formally adopted laws in order to comply with World Trade Organization ("WTO") commitments, but have not taken steps to implement these laws in a meaningful way. Enforcement of WTO actions is a long process between governments, and there is no assurance of the outcome. 
Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing
Challenges exist that pertain to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which regulatory approval is sought. In the United States and foreign markets, sales of any products that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and the adequacy of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private entities, such as managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting 

the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. The latter is often informed by entities such as the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review ("ICER") which provides a reimbursement rate based on a multifactorial value assessment. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Typically patients must "step through," or fail less expensive therapies such as generics in order to be prescribed a branded therapy. Moreover, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. For example, the payor's reimbursement payment rate may not be adequate or may require patient co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from one payor system to the next. Private payor systems set reimbursement policy in accordance with their particular model. For example, some payor systems mandate value based pricing wherein a particular price point is premised upon achieving a particular goal. These can include an improvement in patients’clinical course (therapeutic effectiveness), or reductions in drug and health care utilization and cost. Thus a third-party payor's decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide the same level of coverage for the product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
Third-party payors payors require evidence of value that are supplemental to the regulatory mandates of safety and efficacy in order to support a particular price. To obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, there is often a need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity (based on evidence of disease burden and unmet need) and cost-effectiveness of the therapy. As mentioned, the ICER evidence review mandates such information.These studies will be in addition to the studies required to obtain regulatory approvals. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, they may deem a subpopulation of eligible patients based on greater unmet need as eligible for reimbursement. Thus, obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status can be time-consuming and costly.But drug developers accept these requirements as a condition of reimbursement, analogous to their acceptance of the level of evidence needed to obtain regulatory approval.
The U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. For example, the U.S. and particularly state legislatures have implemented cost 


containment programs that include price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and "first use" of generic products prior to access to branded prescriptions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act ("collectively, the ACA") contains provisions such as increased rebates for products sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies' share of sales to federal health care programs. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") moved 41% of Medicare fee-for-service payments to alternative payment models ("APMs") tied to the quality or value of services by the end of 2018. HHS had set a goal of moving 50% of such Medicare payments into these alternative payment models by the end of 2018, but in 2019, this performance goal was discontinued and replaced it with a new developmental goal to increase the percentage of Medicare health care dollars tied to APMs incorporating downside risk, with a target of 40% for fiscal year 2021. These constitute significant challenges,which are analogous to the regulatory hurdles in many aspects and drug developers acknowledge these challenges as the path to providing safe and effective therapies to the patients that require them. 
European Union Coverage Reimbursement and Pricing
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement requirements can vary widely from country to country. Some countries link market authorization to reimbursement decisions. Others may require the completion of additional studies that assess the cost-effectiveness or comparative effectiveness of novel approved drugs relative to standard of care. These are compiled as health technology assessments ("HTAs"), that constitute a requisite for reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of access restrictions that typically target sub populations with high unmet need.
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
Physicians, other healthcare providers, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors are and will be subject to various federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and 

other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may impact, among other things, healthcare professionals who participate in our clinical research programs, and our proposed sales, marketing, distribution, and education programs. The U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, without limitation, the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federally funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value;
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal civil monetary penalties law and the civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced by private citizens through qui tam actions), prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") which imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH") enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on entities subject to the law, such as healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates to safeguard the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information from any unauthorized use or disclosures;
•The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs such as CHIP to report to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and 


teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests; and
•Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that impose similar restrictions and may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs, comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or to track and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration provided to physicians and other health care providers; and state health information privacy and data breach notification laws, which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and some of which are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We will be required to spend substantial time and money to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these federal and state healthcare laws. For example, the ACA amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that liability under these statutes does not require a person or entity to have actual knowledge of the statutes or a specific intent to violate them. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Violations of these laws can subject us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions including monetary penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and reputational harm, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Moreover, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our future operations and business.
Healthcare Reform
The legislative landscape in the United States continues to evolve. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. 

In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which includes measures that have significantly changed health care financing by both governmental and private insurers. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states, without specifically ruling on the ACA’s constitutionality.
The provisions of the ACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are, among others, the following:
•an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, which is apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
•new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and certain others, including reporting “transfers of value” made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers and reporting investment interests;
•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
•a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
•extension of a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;
•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct 


comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
•establishment of the Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. In January of 2021, an Executive Order entitled “Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act” repealed two previous Executive Orders delaying the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that amend all or part of the ACA.
In addition, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 (known as Medicare sequestration) and subsequent extensions, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, with a subsequent one quarter phase-in of 1%) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Further, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments from providers from three to five years. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 also introduced a quality payment program under which certain individual Medicare providers will be subject to certain incentives or penalties based on new program quality standards. Payment adjustments for the Medicare quality payment program were scheduled to begin in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement under the Medicare program.
Further, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion. The previous administration released a "Blueprint" to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs of drugs. HHS solicited feedback on some of these measures and, concurrently, implemented others under its existing authority. President Biden continues to push for reforms that would address the high cost of drugs. In response to an Executive Order from President Biden, the Secretary of HHS recently 

issued a comprehensive plan for addressing high drug prices that describes a number of legislative approaches and identifies administrative tools to address the high cost of drugs. And Democrats recently included drug pricing reform provisions reflecting elements of the plan in a broader spending package in late 2021—such as capping Medicare Part D patients’ out-of-pocket costs, establishing penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation in Medicare, and authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices on certain select, high-cost drugs under Medicare Parts B and D. While a number of these and other proposed measures would require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which included, among other things, a provision allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
 At the state level, legislatures are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.


Environmental, Social, Governance, and Human Capital
Governance and Leadership
Our commitment to integrating sustainability across our organization begins with our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board has oversight of strategy and risk management related to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”). Applying NYSE’s listing standards for independence, six of our eight directors are independent.
At the management level, we have implemented a cross-functional Sustainability Working Group, which is set to meet on a regular basis and report to the Board of Directors periodically. We also maintain a Chief Talent & Sustainability Officer position to work closely with the working group and coordinate efforts related to the advancement of ESG capabilities across the organization.
Business Ethics
We are committed to creating an environment where we are able to excel in our business while maintaining the highest standards of conduct and ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”) will reflect the business practices and principles of behavior that support this commitment, including our policies on bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest and our whistleblower program. We expect every director, officer, and employee to read, understand, and comply with the Code of Conduct and its application to the performance of his or her business responsibilities.
We encourage employees to come to us with observations and complaints, ensuring we understand the severity and frequency of an event in order to escalate and assess accordingly. Our Chief Compliance Officer strives to ensure accountability, objectivity, and compliance with our Code of Conduct. If a complaint is financial in nature, the Audit Committee Chair is notified concurrently, which triggers an investigation, action, and report. All incidents are reported up to the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis.
Environmental Commitment
We are committed to protecting the environment and attempt to mitigate any negative impact of our operations. We monitor resource use, improve efficiency, and at the same time reduce our emissions and waste.
In order to reduce the overall impact of our product on the environment, we have taken steps to enhance the sustainability of our manufacturing processes for our drug substances.
In collaboration with our contract research organization partners, we apply various green chemistry methodologies to our commercial and development 

pipeline. We have especially focused on using biocatalysis, a technology that makes use of enzymes instead of chemicals to accomplish specific chemical reactions used to construct organic small molecules such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients. 
We have also initiated work in removing hazardous organic solvents from certain reactions and replacing them with water. This green technology relies on the use of micelles to enable such reactions to occur in water where they would normally not occur due in part to the very poor solubility of most organic compounds in water. These greener processes not only create less waste, but the waste that is produced is much less hazardous, therefore reducing the environmental impact of the manufacturing process.
Social Responsibility
For third-party vendor selection and oversight, we have adopted standard operating procedures that apply to employees and subcontractors who on our behalf, oversee and conduct research regulated by the FDA. We retain ultimate authority and responsibility for the conduct of regulated research, manufacturing, and testing and we must ensure that contracted services are conducted in accordance with Good Practice Guidelines and all applicable regulations.
Human Capital Management
We foster and encourage a workplace environment that holds possibilities for everyone, with a commitment to respect and acceptance without biases. 
Development and continuous feedback are priorities for our organization, which was comprised of 202 employees as of January 1, 2023. We believe each person is critical to our success and we invest in our people by supporting continuous training programs and courses. We encourage each employee to engage with their manager in developmental discussions designed to focus on feedback rather than a rating.
An important part of our talent recruitment is our robust paid internship program for high school, college and graduate-level students. This program offers opportunities to students in the community and develops a roadmap for ‘entry-level’ candidates. We evaluate the success of our recruitment program through metrics such as time to hire, offer acceptance rate, turnover rate and business results. 
We strive to provide an inclusive workplace to foster growth and innovation. Biohaven is committed to gender diversity in the workforce, as evidenced by a workforce that is approximately 60% female and includes a robust group of female leaders in the scientific and associated fields.
Biohaven engages in forward-thinking people policies to allow for our employees to thrive in our workforce. Regular attendance at an office is only required of our lab professionals, allowing over 50% of 


our workforce to work remotely full-time. Our vacation policy is unlimited, and is aimed at giving employees the ability to achieve work/life balance in a way that is bespoke to their circumstances.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020, we quickly established both an office-based and field-based response to protect our employees. We first and foremost encouraged all office-based employees to work from home and provided support for fully remote work. In our offices, we follow health and safety protocols by providing mandatory masks for anyone entering the building, foot-dispensing hand sanitizer stations, and disinfecting wipes at each workstation. We purchased high efficiency air filters to ensure air is not recirculated in the facilities. We offer antibody testing and encourage employees to be tested for COVID-19 frequently.
