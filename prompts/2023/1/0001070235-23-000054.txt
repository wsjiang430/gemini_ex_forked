Security Software Industry
As the digital transformation of enterprises continues to advance, workforces are becoming more decentralized, mobile and remote, and data and applications are increasingly migrating to the cloud. As part of this trend, the number of connected endpoints is growing rapidly, as is their complexity and the volume of sensitive data that they process and store. These endpoints, which include smartphones, laptops, desktops, servers, vehicles, industrial equipment and other connected devices in the Internet of Things (“IoT”), increasingly operate beyond the traditional network security perimeter and present an expanding attack surface to cyber adversaries.
At the same time, the threat environment for enterprises and manufacturers has become increasingly hostile as the number of adversaries grows and the scale and sophistication of their attacks, increasingly focused on the endpoint, continue to develop. Today’s malicious actors are often well-trained and well-funded criminal organizations, state-sponsored agents and international hacking collectives with the capability of employing advanced techniques to penetrate endpoints and encrypt, destroy or exfiltrate data. These groups have been responsible for highly publicized breaches that have exposed personal information and intellectual property, disrupted operations and infrastructure, extracted ransoms and caused significant reputational damage to organizations across a broad range of industries.
Against this backdrop, regulators are enacting new measures to ensure that enterprises are held accountable for their management of cybersecurity risk. In particular, changes to data privacy laws in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions are compounding the challenges faced by organizations by increasing their responsibilities for securing their data as well as that of their customers.
This landscape of growing vulnerability and accountability has created opportunities for secure communications platforms, endpoint cybersecurity and management solutions, embedded systems, enterprise applications, analytic tools and related services that help enterprises to secure their connected endpoints, enhance functional safety, maintain data privacy and demonstrate compliance with applicable regulations.

Competitive Strengths
Key competitive factors important to the Company across its businesses include product features (including security features), relative price and performance, product quality and reliability, compatibility across ecosystems, service and support, and corporate reputation. The Company believes that it delivers the broadest set of security capabilities and visibility in the market, covering users, devices, networks, apps and data.
Cybersecurity
The BlackBerry Spark platform establishes comprehensive security controls in any connected IoT environment and meets a growing market demand for a solution that integrates unified endpoint security and endpoint management capabilities in a single console with visibility across all endpoints. The platform is differentiated through its use of a zero-trust architecture that uniquely combines intelligent security with a user experience that requires little to no support from end users or IT administrators, simplifying management and reducing costs. 
The BlackBerry Cyber Suite leverages Cylance AI, machine learning and automation to provide improved cyber threat prevention and remediation, and can help users to understand risks, make contextual decisions and dynamically apply policy controls with no user interruption, mitigating risks before they materialize. The Company trains its AI model against data lakes containing billions of files so that it learns to autonomously convict, or not convict, files prior to their execution. Unlike traditional signature-based cybersecurity technology, this prevention-oriented approach is able to protect enterprises from malicious zero-day payloads before they are deployed, and even when protected endpoints are offline. Additionally, detection and response decisions are pushed down to the endpoint, minimizing response latency so that a minor security event can be addressed before it becomes a widespread incident. BlackBerry Protect has earned Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”) authorization.
The BlackBerry Spark UEM Suite includes leading unified endpoint management, secure business productivity, application containerization, secure collaboration and digital rights management capabilities. BlackBerry UEM has earned National Information Assurance Partnership (“NIAP”) certification and is an approved mobile device management solution on the U.S. Department of Defense Information Network’s Approved Product List.
The Spark platform is also differentiated by the inclusion of a sophisticated network operations center in the BlackBerry infrastructure. The Company pioneered the use of this architecture to route messages reliably and efficiently to and from mobile devices, and over time has expanded capabilities to enable end-to-end secure communications between endpoints and applications and enterprise networks.
BlackBerry SecuSUITE technology has been certified to be compliant with the Common Criteria protection profile for VoIP applications and SIP servers. It has also earned NIAP certification and NATO Communications and Information Agency security accreditation, and has been placed on the National Security Agency’s Commercial Solutions for Classified Program component list of products certified for use on classified systems.
The BlackBerry AtHoc and BlackBerry Alert platforms are mobile and scalable, integrate with legacy systems and support on-premise and cloud-based deployments. With available incident management and encrypted end-to-end instant messaging capabilities, the platforms offer a suite of secure crisis communication services to meet the growing number of use cases for emergency or mass notifications. BlackBerry AtHoc has received FedRAMP certification and is the leading provider of network-centric, interactive crisis communication to the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, among other governmental bodies. BlackBerry AtHoc helps to protect more than 75% of U.S. government personnel. 
IoT
In the embedded software industry, systems are becoming increasingly connected and complex, with software being used for functions that were previously performed by hardware, driving new functional safety considerations. BlackBerry QNX is recognized for attaining the highest levels of security certifications and approvals for many of its embedded products and is the leader in safety-certified, secure and reliable software for the automotive industry. BlackBerry QNX is a trusted supplier of operating systems, hypervisors, development tools and support to automotive OEMs and Tier 1 vendors and to the general embedded market. BlackBerry QNX technology is embedded in over 215 million vehicles.
Competition
The Company is engaged in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly evolving. Frequent new product introductions and changes to endpoints, operating systems, applications, security threats, industry standards and the overall technology landscape result in continuously evolving customer requirements for mobile solutions. The Company competes with a broad range of vendors in each of its businesses. See “Competitive Strengths” above for a discussion of how the Company believes it differentiates itself from competitors in its various businesses.
With the BlackBerry UEM Suite, the Company competes primarily with providers of enterprise software solutions. BlackBerry’s UES Technology, including the BlackBerry Cyber Suite, competes with various types of providers, including: traditional signature-based antivirus vendors and identity management; vendors whose business focuses almost solely on EPP; EDR vendors, which primarily focus on continuous monitoring and human response to advanced security threats; companies that provide endpoint systems management; and large network security providers, which have entered the market primarily through acquisition. The BlackBerry QNX automotive business competes principally with providers of embedded software that employ customized Linux open-source operating systems for the transportation and logistics industry, and with Google’s Android Automotive OS. See Part 1, Item 1A “Risk Factors - The Company faces intense competition”.
Product Design, Engineering and Research and Development 
The Company’s research and development (“R&D”) strategy seeks to drive innovation to continuously enhance the Company’s product portfolio and introduce exciting solutions to the market.
The Company dedicates a major portion of its R&D investments to the development of software products and services for its Cybersecurity and IoT solutions. Solutions include leading security capabilities at each level of the platform in order to address 
the needs of enterprise IT departments and end users for securing devices, applications, content and work data at rest and in transit.

Intellectual Property
The protection of intellectual property is an important part of the Company’s operations. The policy of the Company is to apply for patents and to acquire or seek other appropriate proprietary or statutory protection when it develops valuable new or improved technology. The Company believes that the rapid pace of technological change in the industries in which the Company operates makes patent and trade secret protection important, and that this protection must be supported by other means including the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, new product introductions and frequent product enhancements.
The Company believes that its patent portfolio continues to provide a competitive advantage in its core product areas as well as provide leverage in the development of future technologies. The Company does not believe that it is dependent upon a single patent or even a few patents and instead primarily depends upon its extensive know-how, innovative culture, and technical leadership. 
The Company protects its technology through a combination of patents, designs, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual arrangements. The Company seeks to patent key concepts, components, protocols, processes and other inventions that it considers to have commercial value or that will likely give the Company a technological advantage. Although the Company applies for patent protection primarily in Canada, Europe and the United States, the Company has filed, and will continue to file, patent applications in other countries where there exists a strategic technological or business reason to do so. To broadly protect the Company’s inventions, the Company has a team of in-house patent attorneys and also consults with outside patent attorneys who interact with employees, review invention disclosures and prepare patent applications on a broad array of core technologies and competencies. As a result, the Company owns rights to an array of patented and patent pending technologies which include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity, cryptography, machine learning, artificial intelligence, operating systems, acoustics, messaging, enterprise software, automotive subsystems, networking infrastructure and wireless communications. As of February 28, 2023, the Company owned approximately 37,500 worldwide patents and applications. The Company does not expect that the sale of its portfolio of primarily legacy patents under the Malikie Transaction will negatively impact its strategy of protecting its new innovations through patent filings.
It is the Company’s general practice to enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with its employees, consultants, contract manufacturers, customers, potential customers and others to attempt to limit access to, and distribution of, its proprietary information. In addition, the Company generally enters into agreements with employees that include an assignment to the Company of all intellectual property developed in the course of employment.
The Company does not rely primarily on patents or other intellectual property rights to protect or establish its market position; however, it is prepared to enforce its intellectual property rights in certain technologies when attempts to negotiate mutually agreeable licenses are not successful. The Company also enters into inbound licensing agreements related to technology and intellectual property rights, including agreements to obtain rights that may be necessary to produce and sell products.
Environmental, Social and Governance
The Company observes the highest ethical standards in its operations and has adopted policies and practices that require the same of its business partners. The Company’s business is based on trust, and the Company maintains its position as a global leader in data security and privacy by developing new technologies, complying with established and evolving regulatory frameworks, acting with integrity and adhering to responsible business practices. See also “Ethical Business Conduct and Code of Business Standards and Principles” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company is committed to operating in a sustainable way that respects the environment, the Company’s employees and business partners, and the communities in which the Company operates around the world. To honor this commitment, the Company maintains a variety of programs to identify, execute and maintain sustainable initiatives and to reduce its direct and indirect environmental impact. In fiscal 2022, these programs enabled the Company to achieve carbon neutrality across its Scope 1, Scope 2 and material Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and the Company maintained its carbon neutral status as at the end of fiscal 2023.
In fiscal 2020, the Company joined the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC”) and committed to the ten principles of the UNGC and to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that are relevant to the Company’s business. In its procurement activities, the Company engages with its suppliers to conduct due diligence into the source of the so-called “conflict minerals” (which currently include the minerals from which gold, tantalum, tin, and tungsten are derived) that are necessary to the functionality or production of the Company’s hardware products, principally for the BlackBerry Radar business. The Company also seeks to make a positive impact in the communities in which it operates by investing in strategic charitable partnerships, supporting charitable endeavours by employees, and building community relationships through local offices.
The Company has formalized a number of policies to reflect its commitment to responsible business practices, including a Privacy Policy, Supplier Code of Conduct, Human Rights Policy, Equal Employment Policy and Supplier Diversity Policy, and periodically issues a corporate responsibility report. Through the report, the Company provides visibility on its environmental, social and governance initiatives such as mitigating its corporate carbon footprint and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving water sanitation and fostering diversity. These documents and policies relating to the Company’s corporate responsibility initiatives can be viewed on the Company’s website at https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/corporate-responsibility and are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Foreign and domestic laws and regulations apply to many aspects of the Company’s business. 
The Company collects and uses a wide variety of information for various purposes in its business, including to help ensure the integrity of its services and to provide features and functionality to customers. This aspect of the Company’s business is subject to a broad array of evolving privacy and data protection laws, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the proposed Canadian Consumer Privacy Protection Act, regional privacy frameworks such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Privacy Framework, and national and state laws within the United States, including the California Privacy Rights Act. These laws impose strict operational requirements and can provide for significant penalties for non-compliance. Elements of these evolving laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation and enforcement, remain unclear and the Company may be required to modify its practices to comply with them in the future.
The Company is also subject to numerous international trade laws and regulations, including, without limitation, tariffs, trade sanctions, export controls and technology transfer restrictions, as well as anti-corruption legislation such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.
Additionally, the Company is subject to domestic and international laws relating to environmental protection and the proliferation of hazardous substances. In parts of Europe, North America, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, the Company is obligated to comply with substance restrictions, packaging regulations, energy efficiency ratings and certain product take-back and recycling requirements, principally for the BlackBerry Radar business. The U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act also requires the Company to comply with certain due diligence and disclosure obligations with respect to the use of conflict minerals. Furthermore, the Company may be subject to a variety of local laws unknown to the Company in foreign jurisdictions where customers are located.
Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses or registrations, loss of approved status, private litigation, regulatory or governmental investigations, administrative enforcement actions, sanctions, civil and criminal liability, and constraints on the Company’s operations. It is also possible that current or future laws or regulations could be interpreted or applied in a manner that would prohibit, alter, or impair the Company’s existing or planned products and services, or that could require the Company to undertake costly, time-consuming or otherwise burdensome compliance measures.

As of March 1, 2020, the Company began reporting with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as a domestic issuer instead of a foreign private issuer. Prior to that date, the Company was a foreign private issuer and, in compliance with SEC regulations, furnished its interim financial statements on Form 6-K and filed its Annual Report on Form 40-F. The Company continues to be a reporting issuer subject to continuous disclosure obligations under applicable Canadian securities laws.
