ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
(a) Business Development
 
ConneXionONE Corp. (the “Company”) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 12, 1997, under Caspian Development Group, Inc. The Company changed its name to Zenith International, Inc. in 1999, then to Cresset Precious Metals Inc in 2001, and to its current name, Alternative Fuel Technologies, Inc. on October 2, 2007. In 2018, the Company changed its domicile to the State of North Carolina and on October 24, 2018 changed its current name to ConneXionONE Corp.
 
The Company was a development stage company in the business of fuel injection systems and DME fuel injection systems, for internal combustion engines. The Company filed Form 10-SB in 2002. The Company was severely delinquent in filing annual reports for the Company’s charter. In addition, the company was subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements including filing 10Q’s and 10Ks. The Company was out of compliance with Exchange Act reporting and filed a Form 15-12G to terminate their registration on September 7, 2007.
 
Business operations for Alternative Fuel Technologies, Inc. was abandoned by former management and a custodianship action, as described in the subsequent paragraph, was commenced in 2017.
 
On May 27, 2017, the Sixteenth District Court of Macomb County of Michigan granted the Application for Appointment of Receiver as a result of the absence of a functioning board of directors and the revocation of the Company’s charter. The order appointed Tara Harvey (“Ms. Harvey”, the “Receiver”) receiver with the right to appoint officers and directors, negotiate and compromise debt, execute contracts, issue stock, and authorize new classes of stock.
 
Upon appointment as the Receivership of AFTC and under its duties stipulated by the Michigan court, Ms. Harvey took initiative to organize the business of the issuer. As Receiver, the duties were to conduct daily business, hold shareholder meetings, appoint officers and directors, reinstate the company with the Nevada Secretary of State. Ms. Harvey also had authority to enter into contracts and find a suitable merger candidate. Ms. Harvey was compensated for her role as custodian in the amount of 750,000,000 shares of Restricted Common Stock. Ms. Harvey did not receive any additional compensation, in the form of cash or stock, for custodian services. The custodianship was discharged on November 18, 2017.
 
On March 13, 2018, Ms. Harvey entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Haining Zhang, whereby Haining Zhang purchased 750,000,000 shares of Restricted Common Stock. These shares represent the controlling block of stock. Ms. Harvey resigned her position of sole officer and director and appointed Mr. Zhang as CEO and Director of the Company.
 
On September 10, 2018, a change of control occurred and Changs International, LLC (controlled by Chris Chang) purchased the control block of stock. The Company also entered into a Share Exchange Agreement to acquire all of the shares of ConneXionONE Corp (“XONE Cayman”), a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The agreement called for the exchange of all of the shares of XONE Cayman for the equivalent of 95% of the shares of the Company. On October 24, 2018, the Company filed to amend its Articles of Incorporation and change its name to ConneXionONE Corp. Mr. Zhang resigned all of his positions as officer and director of the Company and Mr. Chris Chang was appointed sole Officer and Director.
 
The cancellation of the share exchange agreement was completed in 2021 and the Company moved forward with its current business plan. AFTC changed its name to ConneXionONE Corp in 2018 in the state of North Carolina. The Company did not have control or ownership of XONE Cayman and no shares of AFTC were exchanged. The North Carolina corporation has no affiliation with the Cayman Islands corporation. The cancellation of the share exchange agreement did not have an impact on the Company and its ownership and there is no impact to the Company's financial statements and footnotes.

(b) Business of Issuer
 
ConneXionONE Corp. formerly Alternative Fuel Technologies, Inc. is a development stage company. Our business plan includes acquisitions of operating companies. The focus of the Company’s future business involves developing and operating a decentralized social media platform. Our business plan incorporates decentralized concept of social media platforms which do not have a centralized governing body and may, at some point, provide viable alternatives to established platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.
 
Social media mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful and directed patterns from data in social media, resulting from social interactions. It is an interdisciplinary field encompassing techniques from computer science, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, statistics, optimization, and mathematics. Social media mining represents the virtual world of social media in a computable way, measures it, and designs models that can help us understand its interactions. In addition, social media mining provides necessary tools to mine this world for interesting patterns, analyze information diffusion, study influence and provide effective recommendations, and analyze social behavior in social media.
 
We feel that our business plan addresses the need for additional development in the decentralized social media industry.
 
Decentralized social media (“DCSM”) platform is a sharing/consortium platform that will benefit Users, Content Providers, Advertisers, and Communication service providers.
 
DCSM Platform comprises of 3 major components, Content Aggregator, Mobile Advertising Mediation, Communication Proxy:
 
Content Aggregator

Communication Proxy

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | allowing interconnected service providers to make on-net communications with DCSM app users 



The analysis will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into definitive agreements. In our continued efforts to analyze potential business plan, we intend to consider the following factors:
 
· | Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Competitive position as compared to other DCSM platforms of similar size and experience within the social media within the industry as a whole
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance, and other required items
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in the marketplace; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other relevant factors
--+-----------------------

 
In applying the foregoing criteria, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing our business plan.
 
We are unable to predict when we will, if ever, identify and implement our business plan. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate.
 
As of this filing, we have not raised any capital and our business is under development stage, and the Company is focused on raising capital for its business plans. We have not realized any revenues. However, We have engaged developers and started the development of our first mobile app for the decentralized social media platform of the Company.
