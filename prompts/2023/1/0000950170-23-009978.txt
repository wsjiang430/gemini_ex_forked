Item 1. Business
Overview
 Reneo is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies for patients with rare genetic mitochondrial diseases, which are often associated with the inability of mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Our lead product candidate, mavodelpar, is a potent and selective agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ). Mavodelpar has been shown to increase transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial function and increase fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and may increase production of new mitochondria.
 The PPAR family of nuclear hormone receptors, PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARδ, control the transcription of genes critical for regulating energy metabolism and homeostasis. PPARδ is highly expressed in muscle, kidney, brain, and liver tissue. Activation of PPARδ results in changes in the expression of genes involved with multiple aspects of energy metabolism including uptake of fatty acids, utilization of fatty acids as an energy source, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Increases in PPARδ activity also correlate with a shift in muscle tissue towards oxidative, fat-consuming type I fibers that are associated with endurance as opposed to glycolytic, type II fibers. In preclinical and clinical studies, increased PPARδ activity through transgenic overexpression or pharmacological activation increases muscular strength and endurance across a variety of functional measures.
Mavodelpar was studied in healthy male volunteers with one leg immobilized to produce muscle atrophy. Compared to placebo, administration of mavodelpar resulted in statistically significant increases in expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and statistically significant improvements in muscle strength. Mavodelpar was studied in an open-label trial in patients with primary mitochondrial myopathies (PMM). Patients with PMM in this trial exhibited improved function, reduced symptoms, and increased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function. Mavodelpar was also studied in an open-label trial in patients with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder (LC-FAOD). In this trial, patients with LC-FAOD due to certain gene defects exhibited improved function and reduced symptoms.
 As a PPARδ agonist, mavodelpar may benefit patients with genetic mitochondrial myopathies who experience weakness, fatigue, or deterioration in muscle due to impaired mitochondrial energy production. Patients with these diseases are unable to perform many everyday activities, can experience cardiomyopathy and other organ dysfunction, and typically have a reduced life expectancy. We are currently developing mavodelpar in rare genetic diseases that typically present with myopathy, including PMM and LC-FAOD.
 There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of PMM, representing a high unmet medical need.
 Our Product Pipeline
 The following table summarizes our mavodelpar development programs.
 

We are currently developing mavodelpar in the following rare genetic diseases that are associated with a deficit of energy production by the mitochondria and typically present with myopathy:
 •PMM: This rare genetic mitochondrial disease has an estimated prevalence in adults of 23:100,000, representing at least 66,000 patients in the United States and 82,000 in Europe. Patients with PMM are unable to move their muscles efficiently because their ability to generate energy through OxPhos is compromised. We are initially targeting adult patients with PMM due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) defects.
 •LC-FAOD: This rare genetic mitochondrial disease has an estimated prevalence of 1.5:100,000, representing at least 5,000 patients in the United States and 6,000 in Europe. The genetic alterations observed in these patients reduce their capacity to metabolize long-chain fatty acids as a source of energy for mitochondria. As patients with LC-FAOD grow older, they suffer from myopathy, lack of endurance, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. Muscle exertion in the absence of an adequate source of energy can result in the breakdown of muscle tissue that can subsequently cause kidney and cardiac damage. We are initially targeting adult patients with LC-FAOD with defects in long-chain 3-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2), and trifunctional protein (TFP).
Our Strategy
 Our mission is to bring to market therapies that address high unmet medical needs of patients with genetic mitochondrial diseases. We plan to achieve this goal by developing mavodelpar initially for adult patients with PMM and LC-FAOD and will continue to explore other patient populations where mavodelpar may provide benefit. We intend to establish mavodelpar as the standard of care for multiple rare genetic mitochondrial diseases. The components of our strategy are as follows:
 •Complete clinical development and seek regulatory approval of mavodelpar in PMM. Following our interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), and several other national regulatory agencies in Europe, we believe that positive results from our ongoing global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 2b trial of mavodelpar in adult patients with PMM due to mtDNA (STRIDE) along with the open-label, long-term safety trial outside of the United States in adult patients with PMM due to mtDNA (STRIDE AHEAD) could potentially support the registration of mavodelpar for adult patients with PMM due to mtDNA defects in the United States and Europe. We intend to submit the data from STRIDE, together with the long-term safety data from STRIDE AHEAD, to the FDA and the EMA in planned marketing applications in 2024. In addition, we are planning to study mavodelpar in patients with PMM due to nuclear DNA (nDNA) defects.
 •Commercialize mavodelpar in the United States and key European markets, and establish mavodelpar as the standard of care for rare genetic mitochondrial diseases around the world. We plan to build a fully integrated rare disease pharmaceutical company with a commercial infrastructure in the United States and key European markets. For regions outside of the United States and key European markets, we plan to explore strategic partnerships to bring mavodelpar to patients.
 •Maximize the commercial potential of mavodelpar in additional rare genetic mitochondrial disease indications. We have completed a Phase 1b study of mavodelpar in patients with LC-FAOD and are working with the FDA to map out the development pathway for our LC-FAOD program. Additionally, we aim to identify and pursue development of mavodelpar in other diseases that are defined by the inability of mitochondria to produce cellular energy.
 •Expand our rare disease pipeline through acquisitions and/or licensing of complementary programs. We plan to license and/or acquire additional programs targeting rare genetic diseases with high unmet medical need. We will leverage our experience in preclinical and clinical development, 

commercialization, and strong relationships with clinical investigators and patient advocacy organizations to bring therapeutic options to patients.
 Background
 How muscle cells generate energy and how that process is deficient in patients with genetic myopathies
 Cells generate energy in the form of ATP within intracellular structures called mitochondria. Mitochondria use proteins, carbohydrates, and fatty acids to make ATP, which is then used by the cell to support all cellular processes. Muscle tissue requires a high number of mitochondria to support energy needs.
 Muscle cells mainly rely on three sources to generate energy: phosphocreatine (P-Cr), carbohydrates, and fatty acids. Muscle cells initially use readily available P-Cr and glycogen to generate this energy. As these sources become depleted, muscle cells turn to fatty acids to generate cellular energy.
 Mitochondria are responsible for generating most of the energy for cells in the form of ATP. Cells have hundreds to thousands of mitochondria, with each mitochondrion containing proteins derived from both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Patients with PMM can have nuclear or mitochondrial gene defects that result in reduced energy production in the mitochondria. Patients with LC-FAOD have deficiencies in the enzymes that break down long-chain fatty acids, resulting in an energy deficit. Patients with both of these diseases suffer from lack of endurance, fatigue, muscle weakness and they are unable to move their muscles efficiently because their ability to generate energy through OxPhos is compromised. Therapies are very limited for patients with rare genetic mitochondrial diseases and consist mainly of dietary manipulations and nutritional supplements to provide alternate sources of energy, and a carefully controlled exercise regimen. Increasing the capacity of these patients to metabolize fatty acids could potentially reduce their energy deficit and improve their ability to function.
 Mitochondrial energy production involves a series of highly regulated metabolic processes that are sequenced based on the availability of nutrients and the length of time cells require energy. In the first minute of exertion, mitochondria utilize readily available P-Cr as a source of fuel to create ATP (Figure 1, step 1). When P-Cr is consumed, muscles turn to carbohydrate metabolism, as the next source of fuel to create ATP (Figure 1, step 2). Finally, after several minutes of exercise when P-Cr and carbohydrates are depleted, mitochondria turn to fatty acids as the source of fuel to create ATP (Figure 1, step 3). FAO becomes the primary pathway to generate energy for muscle and other cells during long periods of exercise.

Figure 1. The energy source used by muscles shifts from P-Cr and carbohydrates to fatty acids as supplies of P-Cr and carbohydrates are depleted
Oxidative phosphorylation
 

Figure 2. Nutrient utilization by mitochondria
 

Genetic mitochondrial myopathies are caused by deficiencies in specific steps of mitochondrial energy generation. Patients are unable to sustain normal muscle activity due to deficiencies in ATP production. We believe that enhancing FAO has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to patients with genetic myopathies.

PPARδ, a regulator of FAO
 PPARs are members of a family of nuclear receptors that, through their distinct functions and tissue distribution, regulate gene transcription involved in many biological processes, including metabolism and energy production.
 There are three PPAR isotypes: alpha (α), gamma (γ) and delta (δ). PPAR α and γ agonists drugs have been approved in cardiovascular and endocrine disorders, respectively.
 PPARδ is highly expressed in muscle cells and activation of PPARδ either through genetic manipulation or through small molecule agonists has been shown to increase the ability of muscle cells to use fatty acids and generate energy. Transgenic mice with overexpressed PPARδ were shown to be able to run on a treadmill twice the distance compared to normal mice. Conversely, PPARδ knockout mice were shown to run approximately 30% less distance compared to normal mice. We believe that a selective agonist of PPARδ such as mavodelpar, has potential therapeutic benefits while avoiding some of the adverse events associated with approved PPAR agonists of the PPARα and PPARγ class.

Disease overview
 PMM background
 PMM are a group of disorders caused by genetic mutations within the mtDNA or nDNA that affect the activity of enzymes or other proteins in the mitochondria. In PMM these genetic alterations hamper the ability of mitochondria to generate energy from nutrient sources, resulting in energy deficits that are most pronounced in tissues with high energy demand such as muscle, brain, and heart. Energy deficits can affect major muscle groups that are used for walking, climbing, lifting objects, and maintaining posture. Patients with PMM report chronic fatigue and a lack of endurance. Functional muscle impairment is also evident in smaller muscle groups that control, for example, movements of the eyes and eyelids and alterations in other muscles of the face and neck, which can lead to difficulty with swallowing and, more rarely, slurred speech.

Within each mitochondrion there are maternally inherited circular DNA molecules, mtDNA, that is inherited in a unique way such that within each cell there can be variable amounts of both mitochondria with mutated and non-mutated genes. These mtDNA genes code for thirteen proteins critical to cellular energy metabolism. Pathogenic mutations in mtDNA lead to a spectrum of diseases and physiological dysfunctions. This is due to several factors including the variability in prevalence of the mutated versus non-mutated genes within each cell across various tissues in the body. Myopathy is one of the most common clinical manifestations of disease in patients with PMM and can be a debilitating feature because muscle impairment, lack of endurance and exercise intolerance affect mobility and limit the capability of patients with PMM to perform day-to-day activities.
 There are currently no approved therapies for the treatment of PMM, representing a high unmet medical need.
 LC-FAOD background
 LC-FAOD are a type of inherited genetic errors of metabolism resulting in the inability to use dietary long-chain fatty acids as energy sources in the mitochondria. Fatty acids are metabolized in the mitochondria through OxPhos. Mitochondria have specific enzymes that break down each of the fatty acids to produce ATP. Mutations in the genes encoding the enzymes that break down long-chain fatty acids may lead to severe energy deficits. Specific deficiencies include defects in very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), LCHAD, mitochondrial TFP, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT). Patients need at least partial enzyme activity to survive into adulthood. Patients with the most severe defects in these enzymes have a high mortality rate. The most severe cases of LC-FAOD are diagnosed within the first few days or weeks of life. These patients often present with a severe energy deficit that results in lethargy, liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, encephalopathy, and high risk for sudden death. Older patients usually present with lack of endurance, poor exercise tolerance, muscle aches, rhabdomyolysis or breakdown of muscle tissue and are at risk of developing kidney injury. Patients with LC-FAOD are instructed to avoid fasting, eat frequent meals and, in some cases, supplement with creatinine and medium chain triglycerides (MCT), in order to maintain sources of energy for oxidative metabolism. In June 2020, a new form of MCT called DOJOLVI® (triheptanoin) was approved in the United States as a source of calories for patients with LC-FAOD. However, DOJOLVI® has not demonstrated clear functional benefits on endurance in randomized, controlled clinical trials. We are not aware of any drug interventional studies underway or currently announced for LC-FAOD.
 Our Solution, Mavodelpar
Mavodelpar is an oral, small molecule selective PPARδ agonist designed to modulate genes critical to metabolism and generation of energy. Mavodelpar is designed to selectively activate PPARδ receptors found in the nuclear membrane of muscle and other cells. PPARδ is a member of a family of nuclear receptors that regulate cellular energy generation by modulating the expression of genes that control proteins involved in mitochondrial enzyme activity and the formation of new mitochondria (mitochondrial biogenesis). PPARδ is highly expressed in muscle cells and activation of PPARδ either through genetic manipulation or through small molecule agonists has been shown to increase the ability of muscle cells to use fatty acids as well as improve muscle strength and exercise tolerance. We believe these are the mechanisms by which mavodelpar will act to help patients with mitochondrial diseases.
 By selectively targeting PPARδ, mavodelpar may address the cellular energy deficit in patients with genetic mitochondrial myopathies such as PMM and LC-FAOD by:
 •Increasing OxPhos activity of mitochondria resulting in enhanced production of ATP;
 •Increasing the formation of mitochondrial biogenesis and thereby increasing residual OxPhos activity and subsequent ATP production; and
 •Increasing the proportion and/or absolute number of functioning mitochondria which may compensate for poorly functioning or non-functional mitochondria.

To date, mavodelpar has been administered to more than 380 subjects across 10 clinical trials.
 Experiments in cell lines derived from patients with genetic mitochondrial myopathies have shown that increasing respiratory chain enzyme (complex I, III or IV) levels and activity can compensate the underlying energy deficit. Agonism of PPARδ can increase the activity of these respiratory chain enzymes.
 In addition, pharmacological upregulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in patients with PMM may result in improved energy generation. PPAR agonists have been shown to activate genes that play a central role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis. We believe that activation of these genes may alleviate the ATP deficient state in patients with genetic mitochondrial myopathies by increasing mitochondrial mass through enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis.
 In preclinical models, administration of mavodelpar led to a concentration-dependent increase of FAO and an increase in expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Similarly, data from a prior Phase 1 clinical trial of mavodelpar in healthy volunteers who were randomized to receive 4 weeks of treatment with 100 mg mavodelpar orally twice-daily (n=12) or placebo (n=12) showed increased expression of PPARδ regulated genes. Compared to placebo, analysis of muscle biopsies from mavodelpar treated volunteers showed substantial changes in known PPAR regulated target genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and new mitochondria formation.
 We have received orphan drug designations for mavodelpar in the United States for PMM and LC-FAOD. Additionally, we have received orphan drug designations for mavodelpar for mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and neurological stroke-like episodes (MELAS), a form of PMM, and LCHAD, a form of LC-FAOD in Europe. As further clinical data becomes available, we plan to apply for additional orphan designations in the United States and Europe.
 We have received Fast Track designation for mavodelpar for the treatment of patients with PMM and LC-FAOD due to LCHAD deficiency, one of the predominant LC-FAOD genotypes.
 Mavodelpar for the Treatment of PMM
 Phase 1b clinical trial in PMM
 We completed an open-label Phase 1b trial of mavodelpar in patients with PMM due to mtDNA defects. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mavodelpar, and mavodelpar was generally well-tolerated. We selected patients with PMM due to mtDNA defects and excluded patients with PMM due to nDNA defects to reduce heterogeneity in the study. Also, in contrast to patients with PMM due to nDNA defects who have all their mitochondria affected, patients with PMM due to mtDNA defects harbor both normal and mutated mitochondria within their cells (heteroplasmy). In patients with PMM due to mtDNA defects, mavodelpar has the potential to improve the function of affected mitochondria and to increase the overall function of otherwise normal mitochondria. This could potentially happen by impacting mitochondrial biogenesis or by improving mitochondrial function, resulting in improved cellular energy levels for patients with PMM.
 The Phase 1b trial was conducted in two parts: Part A (12 weeks dosing) and Part B (optional 36-week treatment extension). All patients were dosed orally with 100 mg mavodelpar once daily. A total of 24 patients were enrolled and 23 patients received mavodelpar in Part A. The planned maximum treatment duration for each patient in both Part A and Part B was 48 weeks. The Phase 1b trial was closed early as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the point of trial closure, a total of 17 patients had completed Part A, 13 patients had entered Part B, and the maximum duration of treatment was approximately 40 weeks. This Phase 1b trial was an open-label study; therefore, was not designed to show statistical significance as compared to a placebo control arm.

Figure 4. Mavodelpar PMM Phase 1b trial enrollment
 


To evaluate changes in patient function, we used a 12-minute walk test (12MWT). We believe that the 12MWT is an ideal assessment of functionality in patients with genetic mitochondrial diseases who commonly lack endurance as the latter half of the exercise period permits the evaluation of patients as they move from P-Cr and carbohydrate metabolism into FAO in the mitochondria.
 There were 114 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) experienced by 21 out of 23 subjects, with 66 of the 114 TEAEs (57.9%) experienced by 15 subjects which are considered related to study drug. The majority of these TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly reported TEAEs were constipation and headache. Two patients had elevations of creatine phosphokinase of moderate severity that were possibly or probably related to study drug.
 Physical performance measures
 Baseline 12MWT in the Phase 1b trial was 603.2 meters. Following 12 weeks of 100 mg once-daily dosing with mavodelpar, patients achieved an average increase of 104.4 meters (95% CI: 53.1, 155.6) in distance walked during the 12MWT compared to baseline. An increase in distance walked was observed in 15 of 17 patients (88%), with 13 of 17 patients (76%) increasing by 50 meters or greater as illustrated in Figure 5a.

Figure 5a. Mavodelpar-treated patients with PMM had improved 12MWT distances after 12 weeks of treatment
 
The largest improvement in walk velocity during the 12MWT at week 12 occurred in the second half of the 12-minute period (Figure 5b), which we believe is consistent with mavodelpar’s mechanism of action. We expect mavodelpar to improve muscle cell energy by increasing mitochondrial OxPhos, and this process occurs several minutes into exercise (See Figure 1 above).
 Figure 5b. Mavodelpar-treated patients with PMM had the greatest improvement in walking velocity in the latter half of the 12MWT, consistent with the proposed mechanism of mavodelpar to stimulate fatty acid metabolism
 

An additional outcome measure in our Phase 1b trial was measurement of peak oxygen consumption (peak VO2) during maximal exercise. The amount of oxygen used during maximal exercise is a marker of aerobic capacity and is directly correlated with the ability to metabolize fatty acids which require higher amounts of oxygen than other energy sources such as carbohydrates. An average healthy person has a weight-adjusted peak VO2 of 35 to 40 mL/min/kg for males and 27 to 30 mL/min/kg for females. A weight-adjusted peak VO2 of 14 mL/min/kg or lower has been determined to predict increased mortality in other patient populations (congestive heart failure).
 Baseline weight-adjusted peak VO2 in the Phase 1b trial was 14.6 mL/min/kg. Following 12 weeks of 100 mg once-daily dosing with mavodelpar, patients achieved an average increase in weighted average peak VO2 of 1.7 mL/min/kg (95% CI: -0.329, 3.665) compared to baseline (Figure 5c).

Another outcome measure was the sub-maximal exercise test. This test is conducted using a stationary bike for 30 minutes of cycling at 60% of the patient’s maximal capacity. At baseline, 7 of the 17 patients (41%) were able to complete the 30-minute test compared to 11 of 17 patients (65%) after 12 weeks of mavodelpar treatment. Overall, a mean improvement of approximately 3 minutes was observed at week 12 compared to baseline, with no increase in heart rate or perceived exertion.
 A 30-second sit-to-stand (30STS) test was also performed. The 30STS test measures lower extremity strength and endurance which are needed for daily activities such as climbing stairs, getting out of a chair or bathtub, or rising from a horizontal position. Patients are asked to stand from a sitting position in a chair as many times as possible in 30 seconds and to do so without the use of their arms. At baseline, the patients with PMM in our Phase 1b trial were able to perform this task 6.9 times, which is worse than the typical performance of an elderly person in his or her late 80s. After 12 weeks of treatment with mavodelpar, patients were able to complete the task 8.5 times. Because this test is completed in only 30 seconds, the improvement in performance is more likely due to increased muscle strength rather than improvements in FAO. As shown in Figure 5d below, approximately 40% of patients with PMM showed improvements in lower extremity muscle strength and stamina after 12 weeks of mavodelpar treatment as evaluated with the 30STS test.
 Figure 5d. Patients with PMM showed improvements in lower extremity muscle strength and stamina after 12 weeks of mavodelpar treatment as evaluated with the 30STS test
 

Patient reported outcomes (evaluation of symptoms)
 The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item questionnaire that assesses general health including physical activities, mental health, pain, and properties such as energy and fatigue over four weeks. Each domain of the SF-36 can range from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing improvement. As illustrated in the right chart in Figure 5e, after 12 weeks of 100 mg once-daily dosing with mavodelpar, patients (n=17) had a mean improvement in the SF-36 energy/fatigue subscale from 28 at baseline to 39 at 12 weeks.
 The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) is a questionnaire that measures both the frequency and impact of fatigue on patients physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning over a 4-week period. The total MFIS score scales range from 0 to 84, with a lower score representing less fatigue. As illustrated in the middle chart in Figure 5e, after 12 weeks of 100 mg once-daily dosing with mavodelpar, patients (n=17) had a mean improvement in the MFIS score from 50 at baseline to 40 at 12 weeks.
 The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) measures the patient’s perception of pain and the degree that pain interferes with function over the past 24 hours. The BPI scales range from 0 to 10, with a lower score representing less pain. As illustrated in the left chart in Figure 5e, after 12 weeks of 100 mg once-daily dosing with mavodelpar, the patients that reported pain at baseline (n=14), had a mean improvement in the BPI severity scale from 4.5 at baseline to 3.5 at 12 weeks.
 Figure 5e. Mean change from baseline to week 12 in patient reported outcome questionnaires in patients with PMM participating in the Phase 1b trial
 
Muscle biopsies (evaluation of gene expression)
 Muscle biopsies were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment with mavodelpar to evaluate changes in gene expression (mRNA). Differential gene expression was performed on biopsies from seven subjects that had sufficient sample quantity and quality for analysis at baseline and week 12. As shown in Figure 5f, a statistically significant increase over baseline was observed in the expression of Pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4), Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), and Solute carrier family 25 member 34 (SLC25A34).

Clinical development plans in PMM
 Based on these results, we initiated the STRIDE study, a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal Phase 2b trial of mavodelpar in adult patients with PMM due to mtDNA defects. We achieved the target enrollment of 200 patients in the pivotal STRIDE study in March 2023 and anticipate announcement of topline results in the fourth quarter of 2023. STRIDE study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 100 mg mavodelpar administered once-daily over a 24-week period. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is the change from baseline in the distance walked during the 12MWT at week 24. Key secondary endpoints include changes from baseline in the MFIS measures and the patient global impression of change scale. Additional secondary endpoints include the 30STS test, step counts, patient global impression of severity scale, BPI, and additional patient-reported outcome measures.
 We are also conducting the STRIDE AHEAD study, a 24-month-year, open-label, long-term safety trial outside of the United States in patients with PMM due to mtDNA. STRIDE AHEAD study was recently amended to also allow enrollment of adult patients with PMM due to nDNA defects. Based on interactions with the FDA, EMA, and several other national regulatory agencies in Europe, we believe that positive results from the ongoing pivotal STRIDE and STRIDE AHEAD studies could potentially support registration of mavodelpar for adult patients with PMM due to mtDNA defects in the United States and Europe. We intend to submit the data from STRIDE, together with the long-term safety data from STRIDE AHEAD, to the FDA and the EMA in planned marketing applications in 2024.
 Mavodelpar for the Treatment of LC-FAOD
 Phase1b clinical trial in LC-FAOD
 We completed an open-label Phase 1b study in LC-FAOD adult patients with nDNA defects to assess the safety and tolerability of mavodelpar, and measure changes in functional test such as walk distance, exercise capacity and patient-reported symptoms that could serve as potential endpoints in future clinical studies. The study included patients with defective LCHAD, CPT2, VLCAD, or TFP.
 A total of 24 patients were enrolled, including patients with defective LCHAD (n=5), CPT2 (n=8), VLCAD (n=9), or TFP (n=2). We initiated the trial with a dose of 50 mg once-daily in the first three patients followed by 100 mg
once-daily in all subsequent patients. The LCHAD and CPT2 groups had the greatest improvement over baseline in 12MWT (73.7 and 51.9 meters, respectively).
 In the LC-FAOD Phase 1b study, mavodelpar was well tolerated. The most common adverse events experienced by patients were rhabdomyolysis (4 patients) and myalgia (4 patients), the majority reported to be mild or moderate in severity. Results of the 12MWT, SF-36 energy/fatigue domain score, and MFIS total score for patients who completed both baseline and week 12 are summarized in Figure 6. Symptom improvement is represented by an increase in SF-36 energy/domain score or a decrease in MFIS total score.

 LC-FAOD Natural History Study
 We also completed a 16-week, observational, non-interventional study in patients with LC-FAOD with different nDNA mutations to better understand the natural history of LC-FAOD and changes in patient function and symptoms over time (FORWARD). A total of 58 patients participated in the FORWARD study, including patients with defective LCHAD (n=16), CPT2 (n=30), or VLCAD (n=12).
 In the FORWARD study, the most common adverse events experienced by patients were rhabdomyolysis (7 patients) and COVID-19 infection (5 patients), the majority reported to be mild or moderate in severity. Results of the 12MWT, 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) vitality domain score, and MFIS total score for patients who completed both baseline and week 16 are summarized in Figure 7. Symptom improvement is represented by an increase in SF-12 vitality score or a decrease in MFIS total score.
 Figure 7. Mean (SE) baseline and week 16 change by genotype
 
Based on the results of the LC-FAOD Phase 1b study, in conjunction with the results of the FORWARD study, we intend to continue the development of mavodelpar for certain genotypes of patients with LC-FAOD. Results of the studies were presented at the International Network of Fatty Acid Oxidation Research and Management Conference in August 2022.
We have received Fast Track designation for mavodelpar for the treatment of patients with LC-FAOD due to LCHAD deficiency, one of the predominant genotypes. We are continuing to collaborate with the FDA and European regulatory agencies to advance the LC-FAOD program which will include patients with LCHAD as well as other genotypes. These discussions include obtaining alignment on the study design, patient population, and endpoints for the LC-FAOD program’s next clinical trial.
 Additional Clinical Trials for mavodelpar


 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial
 Limb impairment Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers
 In a prior placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial completed by vTv Therapeutics, 24 healthy volunteers were randomized 1:1 to receive 4 weeks of treatment with either 100 mg mavodelpar orally twice daily (n=12) or placebo (n=12). In the trial, all volunteers had one leg immobilized with a brace for the first 14 days to cause muscle atrophy and weakness. Changes from baseline in muscle strength and gene expression from muscle biopsies were evaluated at various timepoints throughout the clinical trial. Mavodelpar treated volunteers had substantially more leg strength than placebo treated volunteers immediately and one week after the removal of the leg brace. No serious adverse events (SAEs) related to mavodelpar were reported, and TEAEs were similar among subjects who received mavodelpar or placebo.

Figure 8. Results from the muscle strength test from a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers
 
In the description of the Phase 1 clinical results in Figure 8 above, a p-value represents the probability that random chance caused the result. For example, a p-value of 0.001 means that there is a 0.1% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to random chance. A p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 is a commonly used threshold for identifying statistically significant outcomes. The FDA’s evidentiary standard of efficacy when evaluating the results of a clinical trial generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05.
Muscle biopsies were collected and analyzed for mRNA of PPARδ-regulated genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function (Figure 9). Muscle biopsies obtained from mavodelpar treated individuals showed substantial increases in the mRNA of the following PPAR-regulated genes compared to placebo-treated controls:
 •PDK4 encodes a mitochondrial protein. This kinase plays a key role in regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism.
 •ANGPTL4 is a target of PPARs. The encoded protein is a serum hormone directly involved in regulating lipid metabolism.
 •SLC25A34 belongs to the SLC25 family of mitochondrial carrier proteins. Members of the solute carrier family 25 are known to transport molecules over the mitochondrial membrane.

Safety
 Overall, mavodelpar has been well tolerated in all clinical trials conducted and there have been no drug related deaths or SAEs reported to date. Most observed TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials where patients were randomized to mavodelpar or placebo, the incidence and severity of adverse events were similar among individuals who received mavodelpar or placebo.
 To date, mavodelpar has been administered to more than 380 subjects across 10 clinical trials.
 Preclinical Results and Plans
 A substantial package of preclinical data along with Phase 1 placebo-controlled clinical data was in-licensed from vTv Therapeutics. This package has been expanded through additional in vitro and in vivo studies to support the future registration of mavodelpar. In these studies, it has been observed that mavodelpar is a potent and selective agonist of PPARδ with an EC50 value of 31 nM for PPARδ and over 300-fold increased selectivity over PPARα and PPARγ. Mavodelpar has shown minimal or no activity against other ligand-activated nuclear receptors. These other receptors, including the liver X and farnesoid X receptors, were evaluated because they have a role in
regulating lipid homeostasis and energy metabolism. Mavodelpar has also been evaluated for these receptors in transcriptional assays with similar findings (Figure 10).

To access effects of mavodelpar on FAO, incubation of mavodelpar on XM5 human muscle cell line with mavodelpar demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase in FAO as shown in Figure 11 below.

In an in vivo experiment, administration of mavodelpar to mice led to increased expression of a number of FAO genes and genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis including PGC1α, a fatty acid transcriptional co-factor; CPT1B, the rate-limiting enzyme in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria; PDK4, a negative regulator of glucose metabolism; and UCP3, a carrier protein involved in regulating metabolic rate in muscle cells (Figure 12).

PPARα and PPARγ agonists have been approved for dyslipidemia and glycemic control in diabetes mellitus, respectively. Liver and cardiac toxicity associated with PPAR drugs have been observed. Certain non-selective PPAR agonists have shown carcinogenicity signals in preclinical studies. The FDA requires that two-year carcinogenicity studies be completed in rats and mice for PPAR agonists prior to conducting clinical trials longer than six months in duration due to observations of tumor formation in rodents (FDA Guidance for Industry Diabetes Mellitus: Developing Drugs and Therapeutic Biologics for Treatment and Prevention, February 2008). The purpose of carcinogenicity studies is to identify tumorigenic potential of a new drug candidate in rodents and to assess the relevant risk to humans.
 Reneo is conducting a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats and mice using low, medium and high doses of mavodelpar as well and control groups. These studies are being conducted according to FDA good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations. We expect results from both studies in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 We are unaware of any data suggesting that there is a clinical cancer risk with selective PPARδ agonists. CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of up to 52 weeks with seladelpar, a selective PPARδ agonist in patients with primary biliary cholangitis. Astellas Pharma Inc. is conducting a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of up to 52-weeks plus 24-weeks extension with bocidelpar, a selective PPARδ agonist. Collectively, this suggests that both seladelpar and bocidelpar have likely been cleared in two-year carcinogenicity studies and that there is no evidence of a carcinogenicity signal for the selective PPARδ agonist class. We are currently conducting the required two-year carcinogenicity studies with mavodelpar.
We have completed a 6-month toxicology study in rats and a 12-month toxicology study in primates. No adverse effects associated with PPARα or PPARγ agonists were observed with administration of mavodelpar at any dose level.
 Sales and Marketing
 We currently do not have a commercial organization for the marketing, sales, and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We plan to build a fully integrated rare genetic mitochondrial disease pharmaceutical company and will retain commercial rights to mavodelpar in the United States and key European markets. For other territories, we will seek strategic partnerships to bring mavodelpar to market with the goal of establishing mavodelpar as the standard of care around the world. We may also opportunistically seek strategic collaborations to benefit from the resources of biopharmaceutical companies specialized in either relevant disease areas or geographies.
 License Agreement with vTv Therapeutics
 In December 2017, we entered into a License Agreement with vTv Therapeutics (vTv License Agreement), under which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under vTv Therapeutics intellectual property relating to vTv Therapeutics’ PPARδ agonist program, to develop, manufacture and commercialize PPARδ agonists and products containing such PPARδ agonists, including mavodelpar, or licensed products, for any therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic application in humans.
Under the terms of the vTv License Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $3.0 million to vTv Therapeutics and issued to vTv Therapeutics shares of our common stock representing a minority interest in our outstanding equity. Upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, we are required to pay vTv Therapeutics milestone payments totaling up to $64.5 million. We are also required to pay vTv Therapeutics up to $30 million in total sales-based milestones upon achievement of certain sales thresholds of the licensed product. In addition, we are obligated to make royalty payments to vTv Therapeutics at mid-single digit to low teen percentage royalty rates, based on tiers of annual net sales of licensed products, subject to certain customary reductions. Such royalties will be payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patents covering a licensed product in a country, which are expected to expire in 2034, absent any patent term adjustments or extension, (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity rights for a licensed product in a country, which is expected to be five years of new chemical entity exclusivity upon approval of a licensed product, such as mavodelpar, in the United States, where such exclusivity would run concurrently with seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, if we are the first to receive marketing approval of a licensed product for an orphan disease or condition for which we have received orphan designation, such as approved orphan uses of mavodelpar for the treatment of patients with PMM and LC-FAOD, in the United States, and (iii) the tenth anniversary after the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country. In July 2021, a milestone under the vTv License Agreement was achieved, and we made a payment of $2.0 million to vTv Therapeutics.
 Under the terms of the vTv License Agreement, we have sole authority and responsibility for the worldwide development and commercialization of the licensed products, at our cost, subject to certain diligence obligations to use commercially reasonable efforts with respect to specified development and commercialization efforts, including seeking approval for and commercializing at least one product in two major markets.
 The vTv License Agreement, unless terminated earlier, will continue until expiration of the last to expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the vTv License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency. We may terminate the vTv License Agreement at will upon prior written notice. Upon expiration (but not earlier termination) of the vTv License Agreement, the licenses granted to us will survive on a royalty-free basis in perpetuity. Upon termination of the vTv License Agreement, we are required to, upon vTv Therapeutics’ request, (i) grant to vTv Therapeutics a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable license under our intellectual property solely for vTv Therapeutics and its sublicensees to develop, manufacture, and commercialize the licensed products for any therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic application in humans or (ii) if vTv Therapeutics agrees to pay us a low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products by vTv Therapeutics, then such license grant to vTv Therapeutics will be exclusive, and we will assign and transfer to vTv Therapeutics all regulatory materials and approvals related to the licensed product.
 Intellectual Property
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, mavodelpar, any future product candidates, and other proprietary technologies are important to our business. We strive to protect our product candidates and other proprietary technologies, processes and know-how through a variety of methods. In regard to our product candidates, we seek and maintain patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use for treating diseases, the processes for their manufacture, and, as our product candidates proceed through clinical studies, the innovations that arise from these efforts. As a result, we seek to obtain domestic and foreign patent protection and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions to expand our intellectual property portfolio. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights in strategic areas, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary know-how that may be important to the development of our business.
 We have developed and continue to expand our patent portfolio for mavodelpar. We have licensed from vTv Therapeutics eight issued patents in the United States and 19 issued patents in foreign countries covering composition of matter of mavodelpar, among other things, which are expected to expire in 2026, absent any
patent term adjustments or extensions. Additionally, we have licensed four issued patents in the United States, six issued patents in foreign countries, one pending application in the United States, and one pending application in Europe, from vTv Therapeutics covering methods of using mavodelpar, which are expected to expire in 2034, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 In addition to the licensed vTv Therapeutics patents and applications relating to mavodelpar, we have filed our own patent applications. We co-own one pending application in the United States and five pending applications in foreign countries, and own three pending applications in the United States, one pending international patent application, an issued patent in foreign country, and over 25 pending applications in foreign countries, directed to various methods of use of mavodelpar. These pending patent applications, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2040 and 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We also own one issued patent in the United States, one pending application in the United States, one pending international patent applications, and over 15 pending applications in foreign countries directed to methods of manufacturing, and crystalline forms (polymorphs) of mavodelpar. The issued patent, and pending patent applications if issued, are expected to expire in 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. Patents related to mavodelpar may be eligible for patent term extensions in certain jurisdictions, including up to five years in both the United States and the EU, upon approval of a commercial use of the corresponding product by a regulatory agency in the jurisdiction where the patent was granted.
 In addition, we currently have Orphan Drug Designation for mavodelpar for the treatment of LC-FAOD and PMM in the United States and LCHAD deficiency and MELAS in the EU, providing the opportunity to receive seven years of orphan exclusivity in the United States (upon approval of NDA), and ten years of market exclusivity in the EU and Japan (upon receipt of marketing authorization).
 As mavodelpar has not previously been approved in the United States for any indication, mavodelpar may be eligible for five years of new chemical entity exclusivity upon approval in the United States, where such exclusivity would run concurrently with its seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for its approved uses. Further, as mavodelpar has not previously been approved in the EU for any indication, mavodelpar may be eligible for eight years of data exclusivity upon approval in the EU, as well as two years of market exclusivity. In the EU, an additional one year of exclusivity may be obtained if mavodelpar is approved for a new indication that provides a significant clinical benefit.
 In addition to patent protection around mavodelpar, we have also licensed from vTv Therapeutics an issued patent in the United States directed to composition of matter around other PPARδ agonists, which is expected to expire in October 2023, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method of using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions from applicable authorities, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the United States, to any of our issued patents covering mavodelpar, and any future product candidates, in any jurisdiction where these patent term extensions are available. There is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual
Property.” We also seek to protect our intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with companies with whom we share proprietary and confidential information in the course of business discussions, and by having confidentiality terms in our agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators, and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of any discoveries or inventions made by them while in our employ.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information of our business that is not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We take steps to protect our proprietary information, including trade secrets and unpatented know-how, by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors. However, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed, and any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 Manufacturing
 We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to produce mavodelpar in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations for use in our clinical trials. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals for human use is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel training, and quality control. We obtain our supplies from these CMOs on a contract work order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. We believe there are multiple sources for all the materials required for the manufacture of mavodelpar. As mavodelpar advances through development, we expect to enter into longer-term commercial supply agreements with key suppliers and manufacturers to fulfill and secure our production needs. Our relationships with CMOs are managed by internal personnel with extensive experience in pharmaceutical development and manufacturing.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological advancement, significant competition and an emphasis on intellectual property. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with current therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and oncology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or less expensive than any products we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. We believe that the key competitive factors affecting the success of any of our product candidates, if approved, will include efficacy, combinability, safety profile, convenience, cost, level of promotional activity devoted to them and intellectual property protection.
 There are no approved therapies indicated for the treatment of PMM in any country. Physicians attempt to treat symptoms in patients with drugs or vitamins and supplements. For example, anti-convulsant drugs are used to prevent or control seizures. CymaBay Therapeutics, Inc. is conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial of up to 52 weeks with seladelpar, a selective PPARδ agonist in patients with primary biliary cholangitis. Astellas Pharma Inc. is conducting a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of up to 52-weeks plus 24-weeks extension with bocidelpar, a selective PPARδ agonist. Other companies are developing therapies for mitochondrial diseases, including, Stealth BioTherapeutics Corp., Abliva AB, Cyclerion Therapeutics, Inc., Khondrion B.V. and Minovia Therapeutics.
 There is one product approved in the United States for LC-FAOD. In June 2020, a new form of MCT called DOJOLVI® (triheptanoin) was approved and indicated in the United States as a source of calories for patients with LC-FAOD. However, DOJOLVI® has not demonstrated clear functional benefits on endurance in clinical trials. We are not aware of any drug interventional studies underway or currently announced for LC-FAOD.
 Furthermore, it is possible that other companies are also engaged in discovery or nonclinical development of product candidates for PMM or LC-FAOD. These competitors, if successful in clinical development, may achieve regulatory approval and market adoption in advance of our product candidates, constraining our ability to gain significant market share for such product candidates. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, will complete with multiple approved products or products that may be approved for future indications for which we develop such product candidate.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 As a pharmaceutical company we are subject to extensive regulation. Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state, and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing, and export and import of drug products such as those we are developing. Any drug candidates that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the EU are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects.
U.S. Drug Development Process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or
criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s GLP regulations, and other applicable regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s current good clinical practices (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA) for a new drug;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to file the NDA for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
 •potential FDA audit of the preclinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies, to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB or ethics committee, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in
relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion, the side effects associated with increasing doses and if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
 •Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases or conditions and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and dosing schedule.
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall benefit/risk ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
 In some cases, FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, that are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, such as with accelerated approval drugs, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final drug. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of
the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the investigational drug product to the satisfaction of the FDA. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes 12 months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions and typically follows the advisory committee’s recommendations.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process, and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or (an) additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-market studies or clinical trials. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug safety and effectiveness, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also determine that a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is
needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare genetic mitochondrial disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare genetic mitochondrial disease or condition.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a number of programs intended to expedite the development or review of products that meet certain criteria. For example, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development, and the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the
filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
 In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, manufacturing, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
 In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the drug product. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP requirements. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 •clinical holds on clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.

Marketing Exclusivity
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from accepting ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs referencing the approved application for review. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we are and, upon approval and commercialization, will be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. In the United States, such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, price reporting, and healthcare provider sunshine laws and regulations.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing, or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe
harbor. Additionally, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1966 (HIPAA) also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) annually report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers, and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, track, and report gifts, compensation and other remuneration made to physicians and other healthcare providers, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions
brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such drug products.
 In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We or our collaborators may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 If we elect to participate in certain governmental programs, we may be required to participate in discount and rebate programs, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. For example, drug manufacturers participating under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs. Under the Veterans Health Care Act (VHCA) drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Recent legislative changes require that discounted prices be offered for certain U.S. Department of Defense purchases for its TRICARE program via a rebate system. Participation under the VHCA also requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. If our products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In Europe, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. EU member states are free to restrict the range of pharmaceutical products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement, and to control the prices and reimbursement levels of pharmaceutical products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but
monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the Affordable Care Act) was enacted, which affected existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the "donut hole" under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is also unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act or our business.
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute will remain in effect until 2031, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In addition, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
There has also been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders, and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an
executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 We anticipate that certain reform measures will result in additional downward pressure on coverage and the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Data Privacy and Security
 In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal or sensitive data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, and guidance governing data privacy and security. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA) (collectively, the CCPA), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (EU GDPR), and the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (UK) law (UK GDPR). In addition to the CCPA, several other states within the United States, such as Virginia, Colorado, Utah, and Connecticut have enacted or proposed comprehensive privacy laws and similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal and local levels.
The CCPA and EU GDPR are examples of the increasingly stringent and evolving regulatory frameworks related to personal data processing that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any actual or perceived noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to correct or delete the individual’s personal data, and to opt out of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for administrative fines and a private right of action for certain data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, the CPRA’s recent amendments to the CCPA established a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law.
 Foreign data privacy and security laws (including, but not limited to, the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area (EEA) and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances;
increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances. Further, it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to long term. The UK’s Data Protection and Digital Information Bill was laid before the UK Parliament on July 18, 2022, introducing reforms intended to update and simplify the UK’s data protection framework, deviating from the EU GDPR. This may impose additional compliance costs on companies that operate in both the UK and the EU.
 See the section titled “Risk Factors” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we or our potential collaborators obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. Previously, in the EU, pursuant to the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) had to be submitted to each country’s national regulatory authority in which the clinical trial was to take place, together with an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Although the Directive had sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, EU Member States transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently, leading to significant variation in the regulatory regimes of the member states. In 2014, a new Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014, replacing the current Directive, was adopted. The new Regulation is directly applicable in all EU Member States (without national implementation) and entered into application on 31 January 2022. The new Regulation seeks to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Pursuant to the Regulation, the sponsor shall submit a single CTA via the EMA’s Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), which will cover all regulatory and ethics assessments from the member states concerned.
 Any submissions made from January 31, 2023 onwards must be made through CTIS and all trials authorized pursuant to the Directive that are still ongoing on January 31, 2025 have their details registered on CTIS, in both cases trials registered on CTIS will have to comply with the Regulation. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a member state's requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Approval and monitoring of clinical trials in the EU is, as it was under the Directive, the responsibility of individual member states, but compared to the position prior to the applicability of the Clinical Trials Regulation there is likely to be more collaboration, information-sharing, and decision-making between member states. The new Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements, such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to a new EU Database.

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union (EU) must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines on GCP as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a CTA from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 During the development of a medicinal product, the EMA and national regulators provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Scientific Advice Working Party of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs. Advice is not legally binding with regard to any future marketing authorization application (MAA) of the product concerned.
 To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product in the EU, we must submit a MAA either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 Centralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization (MA), which is issued by the European Commission based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA and that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, designated orphan medicinal products, and medicines that contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the Centralized Procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when the authorization of a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. Under the accelerated procedure the standard 210-day review period is reduced to 150 days.
 Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is however not guaranteed.

The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of a MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
 •National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure.
 •Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorizations in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU Member State and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
 •Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national MA.
 In the EU, upon receiving MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the European Commission or the national competent authority decides on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic/biosimilar application. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic/biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic/biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity and qualify for data exclusivity.
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the MAA. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as free protocol assistance, fee reductions for access to the centralized regulatory procedures and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval, which can be extended to 12 years if trials are conducted in accordance with an agreed-upon pediatric investigational plan. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs).
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such
risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 Great Britain (GB) is no longer covered by the EEA’s procedures outlined above following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on January 1, 2021 (Northern Ireland will be covered by the centralized authorization procedure and can be covered under the decentralized or mutual recognition procedures). A GB or UK MA will be required to market drugs in GB. However, for three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) may adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new marketing authorizations through the centralized procedure, and the MHRA will have regard to marketing authorizations approved in a country in the EEA (although in both cases a MA will only be granted if any GB-specific requirements are met). Various national procedures are now available to place a drug on the market in the UK, GB, or Northern Ireland, with the main national procedure having a maximum timeframe of 150 days (excluding time taken to provide any further information or data required). The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation), and after Brexit, new EU laws on clinical trials (including the EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EU CTR) are not applicable in GB. The UK may further diverge from the EU in relation to the regulation of medicinal products which could disrupt cross-border operations between the UK and EU. The Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill 2022, which is currently progressing through the United Kingdom Parliament and seeks to allow the UK Government to repeal or replace certain EU Law that was incorporated into UK law effective as of the end of the Brexit transition period, increases the likelihood of such divergence and will need to be closely monitored going forward. Already, as a result of Brexit various benefits of membership no longer apply to the UK, for example, UK sponsored trials that span several EU countries now need to have an individual or organization in the EU to act as a legal representative, or sponsor and the UK does not have access to new EU clinical trial databases such as CTIS pursuant to the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Additionally, new rules apply to the import of investigational medicinal products from the EU and EEA to GB. The data exclusivity periods in the UK are currently in line with those in the EU, but the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides that the periods for both data and market exclusivity are to be determined by domestic law, so there could be divergence in the future.
 The UK regulatory framework in relation to orphan drug designation is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation). The European Commission is currently evaluating new legislation in relation to orphan medicines and these laws will no longer be applicable in GB. Since January 1, 2021, there has been no route to obtain pre-MA orphan designation in GB, however, as a result of the implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, EU orphan drug designation and time periods of market
exclusivity still remain valid for marketing products in Northern Ireland. Instead, the MHRA now reviews applications for GB orphan designation in parallel with the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same as under the EU regime, but have been tailored for the GB market, i.e., the prevalence of the condition in GB (rather than the EU) must not be more than 5 in 10,000. For medicinal products that have received orphan status on or after January 1, 2021, a period of 10 years orphan market exclusivity is awarded from the date of MA by the MHRA. An additional two years of exclusivity may be added where pediatric data requirements have been met. Products with an orphan designation in the EU may be considered for a GB orphan MA. However, where centrally authorized MAs have an existing EU orphan designation, these have been converted into GB MAs and shall continue in effect with the remaining period of orphan market exclusivity.
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Employees
 As of March 21, 2023, we employed 48 employees, 36 of whom are full-time. At the same date, 29 of our employees were located in the United States and 19 were located in the UK. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 We expect to continue to add employees in 2023, with a focus on expanding our clinical, research and development and commercialization capabilities. We continually evaluate the business need and opportunity to expand our team and balance in-house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. Currently, we outsource substantial clinic trial work to clinical research organizations and drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers.

Emerging Growth Company
 We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act). We may take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements, including being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure, not being required to have our internal control over financial reporting audited by our independent registered public accounting firm under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these exemptions until December 31, 2026 or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier. We will cease to be an emerging growth company
prior to the end of such period if certain earlier events occur, including if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), our annual gross revenues exceed $1.235 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period.
 In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.
 We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.
