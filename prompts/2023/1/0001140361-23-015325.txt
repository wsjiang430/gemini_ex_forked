General
 
Tandy Leather Factory, Inc. (“TLF,” “we,” “our,” “us,” the” Company,” “Tandy,” or “Tandy Leather” mean Tandy Leather Factory, Inc., together with its subsidiaries) is one of the world’s largest specialty retailers of leather and leathercraft-related items.  Founded in 1919 in Fort Worth, Texas, the Company introduced leathercrafting to millions of American and later Canadian and other international customers and has built a track record as the trusted source of quality leather, tools, hardware, supplies, kits and teaching materials for leatherworkers everywhere.  Today, our mission remains to build on our legacy of inspiring the timeless art and trade of leatherworking.
 
What differentiates Tandy from the competition is our high brand awareness and strong brand equity and loyalty, our network of retail stores that provides convenience, a high-touch customer service experience, and a hub for the local leathercrafting community, and our 100-year heritage.  We believe that this combination of qualities is unique to Tandy and gives the brand competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate.
 
We sell our products primarily through company-owned stores and through orders generated from our global websites, and through direct account representatives in our commercial division.  We also manufacture leather lace, cut leather pieces and most of the do-it-yourself kits that are sold in our stores and on our websites.  We also offer production services to our business customers such as cutting (“clicking”), splitting, and some assembly.  We maintain our principal offices at 1900 Southeast Loop 820, Fort Worth, Texas 76140.
 
The Company’s common shares currently trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market  under the symbol “TLF.”
 


  
Retail Fleet
 
The Company currently operates a total of 103 retail stores. There are 92 stores in the United States (“U.S.”), ten stores in Canada and one store in Spain.
 
All Tandy locations, other than our corporate headquarters (which includes our flagship store, corporate offices, distribution center, and manufacturing facility) are leased.
 
Business Strategy
 
Tandy Leather has been introducing people to leatherworking for over 100 years.  Our stores have been, and continue to be, our competitive advantage: where our consumers learn the craft in classes, open table, and from the expertise of our store staff, where they can touch, feel, and test the product, and where they can connect and commune with others passionate about leather.  Our websites provide inspiration, detailed product descriptions and specifications, educational information and videos, and a convenient place to also purchase product – especially for those who are far from our retail stores, including a growing international customer base.  For many of our retail and web customers, leatherworking evolves from a passion to a trade.  Our commercial division is tailored to the needs of those customers who build businesses around leather.  With dedicated direct account representatives, a direct-from-our-warehouse shipping model, bulk and volume-based competitive pricing, customized product development, and production and pre-production services, we are building long-term, strategic relationships with our largest customers.
 
In 2019, with the arrival of a new management team, we began the process of assessing and reinvigorating the business.  We focused in three broad strategic initiative areas: 1) improving our brand proposition, 2) rebuilding our foundation: the talent, processes, tools and systems needed to modernize and efficiently operate the business, and 3) creating a vision and road map for long-term growth.  We had significant achievements in all of these areas including significantly improving the product quality, breadth of assortment and value, dramatically improving the website and web operations, rebuilding the team, people policies and culture, and replacing all of the key systems, among many other accomplishments.
 
We made this steady progress to transform and reinvigorate our business even in the face of two very significant obstacles.  In 2019, as part of the assessment of the business, we discovered errors in accounting that required a restatement of our financials.  This work was costly and time-consuming, but we successfully completed the restatement in 2021 along with implementation of new accounting systems, redesign of processes and controls, and a significant upgrade in the team.  In 2020, while making progress against our transformation and still working through our restatement, we temporarily closed all of our retail stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
 With COVID-19-related impacts and the restatement behind us and with many of our initiatives taking hold, we are now focused on improving our financial sustainability and profitability.  In the short term, we are managing operating expenses and gross margin to deliver cash from operations and operating income even in the face of possible continued economic headwinds.  We will also continue to selectively invest in profitable sales growth where it makes sense, but rebuilding a durable, profitable business model is the highest priority.


COVID-19 and Economic Conditions
 
At the time of filing this Form 10-K, the American and world economies continue to be acutely affected by a combination of factors arising from both the COVID-19 pandemic and the war resulting from the invasion of Ukraine by Russian military forces. The current impacts of these events include (but are not limited to) levels of inflation that are the highest in the U.S. in more than 40 years, highly volatile fuel prices, an extremely tight labor market with rising wages and competition to attract qualified workers, supply chain disruption, rising rent and other occupancy costs and increases in interest rates.  Purchases of non-essential, discretionary products tend to decline in periods of uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, such as the current one, as disposable income declines.  The Company believes that these events have continued to dampen its sales through December 2022.  The future remains uncertain, and continued increased labor, freight, product, and other costs as well as weakening customer demand could have a negative impact on the Company’s future financial performance.
Customers
 
Our customers fall into 2 broad categories: those who shop in retail stores and on our website (“Retail Customers”) and those whom we serve through our commercial division (“Commercial Customers”).  Retail Customers range from hobbyists to institutions (schools, camps, and other groups) to small businesses.  Affinity groups like Military and First Responders and smaller and larger businesses who purchase in our retail stores receive special pricing or general discounts.  To be served through our commercial division, customers generally need to spend more than $20,000 per year and receive pricing based on their purchasing levels.
Merchandise
 
We carry a wide assortment of products organized into a number of categories including leather, hand tools, hardware, kits, liquids, machines, and other supplies.  We operate a manufacturing facility in Fort Worth, Texas, where we manufacture kits, thread lace, belt strips and straps, and Craftaid®s, and provide some custom manufacturing processes for commercial and business customers.  The factory produces approximately 10% of our products.  We distribute product under the Tandy LeatherTM, Eco-FloTM, CraftoolTM, CraftoolProTM and Dr. Jackson’sTM brands, along with our premium TandyPro® line of products.  We develop and invest in new products through the ideas and referrals of customers and store personnel as well as the analysis of trends in the market and sales performance at retail.  In addition, we have been focused on broadening our assortment through strategic partnerships with key brands to drive category growth and better meet the needs of our customers.
Operations
 
Information regarding net sales, gross profit, operating income, and total assets is included within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and within Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
 
Our stores offer a broad selection of products combined with leathercraft expertise in a one-stop shop.  Not only can customers purchase leather, related accessories and supplies necessary to complete their projects from a single source, but many of our store associates are also leathercrafters themselves and can provide suggestions and advice on our customers’ projects.  Customers value the expertise and high level of customer service from our store associates, the convenience of taking their purchases immediately, as well as the ability to touch, feel and choose their individual pieces of leather, an organic product in which each piece is unique.  We also offer open workbenches where customers can work on projects, take classes, commune with the leathercrafting community, and test new tools and techniques.
 
Most of our stores range in size from 1,300 square feet to 9,000 square feet, with the average at approximately 3,500 square feet. Our Fort Worth flagship store is approximately 22,000 square feet.  Stores are located in light industrial warehouse spaces or older strip shopping centers in proximity to major freeways or well-known crossroads.  We believe that many of our customers view our stores as a destination: customers interested in leathercrafting seek us out, reducing the value of paying high rents for high foot-traffic locations.
 
Historically, we generate slightly more sales in the fourth quarter of each year due to the holiday shopping season (approximately 28-30% of annual sales), while the other three quarters average approximately 22-24% of annual sales each quarter.
 


  
Distribution
 
Our stores receive the majority of their inventory from our central distribution center located in Fort Worth, Texas, in weekly or, increasingly, bi-monthly shipments, using third-party transportation providers.  Occasionally, merchandise is shipped to stores directly from the vendor.  We now fulfill all of our U.S. and many of our international web orders from our Fort Worth distribution center.  Canada web orders are fulfilled out of our 10 Canada stores, and European web orders are fulfilled out of our Spain store.  We have a global customer service team that handles web order inquiries and phone orders.  Our goal is to optimize the tradeoff between the sales and market share we realize from having a broad product line against the safety stock required to support those items.  We generally maintain higher inventories of imported or long-lead-time items to ensure a continuous supply.  Our inventory levels have grown as we have increased our product assortment to improve conversion and retention of customers and to mitigate out-of-stocks, especially during the supply chain disruptions over the last 2 years.  In the face of overall supply chain challenges, we have opportunistically taken advantage of some vendor offers on key items, accounting for some increase in inventory. And we have also been executing a number of strategic initiatives to test smaller quantities of new items online, buying into them only when we are certain of their success, to tailor product assortments to the needs of local customers in each store, and to ship directly from vendors to customers.  We carry about 6,500 stock-keeping units (SKUs) in our current product line and continue to refine both the line, the lead times and safety stock levels required to meet customer demand, online vs. in-store assortment, and overall total inventory levels needed to grow sales and market share.
Competition
 
Our competitors are typically smaller, independently-owned brick-and-mortar retailers, internet-based retailers including those selling on platforms like Amazon and eBay, national craft chains like Michaels Stores, Inc. and Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., and some wholesale-focused distributors.  Virtually all of these competitors carry a more limited line of leathercraft products compared to Tandy.  We are competitive on convenience, price, availability of merchandise, customer service, depth of our product line, and delivery time.  Tandy Leather is the only multi-store chain specializing in leathercraft, which we believe provides a competitive advantage over internet-based retailers and the large general craft retailers.  We also believe that our large size relative to most competitors gives us an advantage in sourcing as well as deep product and leathercrafting expertise among our employees.
Suppliers
 
We purchase merchandise and raw materials from over 130 vendors from the United States and approximately 20 foreign countries.  In general, our 10 largest vendors account for approximately 30% of our inventory purchases.
 
Because leather is sold internationally, market conditions abroad are likely to affect the price of leather in the U.S.  Aside from increasing purchases when we anticipate price increases (or possibly delaying purchases if we foresee price declines), we do not attempt to hedge our inventory costs.
 
Our supply chain and vendor relationships remain strong.  We are focused on continuing to align our product and sourcing strategies to elevate the overall quality, consistency, and agility to meet the diverse needs of our existing consumers and attract new ones to the brand.  The most acute supply chain shocks resulting from the pandemic have mostly moderated, with increases in lead times, product costs and ocean freight costs flattening and even declining in some areas.  However, trucking costs and reliability remain volatile and tight labor markets continue to pressure costs across all areas.
 


  
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Our compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 605 people, 494 of whom were employed on a full-time basis.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.  Overall, we believe that relations with employees are good.
Intellectual Property
 
The Company owns all of the material trademark rights used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all Tandy-branded products.  In addition, we license a limited number of our trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition co-branded projects.  Major trademarks include federal trade name registrations for “Tandy Leather Factory,” “Tandy Leather Company,” and “Tandy.”  The Company is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent, although it believes that the “Tandy” and “Tandy Leather” names are important for its business.  In addition, Tandy owns several patents for specific belt buckles and leather-working equipment.  Tandy polices its trademarks and trade dress and where appropriate pursues infringers.  The Company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as we continue to use and renew them.
