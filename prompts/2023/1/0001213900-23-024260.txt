Overview



We are focused on developing tecarfarin, a novel therapy with orphan drug indication, designed for the prevention of systemic thromboembolism (blood clots) of cardiac origin in patients with end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, and atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat), or AFib. We secured the rights to tecarfarin on April 1, 2022 via an asset purchase agreement from HESP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Horizon Technology Finance Corporation. HESP LLC acquired the assets of Espero BioPharma, Inc., or Espero, including tecarfarin, in an assignment for the benefit of creditors in which the creditor, Horizon Technology Finance Corporation and Horizon Credit II LLC (collectively, Horizon), a secured lender of Espero, designated HESP LLC as the assignee of Espero’s assets.



Tecarfarin is an anticoagulant that uses a drug design process which targets a different pathway than the most commonly prescribed drugs used in the treatment of thrombosis and AFib. Tecarfarin has been evaluated in eleven (11) human clinical trials conducted by its previous owners and other third parties in over 1,003 individuals (269 patients were treated for at least six months and 129 patients were treated for one year or more). In Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 2/3 clinical trials, tecarfarin has generally been well-tolerated in both healthy adult subjects and patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD. In the Phase 2/3 trial, EMBRACE-AC, the largest tecarfarin trial with 607 patients having completed it, only 1.6% of the blinded tecarfarin subjects suffered from major bleeding and there were no thrombotic events. Five patients died during the trial, but only one death due to intracerebral hemorrhage was considered to be possibly related to the tecarfarin.



In 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, provided input on the Phase 3 trial design for tecarfarin, which was submitted by Espero, the previous owner of tecarfarin. We intend to submit our Phase 3 trial design to the FDA using the same protocol that was submitted by Espero. Assuming the FDA accepts our Phase 3 trial design, we intend to commence the Phase 3 pivotal trial in the first half of 2024. However, there can be no assurance that the trial design will be accepted by the FDA. We are pursuing regulatory approval of tecarfarin as an individual treatment, although we might evaluate, in consultation with the FDA, other potential uses in the future.



In March 2019, the FDA granted orphan drug designation, or ODD, for tecarfarin for the prevention of systemic thromboembolism of cardiac origin in patients with ESRD and AFib. The FDA grants ODD status to drugs that are intended for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of rare diseases or conditions, which are defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. The ODD program provides a drug developer with certain benefits and incentives, including a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity from the date of marketing authorization, waiver of FDA user fees, and tax credits for clinical research. The granting of an orphan drug designation does not alter the FDA’s regulatory requirements to establish safety and effectiveness of a drug through adequate and well-controlled studies to support approval and commercialization. Furthermore, orphan drug designation does not indicate or guarantee FDA approval of the New Drug Application, or NDA, and we might not receive exclusivity.



Tecarfarin was developed by researchers using a retrometabolic drug design process which targets a different metabolic pathway than the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of thrombosis and AFib. “Drug metabolism” refers to the process by which a drug is inactivated by the body and rendered easier to eliminate or to be cleared by the body. Most approved drugs, including warfarin, the only FDA-approved Vitamin K antagonists, or VKAs, which is a prescribed drug for the treatment of thrombosis, are metabolized in the liver through a pathway known as the Cytochrome CYP450 system, or CYP450, by the enzymes known as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. By using a different metabolic pathway, tecarfarin eliminates or minimizes the CYP450 metabolism in the liver. Patients taking multiple medications that interact with CYP2C9, or CYP3A4 or those with impaired kidney function, can experience an overload in the pathway, creating a bottleneck that often leads to insufficient clearance, which results in a toxic build-up of one or more drugs. In some instances, patients taking multiple medications metabolized by the same CYP450 pathway may experience decreased efficacy of one or more of the medications due to rapid metabolism or increased drug effect and/or toxicity due to enzyme induction. Patient-specific genetic differences can also hinder drug clearance in the CYP450 pathway. Our product candidate tecarfarin was designed to follow a metabolic pathway distinct from the CYP450 pathway and is metabolized by both CYP450 and non-CYP450 pathways. We believe this may allow elimination by large capacity and non-saturable tissue esterase pathways that exist throughout the body rather than just in the liver.



Tecarfarin is an orphan designated, vitamin K antagonist, oral, once-daily anticoagulant in the same drug class as warfarin designed for use in patients requiring chronic VKA anticoagulation, to prevent systemic thromboembolism of cardiac origin in patients with ESRD and AFib. The prevailing treatment for thrombosis is with an oral anticoagulant, either a VKA, like warfarin, or non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (“NOAC”). VKAs block the production of vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors, such that the blood is “thinned,” preventing clots, while NOACs directly block the activity of certain of these clotting factors. Tecarfarin, like warfarin, is a VKA.

Vitamin K epoxide Reductase Complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) is a significant enzyme for effective clotting. VKORC1 reduces vitamin K epoxide to its active form (Vitamin K), which is the rate-limiting step in the physiological process of vitamin K recycling. Vitamin K serves as a cofactor for normal function of several clotting/anticoagulation factors including Factors II, VII, IX and X and Proteins C, S, and Z. VKORC1 genetic deficiencies result in increased sensitivity to VKAs, which results in an increase in the risk of significant hemorrhaging. We believe tecarfarin has similar potency for VKORC1 inhibition as warfarin, but it is an investigational new drug, and we must demonstrate it is safe and effective for its proposed indication.






AFib is the most common arrhythmia, with its incidence and prevalence increasing over the last 20 years. AFib is associated with an approximate five-fold increased risk of stroke. The risk of developing AFib increases in patients with CKD. According to 2021 estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, approximately 15% of the U.S. adult population, or 37 million people, have CKD. An estimated 0.4% of people in the U.S. suffer from Stage 4 CKD and 0.1% of people in the U.S. have ESRD.



Patients with ESRD and AFib represent a spectrum of disorders involving both the heart and kidneys (known as cardiorenal syndrome or CRS) in which acute or chronic dysfunction in one organ may induce acute or chronic dysfunction in the other organ. These patients have typically been excluded from randomized clinical trials because the approved therapies for AFib have metabolic profiles that may increase drug exposures thereby increasing the known risks and challenges in managing these patients. The presence of either CKD or AFib, increases the risk of serious thromboembolic adverse clinical outcomes, such as stroke and death. Antithrombotic therapy is typically recommended to decrease this risk in AFib patients, but there are no approved treatment options for patients with ESRD and AFib. Warfarin may cause substantial harm in these patients. Low-dose apixaban (Eliquis) was approved by the FDA for use in ESRD patients on hemodialysis based upon limited pharmacokinetic data by 8 subjects, despite that randomized trials to date of apixaban versus warfarin for AFib excluded patients with severe and end-stage kidney disease. The RENAL-AF (Trial to Evaluate Anticoagulation Therapy in Hemodialysis Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) was terminated early in 2019 by its sponsor.



There are more than 809,000 Americans with ESRD, with approximately 70% on dialysis, according to the United States Renal Data System. Approximately 150,000 ESRD patients also have AFib. AFib nearly doubles the anticipated mortality and increases the stroke risk by approximately five-fold in these patients. There is evidence that AFib is an independent risk factor for developing ESRD in CKD patients. Both diseases share common risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, and advancing age. Cardiovascular disease contributes to more than half of all deaths among patients with ESRD. According to the Annual Data Report published by the United States Renal Data System, total Medicare spending for patients with ESRD reached $51 billion in 2019, accounting for approximately 7% of the Medicare paid claims costs.

We have licensed out the rights to tecarfarin for several Asian markets including China, to Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, an integrated research-driven and market-oriented biopharmaceutical publicly listed company based in Hong Kong with over 25 years’ experience in the pharmaceutical industry in China. Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited is developing tecarfarin as an anti-thrombotic for patients with mechanical heart valves. In 2020 and 2021, Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited completed two Phase 1 studies in China and Hong Kong and is currently preparing for its Phase 2 trial.

Members of our management team have extensive experience in drug discovery, development and commercialization and have held senior leadership positions at a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We also benefit from our broad network of established relationships with leaders in the industry and medical community.



As more fully set forth in our risk factors, we are a clinical development biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have a history of operating losses and expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Our cash and the proceeds from our initial public offering will only fund our operations for a limited time. The proceeds from our initial public offering are insufficient to allow us to fully fund our planned pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial. We will need to raise additional capital for the initiation of enrollment of patients and completion of the planned pivotal Phase 3 trial.



With respect to tecarfarin, we have two issued U.S. patents directed to tecarfarin. While the patents currently expire in 2024, we expect to seek extensions of patent terms. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). We also intend to seek exclusivity for our proprietary product candidates through market and data exclusivity granted by regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries. Further, as discussed above, the ODD program provides a drug developer with certain benefits and incentives, including a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity from the date of marketing authorization.



While we have engaged intellectual property counsel to assist in protecting our patent ownership rights, to date, we have not had intellectual property counsel conduct a freedom to operate analysis regarding our tecarfarin product. As a result, we cannot be certain that we will not be exposed to third party legal claims, liabilities and/or litigation actions when we seek to develop, make and market products using our tecarfarin technology.



Clinical Trials



Tecarfarin has been evaluated in 11 human clinical trials in over 1,003 individuals which includes eight Phase 1 trials, two Phase 2 trials and one Phase 2/3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tecarfarin.

In a Phase 2/3 randomized and blinded trial sponsored by ARYx Therapeutics, Inc. in 2008, 607 patients with indications for chronic anticoagulation were treated with either tecarfarin or warfarin. The Time in Therapeutic Range, or TTR, with tecarfarin was similar to that with well-managed warfarin and tecarfarin appeared to have a favorable safety profile and be well tolerated with only 1.6% of the blinded tecarfarin subjects suffering from major bleeding and no thrombotic events. When thrombotic and major bleeding events during the blinded period were combined, a numerical imbalance favoring tecarfarin over warfarin was seen (warfarin 11 subjects, 3.6%; tecarfarin 5 subjects, 1.6%). The trial however did not meet its primary endpoint as superiority of tecarfarin over warfarin as measured by TTR was not demonstrated.



In a subsequent Phase 1 study with 23 patients with CKD sponsored by Armetheon, Inc. in 2016, the metabolism of warfarin was inhibited, but not tecarfarin. The safety of repeated dosing of tecarfarin in CKD patients remained unknown. However, if the pharmacokinetic findings of this single-dose study are present with repeated dosing, tecarfarin may lead to dosing that is more predictable than warfarin in CKD patients who require anticoagulation therapy.



Recent Events



Fast Track Designation



On January 13, 2023, the FDA designated as a Fast Track development program the investigation of tecarfarin for the prevention of systemic thromboembolism of cardiac origin in patients with ESRD and AFib. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.
Initial Public Offering



On January 24, 2023, we completed our initial public offering of 1,400,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share, generating gross proceeds of $7,000,000. Our shares of common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) on January 20, 2023 under the symbol “CVKD.”



In connection with our initial public offering, on January 19, 2023, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Boustead Securities, LLC, as representative of the underwriters (the “Representative”), a form of which was previously filed as an exhibit to our registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File No. 333-267562), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 19, 2023 (the “Registration Statement”). Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, we agreed to issue to the underwriters a five-year warrant (the “Representative’s Warrant”) to purchase an aggregate of 84,000 shares of our common stock, which is equal to six percent (6%) of the shares of common stock sold in the initial public offering. Such Representative’s Warrant has an exercise price of $6.00, which is equal to 120% of the public offering price of the common stock in the initial public offering.



In connection with the closing of the initial public offering, we entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors (we had previously entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers). The indemnification agreements, in addition to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, require us to indemnify our directors, executive officers and certain controlling persons to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.

Our Strategy



Our goal is to build a biopharmaceutical company with a foundation of product candidates that significantly advance patient care in cardiorenal diseases. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:

● | Complete the clinical development of and seek FDA approval for tecarfarin. We intend to initiate our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the first half of 2024, subject to completion of our initial public offering and funding from additional financings, which we believe will be our remaining pivotal trial based upon the latest feedback that the prior owner of tecarfarin had with the FDA in 2019. ACTOR AF: Anti-Coagulation with Tecarfarin on Outcomes in Renal disease and Atrial Fibrillation is designed as a Phase 3, 492-patient, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Outcomes Study of Tecarfarin vs. Placebo in Subjects with End-Stage Renal Disease and Atrial Fibrillation not Currently Treated with Chronic Oral Anticoagulation. If we are able to complete the Phase 3 clinical trial and we are able to obtain FDA approval of our NDA, we believe tecarfarin can be an alternative treatment for patients who are currently without an approved treatment.

● | If we obtain FDA approval of our NDA for our first indication, we intend to seek to expand the label for tecarfarin through a supplemental NDA. We intend to explore the full potential of tecarfarin in additional indications, including the treatment of patients with Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) and Mechanical Heart Valves (MHVs) who require chronic anticoagulation. A LVAD is an implantable pump attached to the heart, connecting the apex of the left ventricle to the ascending aorta. LVADs are intended to treat patients suffering from advanced heart failure. MHVs are a type of prosthetic heart valve constructed of durable materials such as titanium or carbon that can potentially last a patient’s lifetime. Despite their high durability, MHVs are associated with an increased risk of developing blood clots that may interrupt blood flow and travel to various organs (thromboembolism). Oral anticoagulation therapy with a vitamin K antagonist (warfarin) continues to be the recommended treatment option for patients implanted with an MHV based on the 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Guidelines.

● | We intend to partner and/or in-license and/or acquire clinical and pre-clinical stage cardiorenal products to augment our current pipeline which consists of one investigational product. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Create a commercial infrastructure for our product candidates. If tecarfarin is approved by the FDA, we intend to expand our commercial infrastructure and hire and train a focused and dedicated specialty cardiorenal salesforce which we believe can efficiently cover the top prescribing physicians and approximately 3,000 anticoagulation clinics in the U.S., which presently monitor patients on warfarin. If approved, we intend to initially target our tecarfarin commercialization efforts at the two largest dialysis providers in the U.S., DaVita Kidney Care and Fresenius Medical Care. DaVita maintains more than 2,800 brick-and-mortar dialysis centers in the U.S., while Fresenius’ North America subsidiary owns more than 2,500 on the continent — together accounting for more than 70% of the entire U.S. market.

Retrometabolic Drug Design Process



We utilize a retrometabolic drug design process to design product candidates that follow a metabolic pathway that we believe will confer significant clinical advantages over existing drugs metabolized by the CYP450 pathway. “Drug metabolism” refers to the process by which a drug is inactivated by the body and rendered easier to eliminate or to be cleared by the body. Most approved drugs are metabolized in the liver through the CYP450 pathway by the enzymes known as CYP2C9 and CYP3A4. The CYP450 metabolic pathway has limited capacity, and patients taking multiple medications that interact with CYP2C9, or those with impaired kidney function, can experience an overload in the pathway, creating a bottleneck causing insufficient clearance, which results in a toxic build-up of one or more drugs. In some instances, patients taking multiple medications that interact with CYP2C9 may also experience that a drug is eliminated too quickly from the body, reducing the efficacy of the drug. Patient-specific genetic differences can also hinder drug clearance in the CYP450 pathway. Our product candidates were designed so that they follow a metabolic pathway distinct from or in addition to the CYP450 pathway, eliminating or minimizing the CYP450 metabolism by the liver, and are instead or additionally eliminated by large capacity and non-saturable tissue esterase pathways that exist throughout the body rather than just in the liver. We believe that the use of these alternative pathways can minimize the impact of drug-to-drug interactions, impaired kidney function and genetic variability, on the metabolism of our drugs, thereby ultimately minimizing clearance-related safety issues.





7







As part of the retrometabolic design process, we first design a metabolite, which we refer to as the “ideal metabolite,” that is non-toxic, pharmacologically inactive, water soluble and rapidly eliminated from the body through a pathway distinct from the CYP450 pathway. This ideal metabolite becomes the foundation upon which we develop a limited series of potential molecular drug candidates that have the same pharmacology and function as the original drug. We then test the potential drug candidates we have created preclinically to assess whether the candidates have the same activity as the original drug and to ensure the candidates break down properly to the ideal metabolite. This process allows us to identify the drug candidates that would be best suited for further clinical development.



By designing drugs that break down to the ideal metabolite, and accordingly, are not cleared through the CYP450 pathway, we create product candidates that we believe would reduce many of the safety risks and complications that patients experience with drugs that are cleared through the CYP450 pathway. As a result, we believe there may be better compliance with a tecarfarin treatment regimen, if approved by FDA, which may also result in increased efficacy for the patients taking our drug product candidates.



Our Investigational Product Candidate



Tecarfarin for Use in Patients with ESRD and AFib



ESRD and AFib Current Treatment Landscape



Thrombosis is the formation or presence of a blood clot (a thrombus) within a blood vessel that blocks normal blood flow. A formed thrombus can detach from the vessel or heart atrium wall, resulting in a thromboembolism that causes a blockage of the blood flow to vital organs, such as the brain, heart and lungs. According to the CDC, each year, approximately 800,000 people in the U.S. experience a new or recurrent stroke, of which approximately 87% are ischemic strokes, which are caused by either a thrombotic event or embolism, in which blood flow to the brain is blocked. In addition, the CDC estimates that as many as 900,000 people in the U.S. could be affected by venous thromboembolism (blood clotting in the veins) or a pulmonary embolism (blood clotting in the lungs) each year.



The American Heart Association estimates that 5 million Americans suffer from heart-valve disease, which forces the heart to work harder to pump blood and can lead to heart failure and sudden death. The disease can be present at birth or result from infections, heart attacks or other heart conditions. Further, more than 182,000 heart valve replacements are performed every year in the U.S. Mechanical heart valves also create a risk of thrombotic events.



The prevailing treatment for patients at risk of thrombosis is an oral anticoagulant, or OAC, of which there are two common types: vitamin K antagonists, or VKAs, and non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants, or NOACs.



Vitamin K Antagonists: Warfarin



Vitamin K antagonists, or VKAs, are substances that block the production of vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors such that the blood is “thinned,” preventing clots. VKAs are used as anticoagulants in the treatment of thrombosis. For patients treated with a VKA, the international normalized ratio, or INR, a system established by the World Health Organization and the International Committee on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, is a commonly available, inexpensive measure of the body’s coagulation status. Each VKA patient’s dose must be individualized, based on a target range for his or her INR test. The percentage of time that a patient’s INR is maintained within his or her target range is known as the time in therapeutic range, or TTR. TTR is a well-established FDA metric used to evaluate anticoagulation control (safety and efficacy) of a VKA based on prothrombin time and the INR. When used as a therapy, VKAs are titrated to a patient’s individual INR range and that patient is expected to visit a clinic for regular INR monitoring. A higher TTR reflects better anticoagulation control and is related to improved clinical outcomes, including rates of death, bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke and systemic embolism, and a TTR measure of ≥ 70% is generally accepted as the goal for stable anticoagulation with a VKA. When patients are above their individual INR range, they are at higher risk for bleeding, due to reduced clotting ability, while patients are below their target INR range are at higher risk for thrombotic events. Potential benefits of monitoring INR include ascertaining patient compliance with their drug treatment regimen, the ability to detect when dose adjustments are needed and maintaining safety and efficacy of the drug treatment. TTR is predictive of adverse events, including mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction.

As depicted in the chart below, higher TTR is generally correlated with higher survival rates.






Source: Currie et al. Heart 2006 (92) 196-200



Higher TTR levels are also associated with better kidney functioning, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as reported by the Journal of the American Heart Association in 2017.






VKAs are reversible, meaning that in cases of over-anticoagulation, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma, or a combination, can be administered to bring patients back down into their INR range.



Warfarin is currently one VKA treatment option for thrombosis in the U.S. and has been in use since the 1950s. However, as reported by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, there are many adverse events associated with warfarin, including bleeding, skin necrosis and hair loss, and warfarin has been reported as number three on the list of drugs implicated in adverse effects causing hospital admission due to its many drug-to-drug interactions. Due to these side effects and the increasing use of NOACs, the use of warfarin has decreased during the last decade.

Limitations of Warfarin Treatment



Warfarin has significant safety risks stemming from its metabolic process, including its elimination pathway. Other drawbacks of warfarin are widely recognized such as narrow therapeutic range, slow onset and offset of action causing difficulty to manage during peri-invasive procedures, and multiple drug and food interactions.



Warfarin’s efficacy and safety profile are affected by its metabolism and elimination characteristics and various interactions with other drugs. Warfarin is metabolized through the CYP450 pathway, primarily by the CYP2C9 enzyme, and approximately 15% of clinically used drugs are metabolized by the same enzyme, including certain anticoagulants, antiplatelets and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS. Patients taking warfarin and on CYP2C9 interacting drugs may experience either or both of, warfarin being eliminated by the body too quickly, thereby decreasing its anticoagulation effect, or warfarin being eliminated by the body too slowly, resulting in excessive and dangerous thinning of the blood. In both of these situations, increased monitoring is required and dose adjustments are often necessary. Patients who take both warfarin and these CYP2C9 interacting drugs also have an increased risk of being outside their individual INR target range and experiencing lower or higher TTR. For these patients, their CYP2C9 interacting drugs must be used with caution, or at times, their use must cease.



Warfarin’s efficacy and safety profile are also affected by genetic mutations that lead to a lower activity of the CYP2C9 enzyme, the primary enzyme used to eliminate warfarin from the body. Clinical studies have shown that these persons require lower dosages of warfarin and are at an increased risk of anticoagulation.



Currently, warfarin is commonly used in patients with non-valvular AFib and in patients with valvular heart diseases (VHD) with AFib. However, as reported by an article published by the Egyptian Heart Journal on March 28, 2022, an analysis of 6,454 patients with AFib taking warfarin showed that almost 50% of the time the INR was outside the target range of 2–3, leading to a higher risk of bleeding and thrombotic complications. The major adverse effect associated with warfarin is bleeding. Major and fatal bleeding events occur at rates of 7.2 and 1.3 per 100 patient-years, respectively, according to a meta-analysis of 33 studies.



INR should be more frequently monitored in patients with impaired kidney function. Patients with impaired kidney function have a decreased ability to metabolize drugs through the CYP450 pathway, and accordingly have an increased risk of being outside their individual INR target range and experiencing lower TTR. Further, according to an article published by Frontiers in Medicine in January 2021, warfarin was associated with an increase in the risk of major bleeding without reduction in stroke/thromboembolism or mortality in patients with end-stage CKD requiring dialysis.



As a result of some or all of the above, and other factors, trials have shown that patients treated with warfarin often experience TTRs lower than 70%, the generally accepted TTR threshold representing stable anticoagulation. In a 2019 study conducted to evaluate the TTR of 300 patients on long-term warfarin for non-valvular AFib, as reported by an article published in Health and Quality of Life Outcomes on October 20, 2020, 75.5% of patients had a poor TTR with a mean of only 39.5%, with the mean TTR of all patients in the study being 47%. In another study of 406 AFib patients conducted in Lithuania to evaluate the quality of warfarin as anticoagulation therapy, more than half (57.3%) of INR values were outside of the target range and the median TTR was only 40%, with only 20% of patients having a TTR greater than or equal to 65%.



Non-Vitamin K Oral Anticoagulants (NOACs) or Direct Acting Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)



Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants, or NOACs, or DOACs, are a form of OAC treatment that inhibits certain blood clotting factors. While VKAs block the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent blood clotting factors, NOACs block the activity of these clotting factors. There are two classes of NOACs, oral direct thrombin inhibitors and oral direct factor Xa inhibitors. Currently, there are only four NOACs approved by the FDA for use outside of a hospital setting: apixaban (the generic name for Eliquis), dabigatran (the generic name for Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (the generic name for Xarelto) and edoxaban (the generic name for Savaysa). NOACs are generally more rapid in onset and offset of action than VKAs, have few strong drug-to-drug interactions and do not require INR monitoring.



Limitations of NOAC Treatment for Patients with ESRD and AFib



NOACs have been approved in the U.S. for the treatment of specific oral anticoagulation indications; however, there are anticoagulation indications for which NOACs are warned against use or are not recommended for use, including for anticoagulation treatment in patients with mechanical heart valves. NOACs do not have the same broad label indication as warfarin and are only indicated for some thrombosis indications.





10







Our Proposed Solution: Tecarfarin for Treatment of ESRD and AFib



Tecarfarin, our lead investigational product candidate, is a VKA, once-daily OAC designed for use in patients with ESRD and AFib. Tecarfarin was designed using a retrometabolic drug design which targets a different metabolic pathway than the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of thrombosis and AFib. Like warfarin, tecarfarin will also require INR monitoring. Due to its retrometabolic design, tecarfarin is eliminated by large capacity and non-saturable tissue esterase pathways that exist throughout the body, rather than just in the liver. This is a metabolic pathway that is distinct from the CYP450 pathway and infrequently used by other medications, which could potentially reduce the risk for drug-to-drug interactions. Moreover, unlike warfarin, we do not believe tecarfarin’s metabolism is affected by CYP2C9 genetic variant alleles or by kidney function.



Given the metabolic process and related safety issues with warfarin and the limited treatment indications for which NOACs are approved, we believe there is a significant thrombosis patient population in need of an alternative anticoagulation treatment. The lack of stable and predictable anticoagulation control is particularly problematic in large underserved patient subpopulations with risk factors such as:




● | Patients treated with CYP2C9 interacting drugs; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients with severely impaired kidney function; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients with genetic variant alleles for CYP2C9; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients with mechanical heart valve implants.

Tecarfarin Clinical Program



Tecarfarin has been evaluated in eleven clinical trials: eight Phase 1 trials, two Phase 2 trials and one Phase 2/3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of tecarfarin. We are currently planning to commence what we believe to be our remaining pivotal Phase 3 trial in the first half of 2024. A readout of the two-year animal carcinogenicity study is expected to be completed in first half of 2024. We will also conduct any further trials as may be required by the FDA.

Phase 2 Trials



CLN-504: Trial CLN-504 was an open-label study in which 66 patients with AFib were treated with tecarfarin for a period of six weeks, with the option of continuing treatment for an additional six weeks. The trial, which was conducted by our predecessor company that owned the rights to tecarfarin, was primarily designed to determine an optimal dosing regimen and monitoring schedule and to describe the efficacy and explore the quality of anticoagulation as measured by TTR for INR. Before the trial, warfarin-treated patients had a mean TTR of 59.4%. After the initial three weeks of dose titration, the tecarfarin-treated patients were within the target INR range 71.4% of the time (p<0.001). The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events, or TEAEs, were mild hemorrhagic complications of anticoagulation, such as bruising and nosebleed.



There were two deaths after trial drug treatment was completed: one patient died due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonia two weeks following his last dose of tecarfarin, and one patient died due to bronchial carcinoma two weeks following his last dose of tecarfarin. These deaths were not attributed to tecarfarin.



CLN-509: The CLN-509 trial was a pilot Phase 2 study to assess clinical trial methodology to be used in CLN-505, in patients having a variety of clinical indications requiring chronic oral anticoagulation, as measured by INR. Fifty patients, including patients with AFib, some of whom were already taking warfarin and some of whom had not, received daily doses of tecarfarin ranging from 1 mg to 60 mg to maintain their INR value (the INR varied based upon the patient’s condition). The objectives of evaluating safety and INR control in patients with a variety of clinical indications for chronic oral anticoagulation and assessing the feasibility of tecarfarin treatment in multiple dose strengths were met. INR control was shown for patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolic disease, prosthetic heart valves, and cardiomyopathy. There were no off-target adverse events due to tecarfarin and there were no clinically important safety signals in other measures of safety. The results of this trial resulted in the development of the clinical trial methodology for the Phase 2/3 trial (EMBRACE-AC).



CLN-505 (EMBRACE-AC): The Phase 2/3 CLN-505 trial, referred to as the EMBRACE-AC trial, was a multi-center, randomized, stratified, double-blind, parallel group, active control trial for a minimum period of six months and up to one year designed to compare the quality of anticoagulation of tecarfarin and warfarin as determined by TTR. Dosing of study drugs was managed by a centralized dose control center. In total, 609 patients were enrolled and of those, 607 patients completed the trial and of these, 304 patients received warfarin and 303 patients received tecarfarin. The EMBRACE-AC trial did not achieve statistical significance on its primary endpoint and the results of the primary analysis showed that tecarfarin was not superior to warfarin as measured by TTR. However, the TTR observed in patients taking tecarfarin (72.3%) was numerically similar to patients taking warfarin (71.5%) (difference of 0.8%; p=0.51).

As part of its original design, the EMBRACE-AC trial included analyses of INR measurements while patients were temporarily off their trial drug due to other medical reasons. Subsequently a post-hoc analysis was conducted in which we excluded INR values collected during these periods and showed that the percentage of TTR was higher on tecarfarin (68.8%) than on warfarin (66.4%) (difference of 2.3%; p<0.04).



Post-hoc analyses were conducted in other patient subgroups in our EMBRACE-AC trial. The following chart depicts the findings of the analysis of the study and the degree to which TTR% on tecarfarin was higher than on warfarin:







● | In the 179 patients taking CYP2C9 interacting drugs, the TTR of patients taking tecarfarin was similar to that of patients taking warfarin (72.2% and 69.9%, respectively; p=0.15). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the 55 patients taking CYP2C9 interacting drugs who also had a CYP2C9 genetic variant allele, the TTR of patients taking tecarfarin was similar to that of patients taking warfarin (76.5% and 69.5%, respectively; p=0.09).

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The potential benefit of tecarfarin over warfarin as measured by TTR was not demonstrated in EMBRACE-AC. However, the TTR observed in patients taking tecarfarin in the trial, and in the subpopulations described above, were numerically similar to the TTR observed in the patients taking warfarin, and the TTR observed in patients taking tecarfarin demonstrated stable anticoagulation. The TTR in patients treated with warfarin exceeded previously reported TTR rates observed in patients taking warfarin, which are typically in the 50% to 65% range, which we believe was due to the use of dose control centers in the administration of the trial. When dose control centers are used in the administration of warfarin, large teams of medical professionals are able to closely monitor patients and mitigate many of the drug-to-drug and genetic variant-related limitations of the drug that are not easily managed in real world settings.



EMBRACE-AC also provided information for dosing and dose adjustments for tecarfarin. The average daily doses required of both tecarfarin and warfarin was analyzed in patients who had poor, intermediate or extensive metabolism capacity of the CYP2C9 enzyme. Patients with poor metabolism capacity of the CYP2C9 enzyme who were treated with warfarin required a significantly lower average daily dose compared to those patients with extensive CY2C9 enzyme metabolism capacity. In contrast, as depicted below, the required dosage of tecarfarin did not vary significantly based on the patient’s CYP2C9 activity level.








13







Tecarfarin appeared to be well tolerated with only 1.6% of the blinded tecarfarin subjects suffering from major bleeding and no thrombotic events. When thrombotic and major bleeding events during the blinded period were combined, a numerical imbalance favoring tecarfarin over warfarin was seen (warfarin 11 subjects, 3.6%; tecarfarin 5 subjects, 1.6%). The safety data from EMBRACE-AC showed comparable rates of adverse events between the two treatment groups. TEAEs were reported for 93.2% of patients who received tecarfarin and 90.5% of patients who received warfarin. TEAEs reported by ≥10% of patients in either treatment group were nasopharyngitis (18.6% and 19.3%, blinded tecarfarin and warfarin, respectively), contusion (15.6% and 14.8%, respectively), epistaxis (8.1% and 11.1%, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (10.7% and 10.8%, respectively), diarrhea (10.1% and 9.2%, respectively) and headache (10.7% and 8.9%, respectively). Most TEAEs were mild (32.2%, tecarfarin and 30.2%, warfarin) or moderate (45.0% and 46.6%, respectively) in severity.



The trial had some limitations. The TTR with warfarin achieved in Embrace-AC was much higher than that typically seen in clinical trials and as compared to “real-world practice,” exceeding 71% on an interpolated basis in both treatment arms. The most likely reason stemmed from the dosing of study drugs which was managed by a centralized dose control center, which had access to genotyping.



Five patients died during the trial, with four deaths occurring during the double-blind period: one patient (tecarfarin; off drug) died due to mantle cell lymphoma, pneumonia and sepsis; one patient (tecarfarin; on drug) died due to cardiorespiratory arrest and myocardial infarction; one patient (warfarin; off drug) died due to metastatic colon cancer; one patient (warfarin; off drug) died due to lung cancer; and one patient (not randomized) died due to intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient who died due to intracerebral hemorrhage was considered to be possibly related to the study drug, but the remaining four deaths were not attributed to the drug.



During the blinded period of the trial, five patients on tecarfarin and six patients on warfarin experienced major bleeding events. The occurrence of major bleeding events for both tecarfarin and warfarin was lower when compared to prior anticoagulation trials. Among warfarin-treated patients, there were five thrombotic events (two ischemic strokes, two deep vein thromboses and one pulmonary embolism), while there were no such events among tecarfarin-treated patients.



Phase 1 Trials



CLN-501: Trials CLN-501 and CLN-501.X evaluated the safety tolerability of tecarfarin in a total of 64 healthy volunteers. The studies were sufficiently similar in their requirements and study populations to be combined and analyzed together. The primary differences between the studies were the study drug formulation (CLN-501 used a solution formulation while study 501.X used tablets) and the range of single doses studied. In CLN-501, cohorts of 6 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive tecarfarin at one of eight ascending dose levels between 0.2 and 10.0 mg or placebo. In CLN-501.X, similar cohorts received tecarfarin at one of three ascending dose levels (20.0, 30.0, or 40.0 mg) or placebo. The studies demonstrated that there were no apparent differences between pharmacokinetics parameters after tecarfarin was administered at single doses from 0.2 to 10.0 mg as an oral solution or at single doses from 20.0 to 40.0 mg as an oral solid tablet formulation and that tecarfarin was well-tolerated.



CLN-502: Trial CLN-502 evaluated tecarfarin pharmacokinetics, dose range, and duration of dosing that would attain a stead steady state INR of 1.7 to 2.0 and would give stead-state plasma concentrations of tecarfarin. Forty-two healthy volunteer subjects were randomized and received either 1, 3, 6, 10, 20, 30, or 40 mg of tecarfarin or placebo (the 3 and 6 mg cohorts were discontinued after one week due to lack of pharmacodynamic effect). The study successfully determined the active dose of tecarfarin and provided the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic basis for subsequent multidose trials. Doses of 20 mg and above brought subjects into the target INR range of 1.7 to 2.0, with the 40 mg dose bringing all subjects into the target range within one week of dosing. The trial demonstrated that tecarfarin was well-tolerated at all doses studied as assessed by adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiography, and laboratory testing, and that a loading dose of 40 mg could be appropriate for initiating anticoagulation in Phase II trials.



CLN-503: Trial CLN-503 evaluated the safety and tolerability of tecarfarin versus warfarin when administered alone and in combination with amiodarone as measured by INR in 28 healthy subjects. During the first phase, subjects were administered tecarfarin or warfarin for 10 days, with doses titrated daily to achieve a target INR range of 1.5 to 2.0. Subjects who remained within the target INR range without requiring a dose change continued to the next phase with amiodarone, with all subjects receiving 200 mg amiodarone twice daily in addition to tecarfarin or warfarin. The primary objectives of the trial were completely met. Both tecarfarin and warfarin were well-tolerated, both alone and in the presence of amiodarone. There were no safety signals as ascertained by adverse event reports, clinical laboratory testing, vital sign measurement, and by electrocardiography. The quality of anticoagulation was good for both cohorts and a target INR was reached and maintained during the 3-day maintenance period. The results of the trial suggested the use of the same INR therapeutic range for tecarfarin as is recommended for warfarin.

CLN-507: Trial CLN-507 evaluated the effects of co-administration of fluconazole, a drug that blocks the activity of the CYP450 enzyme, with either 50 mg tecarfarin or 17.5 mg warfarin in 20 healthy volunteers. The trial demonstrated that co-administration of fluconazole did not affect the metabolism or elimination of tecarfarin. In contrast, the co-administration of fluconazole prolonged the half-life of warfarin.



CLN-512: Trial CLN-512 evaluated the effects of severe chronic kidney dysfunction on the metabolism and elimination of tecarfarin and warfarin. Thirteen patients with severe kidney dysfunction (stage 4 chronic kidney disease, or CKD) and 10 healthy volunteers (matched for age, weight, gender and CYP2C9 genotype) were administered 30 mg tecarfarin and 10 mg warfarin in a randomized crossover design. The trial demonstrated that tecarfarin’s elimination from the body was not affected by severe kidney dysfunction: the half-life and the amount of drug in the body were similar in people with CKD and healthy patients. In contrast, the plasma concentration and half-life of warfarin was increased in patients with CKD, with warfarin’s exposure increasing 44% in these patients. These effects were exaggerated in patients with CYP2C9 genetic variant alleles and in those who required concomitant CYP2C9 interacting drugs. At the conclusion of the trial, the safety of repeated dosing of tecarfarin in CKD patients remained unknown. However, overall, the results of this study suggest that no adjustment in the dose of tecarfarin is needed for patients with CKD.



CLN-508: Trial CLN-508 evaluated the effects of co-administration of 400 mg amiodarone with either 50 mg tecarfarin or 17.5 mg warfarin in 19 healthy volunteers, nine on tecarfarin and 10 on warfarin. Amiodarone, a drug used to treat irregular heartbeat, is a moderately potent inhibitor of CYP2C9 metabolism and is frequently used as a treatment for AFib in combination with warfarin. The effects of amiodarone on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin and tecarfarin showed that the exposure was increased to about the same extent for both drugs. The exposure of R-warfarin increased by 27% and the exposure for S-warfarin increased by 38%. The exposure of tecarfarin increased by approximately 31%. These changes in exposure did not result in any changes in INR in either the tecarfarin or the warfarin cohorts and demonstrated that tecarfarin behaved similarly to warfarin when administered in combination with amiodarone.



An Open-label, Phase 1, Sequential Cohort, Single-Dose Escalation Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability of Tecarfarin (ATI-5923) in Healthy Chinese Volunteers



Study Protocol: LP-HK-001 completed in July 2019



This was an open-label, phase 1, sequential cohort, single-dose escalation study conducted in China to assess the safety and tolerability of tecarfarin (ATI-5923) in healthy Chinese volunteers. The study site enrolled up to a total of 40 subjects. Ten (10) healthy Chinese subjects received tecarfarin (ATI-5923) at each dose level (i.e., 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg).



The safety assessment results of this study were consistent with the results of CLN-501 study, and there was no safety risk after single dose administration of 10mg~40mg tecarfarin. AEs with higher incidence rate included headache and dizziness, and such AEs were graded as mild in severity. Tecarfarin showed a promising safety and tolerability profile in Chinese subjects.



Based on the results in this open-labelled, single-dose escalation, phase 1 study of tecarfarin, the following conclusions were made:



Single dose administration of tecarfarin in dose level ranging from 10 mg to 40 mg had no clinically significant effect on coagulation function. However, a slightly increasing trend in INR and PT values were observed with dose escalation. A slightly decreasing trend in coagulation factors II, VII and X were observed with dose escalation. Tecarfarin showed a promising safety and tolerability profile in Chinese subjects. The results of this study warrant further multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies in the Chinese population. We do not believe we can extrapolate this data to other populations, including the United States, but other trials were performed in the U.S.



A Multiple-Dose, Safety and Tolerability PK/PD Study of Tecarfarin in Healthy Chinese Volunteers



Study Protocol: ZK-TEK-201905 completed in January 2021



This was a multiple-dose phase 1 pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study conducted in China to assess the safety and tolerability of tecarfarin in healthy Chinese volunteers. The study site enrolled up to a total of 40 subjects. Ten (10) healthy Chinese subjects received tecarfarin once-daily on fasting every morning for 14 days at each dose level (i.e., 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg).





15







Tecarfarin was well tolerated in Chinese volunteers without serious adverse events in both single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) studies. There was only one treatment related adverse event (hematochezia) that resulted in early withdrawal in the MAD 40mg cohort. Exposure levels of tecarfarin were generally dose proportional.



Summary of Tecarfarin Clinical Trials



Clinical and preclinical trials of tecarfarin have demonstrated lack of drug-to-drug interactions with tecarfarin, predictable clearance that is independent of CYP450 blood clotting factors and any genetic variation in these factors, and the lack of impact of kidney function on clearance of tecarfarin. In the largest and longest of the clinical trials, EMBRACE-AC, tecarfarin and warfarin were found to have similar major and overall bleeding risks. In EMBRACE-AC, warfarin-treated patients had five thrombotic events, while there were no such events among tecarfarin-treated patients. When thrombotic and major bleeding events were combined, a trend favoring tecarfarin over warfarin was seen (five tecarfarin patients (1.6%) compared to 11 warfarin patients (3.6%)). We will conduct further studies and intend to submit this data to FDA in the NDA.
Upcoming Pivotal Phase 3 Trial: CLN-515 (ACTOR AF)



In the second half of 2023, we intend to commence our Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of tecarfarin in subjects with ESRD and AFib not currently treated with chronic oral anticoagulation. The study will assess the safety and efficacy of evaluate the efficacy and safety of tecarfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0) in subjects with ESRD (stage 5 — eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 mm2) and AFib. Subjects must have chronic paroxysmal, persistent or permanent AFib documented. All subjects will undergo genetic testing for VKORC1 prior to randomization, which will also be used for stratification at the time of randomization. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either blinded tecarfarin or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Approximately 540 subjects (270 per arm) will be enrolled in the study.



An enrollment period of 15 months is anticipated. A 10% dropout rate (48 subjects) is anticipated resulting in 492 evaluable subjects. All subjects enrolled in the study will remain on study drug until the last subject enrolled completes a minimum of 12 months of therapy or until the required number of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (death, ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolus, and/or myocardial infarction) have been obtained, whichever is later. The primary efficacy assessment is time to first major adverse cardiovascular event, or MACE. There will be approximately 125 study sites in the United States and Canada, with other trial sites to be determined. Based upon internal statistical projections, assuming the Phase 3 clinical trial is powered at 80%, the study is expected to demonstrate a treatment effect of 25%.






Sub-License



Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited License



In September 2015, China Cardiovascular Focus Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Lee’s Pharmaceutical Holdings Limited, or LPH, entered into an agreement (the “LPH License”) with Armetheon for the license, development and commercialization of our tecarfarin compound in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Thailand (the “Territory”). In October 2017, Armetheon merged with Espero BioPharma, Inc., or Espero. The assets owned by Espero were assigned to HESP LLC in a court-approved assignment for the benefit of creditors. On April 1, 2022 we acquired from HESP LLC, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, the assets related to tecarfarin, including the LPH License. Under the terms of the LPH License, LPH provided a non-refundable up-front payment of $1 million and agreed, during the term of the agreement, not to develop, manufacture or commercialize a competitive product in the Territory. Conversely, we agreed not to develop, manufacture or commercialize a competitive product in the Territory. If all potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones under the LPH License are met, we are entitled to receive payments of approximately $52.0 million. In addition, we are also entitled to receive royalties between 9% to 15% of the net sales of tecarfarin in certain specified markets. The LPH License expires on a country-by-country basis within the Territory, upon the latest of the expiration of the last intellectual property covering the tecarfarin compound in such country of the Territory, or the twelfth anniversary of the first commercial sale of tecarfarin in such country of the Territory.

Manufacturing



We do not have a manufacturing infrastructure and do not intend to develop one. We intend to contract with third parties for the production and packaging of our products and product candidates. With respect to tecarfarin, we are negotiating a contract with a third-party contract pharmaceutical manufacturer to perform the work necessary to develop a validated manufacturing process and to scale up for commercial production. However, we have not entered into any long-term supply agreements or commercialization partnership with these vendors. We anticipate that certain of the manufacturing sites for our products and product candidates may be in locations outside of the U.S.



While the drug substances used in our product candidate are manufactured by more than one supplier, the number of manufacturers is limited. In the event it is necessary or advisable to acquire supplies from an alternative supplier, we might not be able to obtain them on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. It could also require significant time and expense to redesign our manufacturing processes to work with another company. If approved by the FDA, we anticipate that we will be able to enter into agreements with suppliers to formulate and distribute tecarfarin on commercially reasonable terms.



Sales and Marketing



If any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we intend to commercialize our products by leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure and hiring and training a small and dedicated cardiorenal salesforce to commercialize our products in the U.S., and possibly other major markets. In addition, we anticipate entering into a variety of distribution agreements and commercial partnerships in those territories where we do not establish an internal sales force, including if we expand outside of the U.S. We expect that our specialized commercial cardiovascular team would be comprised of experienced marketing and sales management professionals.
Market Opportunity



Based upon data of untreated patients with ESRD and AFib (40,823) and orphan drug pricing of $65 per day (or $23,400 annually) derived from a 2019 study commissioned by us (adjusted for inflationary increases in the per day pricing), and assuming that we receive FDA approval of tecarfarin, we estimate that the annual U.S. market revenue potential for tecarfarin is approximately $1 billion.
Competition



There have been several randomized trials to definitively assess the treatment effects of apixaban compared with VKAs in the population dependent on dialysis. The RENAL-AF (Trial to Evaluate Anticoagulation Therapy in Hemodialysis Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) was terminated early in 2019 by its sponsor. In addition, the AXADIA study (Compare Apixaban and Vitamin-K Antagonists in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation and End-Stage Kidney Disease), which is currently recruiting patients, will randomize patients to apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily versus phenprocoumon. The randomization of study drug and blinded event adjudication in these trials will help to minimize bias and confounding, and will better elucidate the risks and benefits of standard versus low-dose apixaban. Neither of these trials are adequately powered to address the important questions relating to intracerebral hemorrhage.



The development and commercialization of new drugs is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to developing our current product candidate, and we will face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. We are seeking to develop tecarfarin as a marketable VKA, once-daily OAC for chronic anticoagulation, and we are seeking to develop as a marketable oral drug for the treatment and prevention of refractory AFib. If we succeed in developing the lead indication or additional indications, we will face substantial competition. Existing anticoagulant treatments for thrombosis include warfarin and NOACs such as Pradaxa (dabigatran), Xarelto (rivaroxaban), Eliquis (apixaban) and Savaysa (edoxaban) for specific indications. The entry of the first generic NOACs, starting with Boehringer Ingelheim’s loss of U.S., Japanese and Canadian patent protection for Pradaxa (dabigatran) in November 2018 and the remaining NOACs by 2024, could increase competition and reduce the total dollars spent on the treatment of thrombosis, as a result of lower generic drug pricing. The next generation of anticoagulants in development, Factor XI inhibitors, are currently in Phase 2 studies.



Many of these named products are marketed by some of the largest and most successful pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The companies that market these products have substantially more resources than we do and substantially more experience developing and marketing pharmaceuticals. We may not be able to successfully compete with these existing products. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of competing drugs and potentially competing drugs. Our competitors are developing or may be attempting to develop therapeutics for our target indications.





17







Factors affecting competition in these markets include the financial, research and development, testing, and marketing strengths of individual competitors, trends in industry consolidation, consumers’ product options, product quality, price, technology, reputation, customer service capabilities and access to market partners and customers. Eliquis is manufactured and distributed by Bristol Myers Squibb, amiodarone is manufactured and distributed by several companies, including Sanofi, Baxter, and Pfizer, Pradaxa is manufactured and distributed by Boehringer Ingelheim, Xarelto is manufactured and distributed by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, and Savaysa is manufactured and distributed by Daiichi Sankyo. Each of these organizations has a long operating history, extensive resources, strong brand recognition and large customer base. As a result, we expect they will be able to devote greater resources than we can to the manufacture, promotion and sale of their products, receive greater resources and support than we will from market partners and independent distributors, initiate and withstand substantial price competition, and take advantage more readily than we could of acquisition and other strategic market opportunities. In addition, these or other organizations could succeed in developing new products that perform better or more cost-effectively than our products and product candidates in their respective markets. Moreover, changes in health trends, diet or other factors could substantially reduce the commercial attractiveness or viability of anti-anginal, anticoagulant, anti-arrhythmic and anti-platelet products.



The high level of competition in these markets could result in pricing pressure, reduced margins, the inability of our product candidates to achieve market acceptance and other impediments to commercial success. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the development of competitive products and commercialize them on a competitive basis.



Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.



Intellectual Property



Our success will significantly depend upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our drug candidates, including market and data exclusivity granted by regulatory agencies and composition-of-matter, dosage and formulation patents, as well as patent and other intellectual property and proprietary protection for our novel biological discoveries and other important technology inventions and know-how. In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”



We have two issued U.S. patents directed to tecarfarin. The expiration dates of the patents are 2024 for both our composition of matter patent and our method of treatment patent, not including any possible patent term extension. Foreign patents corresponding to the tecarfarin patents expire in 2025. If our patents expire, we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, and competitors may be able to erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.



However, in the U.S., the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. Provisions are available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug or to provide data exclusivity. For example, data exclusivity in the EU may be available for 10 years from approval and in Japan for eight years from approval. It is possible that issued U.S. patents covering tecarfarin may be entitled to patent term extensions. If our product candidates receive FDA approval, we intend to apply for patent term extensions, if available, to extend the term of patents that cover the approved product candidates. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.

Data Exclusivity



If tecarfarin is approved by the FDA, we expect to receive five years of data exclusivity, often referred to as new chemical entity exclusivity, for our tecarfarin NDA, so long as FDA has not approved a drug containing the same active moiety as tecarfarin. It is possible that the FDA may disagree with our position and not approve tecarfarin or grant new chemical exclusivity to our NDA for tecarfarin. Assuming the FDA approves tecarfarin and new chemical entity exclusivity is granted, during the five-year period, no generic applicant can file an abbreviated drug application referencing our NDA for tecarfarin, unless the generic applicant challenges a patent listed in the FDA Orange Book for the referenced NDA, in which case the generic applicant can file after four years. If the patent is asserted against the generic applicant within 45 days of receipt of a required notice letter by the generic applicant, the generic abbreviated drug application cannot be approved by FDA for up to thirty months.
Government Regulation



The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.



Product development and marketing activities are subject to extensive regulation by various government authorities, including the FDA, other federal, state and local agencies and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, which regulate the design, research, clinical and non-clinical development, testing, manufacturing, storage, distribution, import, export, labeling, advertising and marketing of pharmaceutical products and devices. Generally, before a new drug can be sold, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. The data are often generated in two distinct development states: pre-clinical and clinical.



Among other matters, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, which are collectively referred to as Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase in time. We plan to engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.

Development of Drugs in the United States



Pharmaceutical products must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States. Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.



The pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism trials that support subsequent clinical testing. These pre-clinical laboratory and animal tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including the FDA’s good laboratory practices regulations. A drug’s sponsor must submit the result of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol to the FDA as part of an IND application. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.



Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including good clinical practices, or GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (ii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.



Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval can generally be divided into three sequential phases that may overlap, Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. In Phase 1, generally, small numbers of healthy volunteers are initially exposed to single escalating doses and then multiple escalating doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action and general safety of the drug. Phase 2 trials typically involve trials in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits, common short-term side effects and risks. Phase 2 trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred patients. Phase 3 trials are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 trials usually include from several hundred to several thousand patients and are closely controlled and monitored. In many cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in some instances. In addition to these Phase 1-3 trials, other trials may be conducted to gather additional safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information. Pharmaceutical products with active ingredients that are the same as or similar to those already approved by the FDA may have more streamlined development programs than new chemical entities.



The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and reporting of study progress and any adverse experiences is required. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, responsible for overseeing trials at particular sites and protecting human research trial patients. An independent institutional review



board may also suspend or terminate a trial once initiated, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND, will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.



Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. Sometimes, these trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic condition. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. In other situations, post-approval trials aim to gain additional indications for a medication.





21







Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.



Review and Approval in the United States



Following Phase 3 trial completion, data are analyzed to determine safety and efficacy, with any final such determination to be made by the FDA. Data are then submitted to the FDA in an NDA, along with proposed labeling for the product and information about the manufacturing and testing processes and facilities that will be used to ensure product quality. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Manufacturers may be assessed up to five program fees for a fiscal year for prescription drug products identified in a single approved NDA. These fees are typically increased annually. In the United States, FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before marketing a new drug.



The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within 10 to 12 months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.



The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee — typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts — for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of advisory committees, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured.



The FDA may conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with current good manufacturing practice requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMPs, is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.



After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information included.



An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.



Pediatric Information



Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.





22







The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity — patent or non-patent — for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA’s written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant’s agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.



Orphan Drug Designation



Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. It also does not suggest FDA approval or exclusivity. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding of up to $500,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.



Orphan drug exclusivity means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug’s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant’s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. There has been recent litigation concerning FDA’s interpretation of the orphan drug exclusivity provisions.



Accelerated Approval



There are a variety of pathways under which applicants may seek expedited approval from FDA, including Fast Track, breakthrough therapy, priority review and accelerated approval. Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of investigational drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Drugs that receive Fast Track designation may be eligible for more frequent communications and meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug’s development plan, including the design of the proposed clinical trials, use of biomarkers and the extent of data needed to support approval. Drugs with Fast Track designation may also qualify for accelerated approval and priority review of new drug applications if relevant criteria are met. However, Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.



The FDA accelerated approval program provides for early approval of drugs based on a drug on a clinical trial(s) showing that the drug meets a surrogate or an intermediate clinical endpoint rather than a clinical benefit endpoint. Accelerated approval is possible for drugs for serious conditions that fill an unmet medical need. Under priority review, the FDA reviews an application in six months rather than ten months after it is accepted for filing.



A surrogate endpoint used for accelerated approval is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Likewise, an intermediate clinical endpoint is a measure of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on irreversible morbidity and mortality. Because it sometimes can take many years for a drug trial to show a clinical benefit, the use of a surrogate endpoint or an intermediate clinical endpoint can significantly shorten the time required to complete clinical trials and obtain FDA approval.



If a drug receives an accelerated approval, the company that sponsored the application must conduct a post-approval trial to confirm the anticipated clinical benefit. These trials are known as Phase 4 or post-approval confirmatory trials. If the confirmatory trial shows that the drug actually provides a clinical benefit, then the FDA grants traditional approval for the drug. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. If the confirmatory trial does not show that the drug provides clinical benefit, FDA has regulatory procedures in place that could lead to removing the drug from the market.

Drug Development in Europe



In the European Union, our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. Similar to the United States, the marketing of medicinal products is subject to the granting of marketing authorizations by regulatory agencies. Also, as in the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.



Review and Approval in the European Union



In the European Union, approval of new medicinal products can be obtained through one of three processes: the mutual recognition procedure, the centralized procedure and the decentralized procedure. We intend to determine which process we will follow, if any, in the future.



Mutual Recognition Procedure: An applicant submits an application in one European Union member state, known as the reference member state. Once the reference member state has granted the marketing authorization, the applicant may choose to submit applications in other concerned member states, requesting them to mutually recognize the marketing authorizations already granted. Under this mutual recognition process, authorities in other concerned member states have 55 days to raise objections, which must then be resolved by discussion among the concerned member states, the reference member state and the applicant within 90 days of the commencement of the mutual recognition procedure. If any disagreement remains, all considerations by authorities in the concerned member states are suspended and the disagreement is resolved through an arbitration process. The mutual recognition procedure results in separate national marketing authorizations in the reference member state.
Centralized Procedure: This procedure is currently mandatory for products developed by means of a biotechnological process and optional for new active substances and other “innovative medicinal products with novel characteristics.” Under this procedure, an application is submitted to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products. Two European Union member states are appointed to conduct an initial evaluation of each application. These countries each prepare an assessment report that is then used as the basis of a scientific opinion of the Committee on Proprietary Medical Products. If this opinion is favorable, it is sent to the European Commission, which drafts a decision. After consulting with the member states, the European Commission adopts a decision and grants a marketing authorization, which is valid throughout the European Union and confers the same rights and obligations in each of the member states as a marketing authorization granted by that member state.
Decentralized Procedure: The most recently introduced of the three processes for obtaining approval of new medicinal processes in the European Union, the decentralized procedure is similar to the mutual recognition procedure described above, but with differences in the timing that key documents are provided to concerned member states by the reference member state, the overall timing of the procedure and the possibility of, among other things, “clock stops” during the procedure.



Post-Marketing Requirements



Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Modifications or enhancements to the products or labeling or changes of site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. The FDA regulations require the products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices, and NDA holders must list their products and register their manufacturing establishments with the FDA. These regulations also impose certain organizational, procedural and documentation requirements with respect to manufacturing and quality assurance activities. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with current good manufacturing practice and other laws. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms. These firms are subject to inspections by the FDA at any time, and the discovery of violative conditions could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them.

Other Regulatory Matters



Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and state and local governments. These laws and regulations include:

● | The federal healthcare program anti-kickback law which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent. The government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law or related to off-label promotion constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims laws;

● | The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report on an annual basis information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with the information made publicly available on a searchable website; and

● | The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates” — independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities, and still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Nevada require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties.

Distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, traceability, and storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products.

Third-Party Payer Coverage and Reimbursement



Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our drug candidates that ultimately may obtain regulatory approval. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including, in the United States, governmental payers such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payer has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payers often rely on the lead of the governmental payers in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our products can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payers.



The United States Congress and state legislatures may, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our products and product candidates profitably. For example, in the first quarter of 2018, President Trump signed a law requiring pharmaceutical companies to pay for a substantially larger percentage of the coverage gap, or the so-called “donut hole,” between regular and catastrophic Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, a change that is estimated to have a multi-billion-dollar effect on brand-name drug companies. Additional changes could be made in the future to governmental healthcare programs and many other laws that could significantly impact the success of our products.



The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payer interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.



Some third-party payers also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drugs before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such drugs. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our products and product candidates and operate profitably.



In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to be significantly lower.



Trade Laws



Among other matters, U.S. and foreign anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, which are collectively referred to as Trade Laws, prohibit companies and their employees, agents, clinical research organizations, legal counsel, accountants, consultants, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving directly or indirectly, corrupt or improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. Violations of Trade Laws can result in substantial criminal fines and civil penalties, imprisonment, the loss of trade privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We also expect our non-U.S. activities to increase in time. We plan to engage third parties for clinical trials and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals and we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our personnel, agents, or partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have prior knowledge of such activities.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company



We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to other public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:

● | Reduced obligations with respect to financial data, including presenting only two years of audited financial statements and selected financial data, and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations disclosure in our initial registration statement; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements in our periodic reports, registration statements and proxy statements; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | exemptions from the requirements to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may take advantage of some or all of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.235 billion, (iii) the date on which we have, during the immediately preceding three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, or the SEC. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. For example, we have taken advantage of the reduced reporting requirements with respect to disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements, have presented only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure in this prospectus, and have taken advantage of the exemption from auditor attestation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. To the extent that we take advantage of these reduced burdens, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might obtain from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.



In addition, the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our timeline to comply with new or revised accounting standards will in many cases be delayed as compared to other public companies that are not eligible to take advantage of this election or have not made this election. Therefore, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with the public company effective dates for these accounting standards.



We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and have elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. To the extent that we continue to qualify as a “smaller reporting company” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an “emerging growth company” may continue to be available to us as a “smaller reporting company,” including exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements pursuant to SOX and reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. We will continue to be a “smaller reporting company” until we have $250 million or more in public float (based on our Common Stock) measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, in the event we have no public float (based on our Common Stock) or a public float (based on our Common Stock) that is less than $700 million, annual revenues of $100 million or more during the most recently completed fiscal year.
