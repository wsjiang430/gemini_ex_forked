ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General 



Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation (the “Company” or “Greenland”) was incorporated on December 28, 2017 as a British Virgin Islands company with limited liability. The Company was incorporated as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Following the Business Combination (as described and defined below) in October 2019, the Company changed its name from Greenland Acquisition Corporation to Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation.



Greenland serves as the parent company of Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a holding company formed under the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (“Hong Kong”) on April 23, 2009 (“Zhongchai Holding”). Zhongchai Holding’s subsidiaries include Zhejiang Zhongchai Machinery Co. Ltd., an operating company formed under the laws of the PRC in 2005, Hangzhou Greenland Energy Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Hangzhou Greenland”), an operating company formed under the laws of the PRC in 2019, Shanghai Hengyu Business Management Consulting Co., Ltd., a company formed under the laws of the PRC in 2005 (“Shanghai Hengyu”), and Hengyu Capital Limited, a company formed in Hong Kong on August 16, 2022 (“Hengyu Capital”). Through Zhongchai Holding and its subsidiaries, Greenland develops and manufactures traditional transmission products for material handling machineries in the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”).



HEVI Corp. (“HEVI”), formerly known as Greenland Technologies Corp. prior to May 2022, was incorporated on January 14, 2020 under the laws of the State of Delaware. HEVI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Greenland and promotes sales of sustainable alternative products for the heavy industrial equipment industry, including electric industrial vehicles, in the North American market.



Through its PRC subsidiaries, Greenland offers transmission products, which are key components for forklift trucks used in manufacturing and logistic applications, such as factories, workshops, warehouses, fulfilment centers, shipyards, and seaports. Forklifts play an important role in the logistic systems of many companies across different industries in China and globally. Generally, industries with the largest demand for forklifts include the transportation, warehousing logistics, electrical machinery, and automobile industries. Greenland’s revenue decreased from approximately $98.84 million in the fiscal year 2021 to $90.83 million in the fiscal year 2022. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in the Company’s sales volume resulting from COVID-19 related lockdowns in China for the year ended December 31, 2022. Based on our revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we believe that Greenland is one of the major developers and manufacturers of transmission products for small and medium-sized forklift trucks in China.



Greenland’s transmission products are used in 1-ton to 15-tons forklift trucks, some with mechanical shift and some with automatic shift. Greenland sells these transmission products directly to forklift-truck manufacturers. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Greenland sold an aggregate of 129,686 and 141,431 sets of transmission products, respectively, to more than 100 forklift manufacturers in the PRC.



Utilizing Greenland’s expertise in manufacturing and R&D, HEVI exists to create clean and sustainable products and services in the heavy industrial equipment industry that help organizations pursue a carbon neutral operation. HEVI designs, develops, and manufactures electric heavy industrial equipment and accessories and sells them directly to the end consumers in various markets in the United States. HEVI’s product line available for purchase includes the GEL-5000 all-electric lithium 5.0-ton rated load wheeled front loader, GEL-1800 all-electric lithium 1.8-ton rated load wheeled front loader, the GEX-8000 all-electric lithium 8.0-ton rated load excavator, and the GEF-series of electric lithium forklifts. In August 2022, HEVI launched a 54,000 square foot industrial electric vehicle assembly site in Baltimore, Maryland to support local assembly, services and distribution of its product line.



Significant Activities since Inception



Initial Public Offering



On July 27, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 4,400,000 units, including a partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 400,000 units. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, no par value, one warrant to purchase one-half of one ordinary share and one right to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share upon the consummation of our initial business combination, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1. Warrants must be exercised in multiples of two warrants, and each two warrants are exercisable for one ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, which generated $44,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and offering expenses) in gross proceeds.




1







Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 282,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit to Greenland Asset Management Corporation (the “Sponsor”) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”), which generated $2,820,000 in gross proceeds. We also sold to Chardan (and its designees), for $100, an option to purchase up to 240,000 units exercisable at $11.50 per unit (or an aggregate exercise price of $2,760,000) commencing on consummation of the Business Combination (as defined below). The unit purchase option may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and expires on July 24, 2023. On February 18, 2021, Chardan exercised its option to purchase 120,000 units. As of the date of this Report, 120,000 units remain exercisable under the option.



Business Combination 



On October 24, 2019, we consummated our business combination with Zhongchai Holding (the “Business Combination”) after a special meeting, where the shareholders of Greenland considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), dated as of July 12, 2019, among (i) Greenland, (ii) Zhongchai Holding, (iii) the Sponsor, in the capacity as the purchaser representative (the “Purchaser Representative”), and (iv) Cenntro Holding Limited, the sole member of Zhongchai Holding (the “Zhongchai Equity Holder” or the “Seller”).



Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Greenland acquired from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Zhongchai Holding in exchange for 7,500,000 newly issued ordinary shares, no par value of Greenland, to the Seller (the “Exchange Shares”). As a result, the Seller became the controlling shareholder of Greenland, and Zhongchai Holding became a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Greenland. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by the Share Exchange Agreement, where Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.



The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization (the “Recapitalization Transaction”) in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations. For accounting and financial reporting purposes, Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer based on the following facts and circumstances:




● | Zhongchai Holding’s operations comprise the ongoing operations of the combined entity; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The officers of the newly combined company consist of Zhongchai Holding’s executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel; and 
● | The former shareholders of Zhongchai Holding own a majority voting interests in the combined entity. 




As a result of Zhongchai Holding being the accounting acquirer, the financial reports filed with the SEC by the Company subsequent to the Business Combination are prepared “as if” Zhongchai Holding is the predecessor and legal successor to the Company. The historical operations of Zhongchai Holding are deemed to be those of the Company. Thus, the financial statements included in this Report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Zhongchai Holding prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of Zhongchai Holding and Greenland following the Business Combination in October 2019; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Zhongchai Holding at their historical cost, and (iv) Greenland’s equity structure for all periods presented. Zhongchai Holding received 7,500,000 shares of Greenland in exchange for all the share capital, which is reflected retroactively to December 31, 2017 and will be utilized for calculating earnings per share in all prior periods. No step-up basis of intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in the Business Combination transaction, which is consistent with the treatment of the transaction as a reverse recapitalization of Zhongchai Holding. 



Incorporation of HEVI Corp.



On January 14, 2020, HEVI Corp., formerly known as Greenland Technologies Corp. prior to May 2022, was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware.

Products



Greenland provides transmission systems and integrated powertrains for material handling machineries, particularly for electric forklift trucks. In order to expand and diversify existing product offerings, Greenland recently entered into the electric industry vehicles market, by designing and developing electric industry vehicles.



Transmission products for material handling machineries







4







Transmission Systems. For 15 years, Greenland, along with its subsidiaries, specializes in designing, developing, and manufacturing a wide range of transmission systems for material handling machineries, in particular forklift trucks. The range of the transmission systems covers machineries from one ton to fifteen tons. Most transmission systems contain auto transmission features. This feature allows for easy machine operations. In addition, Greenland provides transmission system for internal combustion powered machineries as well as for electrical powered machineries. Greenland has recently experienced an increasing demand for electric powered transmission systems. These transmission systems are key components for material handling machinery assembly. To meet this increasing demand, Greenland is able to providing these transmission systems to major forklift truck original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) as well as certain global branded manufacturers.






Integrated Powertrain. Through its PRC subsidiaries, Greenland designs and develops new and distinctive powertrains, which integrates electric motor, speed reduction gearbox, and driving axles into a combined integral module, in order to meet a growing demand for advanced electric forklift trucks. This integrated powertrain will enable the OEMs to significantly shorten design cycle, improve machinery efficiency, and simplify manufacturing process. There is a new trend that OEMs would rather use an integrated powertrain than separate electric motor, speed reduction gearbox, and driving axles, particularly in electric forklift trucks. Currently, Greenland makes two tons to three and a half-tons integrated powertrains for few electric forklift truck OEMs. Greenland is in the process of adding more integrated powertrain products for electric forklift truck OEMs with different sizes.

Recent Regulatory Developments



We and our PRC subsidiaries are subject to certain legal and operational risks associated with our PRC subsidiaries’ operations in China. PRC laws and regulations governing our PRC subsidiaries’ current business operations are sometimes vague and uncertain, and, as a result, these risks may result in material changes in the operations of our PRC subsidiaries, significant depreciation of the value of our ordinary shares, or a complete hindrance of our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors. For instance, except for fulfilling the filing procedure with the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC, in connection with future offerings, we believe that we and our PRC subsidiaries are currently not required to obtain any permission or approval from the  CSRC and the Cyberspace Administration of China, or the CAC, in the PRC to offer securities to foreign investors.   However, there is no guarantee that this will continue to be the case in the future in relation to a follow-on offering or the continued listing of our securities on a U.S. securities exchange, or even in the event such permission or approval is required and obtained, it will not be subsequently revoked or rescinded. In the event that such approval is required in the future and we and/or our PRC subsidiaries do not receive or maintain such approval, our ordinary shares may significantly decline in value or become worthless, and our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors may be significantly limited or completely hindered.



In addition, we and our PRC subsidiaries are subject to risks and uncertainties of the interpretations and applications of PRC laws and regulations, including but not limited to, limitations on foreign ownership in the industry in which our PRC subsidiaries operate. We and our PRC subsidiaries are also subject to the risks and uncertainties about any future actions of the PRC government. If any future actions of the PRC government result in a material change in our operations, the value of our ordinary shares may depreciate significantly or become worthless. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could adversely affect us and our PRC subsidiaries.”

Recently, the PRC government adopted a series of regulatory actions and issued statements to regulate business operations in China, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. As of the date of this Report, our Company and our PRC subsidiaries have not been involved in any investigations on cybersecurity review initiated by any PRC regulatory authority, nor has any of them received any inquiry, notice or sanction. As of the date of this Report, we and our PRC subsidiaries have not received any inquiry, notice, warning, or sanctions from the CSRC or any other PRC governmental authorities regarding the offering of our securities outside of the PRC.



On February 17, 2023, the CSRC published the Regulations of Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies (the “Trial Measures”) and its accompanying guidelines and instructions, which came into effect on March 31, 2023, and will apply if a domestic enterprise issues shares, depositary receipts, corporate bonds convertible into shares, or other securities of an equity nature outside of the PRC, or lists its securities for trading outside of the PRC. According to such regulations, a domestic enterprise that issues and lists its securities outside of the PRC shall comply with the filing procedures and report the relevant information to the CSRC. A domestic enterprise shall not be listed on an overseas stock exchange if any of the following circumstances exists: (i) where such securities offering and listing is explicitly prohibited by provisions in laws, administrative regulations and relevant state rules; (ii) where the intended securities offering and listing may endanger national security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State Council in accordance with law; (iii) where the domestic company intending to make the securities offering and listing, or its controlling shareholders and the actual controller, have committed crimes such as corruption, bribery, embezzlement, misappropriation of property or undermining the order of the socialist market economy during the latest three years; (iv) where the domestic company intending to make the securities offering and listing is suspected of committing crimes or major violations of laws and regulations, and is under investigation according to law, and no conclusion has yet been made thereof; (v) where there are material ownership disputes over equity held by the domestic company's controlling shareholder or by other shareholders that are controlled by the controlling shareholder and/or actual controller. The Trial Measures changes the management of licensing to record management, strengthen the supervision in the aftermath, create a more transparent and predictable institutional environment, and support the standardized development of enterprises using the overseas capital market. As such, we will be required to complete filing procedures with CSRC in connection with our future offerings. Additionally, we may be prohibited from continued listing if we fit into any of the five scenarios as discussed above. Furthermore, in the event that an approval from Chinese authorities is required for our future offerings or continued listing on Nasdaq, if we and/or our PRC subsidiaries do not receive or maintain required approvals, or we inadvertently conclude that such approvals are not required, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change such that we and/or our PRC subsidiaries are required to obtain approval in the future, we and/or our PRC subsidiaries may be subject to an investigation by Chinese regulators, fines or penalties, or an order prohibiting us from conducting an offering, and these risks could result in a material adverse change in our operations and the value of our ordinary shares, significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors, or cause such securities to significantly decline in value or become worthless. In addition since these statements and regulatory actions are newly published, and official guidance and related implementation rules have not been issued, it is highly uncertain what the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our subsidiaries’ daily business operation, the ability to accept foreign investments and our ability to continue our listing on a U.S. exchange. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — Our PRC subsidiaries may be liable for improper use or appropriation of personal information provided by their customers and any failure to comply with PRC laws and regulations over data security could result in materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and our continued listing on Nasdaq.”



Although we are not currently owned or controlled by a governmental entity in any foreign jurisdiction, the PRC government has exercised, and continues to exercise, substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership, including the steel sector where our PRC subsidiaries have been conducting their business. Any government decisions or actions to change the steel production, or any decisions the government might make to cut spending, could adversely impact our PRC subsidiaries’ business and our results of operations. We believe that our PRC subsidiaries’ operations in China are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of the jurisdictions in which our PRC subsidiaries operate may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations with little advance notice that could require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our and our PRC subsidiaries’ compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Furthermore, the PRC government authorities may continue to strengthen oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers like us. Such actions taken by the PRC government authorities may intervene or influence the operations of our PRC subsidiaries at any time, which may be beyond our control. Therefore, any such action may adversely affect the operations of our PRC subsidiaries and significantly limit or hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to you and reduce the value of such securities or cause the value of such securities to be completely worthless. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — The PRC government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which our PRC subsidiaries must conduct their business activities. If the Chinese government significantly regulates the business operations of our PRC subsidiaries in the future and our PRC subsidiaries are not able to substantially comply with such regulations, the business operations of our PRC subsidiaries may be materially and adversely affected and the value of our ordinary shares may significantly decrease.”



Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCA Act, if Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”) determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor, and that as a result, an exchange may determine to delist our securities. The PCAOB has been able to inspect our auditor, WWC P.C., an independent registered public accounting firm with its headquarters in San Mateo, California, and with its last inspection completed in November 2021. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — A recent joint statement by the SEC and the PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the HFCA Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB.”

Trading in our securities may be prohibited under the HFCA Act if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate our auditor, and that as a result, an exchange may determine to delist our securities. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and on December 29, 2022, a legislation entitled “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023” (the “Consolidated Appropriations Act”) was signed into law by President Biden, which contained, among other things, an identical provision to Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and amended the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act by requiring the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted. The PCAOB has been able to inspect our auditor, WWC P.C., an independent registered public accounting firm with its headquarters in San Mateo, California, with its last inspection conducted in November 2021. On December 16, 2021, the PCAOB issued a report to notify the SEC of its determinations that it is unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in Mainland China and Hong Kong, respectively, and identifies the registered public accounting firms in Mainland China and Hong Kong that are subject to such determinations. Our auditor is not subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. On August 26, 2022, the CSRC, the Ministry of Finance (the “MOF”), and the PCAOB signed the Protocol, governing inspections and investigations of audit firms based in China and Hong Kong. The Protocol remains unpublished and is subject to further explanation and implementation. Pursuant to the fact sheet with respect to the Protocol disclosed by the SEC, the PCAOB shall have independent discretion to select any issuer audits for inspection or investigation and has the unfettered ability to transfer information to the SEC. On December 15, 2022, the PCAOB Board determined that the PCAOB was able to secure complete access to inspect and investigate registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong and voted to vacate its previous determinations to the contrary. However, should PRC authorities obstruct or otherwise fail to facilitate the PCAOB’s access in the future, the PCAOB Board will consider the need to issue a new determination. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — A recent joint statement by the SEC and the PCAOB, proposed rule changes submitted by Nasdaq, and the HFCA Act all call for additional and more stringent criteria to be applied to emerging market companies upon assessing the qualification of their auditors, especially the non-U.S. auditors who are not inspected by the PCAOB.”



Dividend Policy and Cash Transfers



We intend to retain all of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As such, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and only if we satisfy the applicable government registration and approval requirements.



Our PRC subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends only out of their retained earnings. However, each of our PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, after making up for previous year’s accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory reserves, until the aggregate amount of such funds reaches 50% of registered capital. This portion of our PRC subsidiaries’ respective net assets are prohibited from being distributed to their shareholders as dividends. However, none of our PRC subsidiaries has made any dividends or distributions to our holding company or any U.S. investors as of the date of this Report. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — We may rely on dividends paid by our subsidiaries for our cash needs, and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business.”



In addition, the PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.”



A 10% PRC withholding tax is applicable to dividends payable to investors that are non-resident enterprises. Any gain realized on the transfer of ordinary shares by such investors is also subject to PRC tax at a current rate of 10%, which in case of dividends will be withheld at source if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within the PRC. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Doing Business in China — Under the PRC EIT Law, we may be classified as a ‘Resident Enterprise’ of China. Any classification as such will likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.”



We have adopted written cash management policies and procedures that dictate how funds are transferred within our organization. According to such policies and procedures, each subsidiary of the Company may initiate a cash transfer request by timely filling out a fund application form, which shall be signed by the financial principal and the principal of the subsidiary and then submitted to the financial department of the Company for approval. After a cash transfer request is approved by the financial department, the relevant subsidiary may proceed to initiate such transfer. Our Company distributed cash as loans to our subsidiaries. Several cash transfers have been made between our Company and our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, our Company had provided loans in the amount of $4,286,589 to Zhongchai Holding.

Competitive Strengths



Greenland believes that it is in the right position and the right time to supply a new generation of industrial heavy equipment, including electric industrial vehicles, that is green, safe, and cost-effective. The following is a summary of Greenland’s competitive strengths.
Favorable Market Trends



Greenland believes that a number of key industry trends in the PRC will continue to benefit Greenland and its subsidiaries and continue to drive its growth, including:

● | increasingly stringent regulations over carbon emission, which urge market participants to adopt low or zero-emission material handling and construction equipment; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | increasing demand for a safer work environment and better healthy worker’s condition will drive growth of electric material handling equipment or industry vehicle, which generates no exhausts and a low level of noise in operation; 
● | increasing labor cost, which accelerates labor substitution with machinery in material handling and logistic activities; 
● | strong competitiveness of U.S. branded products in the U.S., in which the next generation of electric industrial vehicles will be assembled and sold; 
● | increasing government support for improving efficiency in the PRC’s logistics industry, which is a key market for material handling machinery such as forklifts and loaders; and 
● | increasing government support for logistic mechanization, including in the form of subsidies. 




As a result of these favorable industry trends, Greenland believes that it is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing market demand for transmission products in the PRC as well as on the growing demand for emission-free and labor substitution by electric vehicles in the United States.

Customers



Greenland, through its subsidiaries, sells most of its transmission products in the PRC and electric industrial heavy equipment in the U.S. Its customer bases are primarily in the businesses of material handling equipment and forklift trucks. Greenland believes that its customers include some of the leading manufacturers in their respective market segments. Greenland also supplies to the PRC subsidiaries of a number of blue-chip international brands based in Europe and Asia.



During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Greenland’s five largest customers contributed 50.85% and 54.06%, respectively, of its total revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Greenland’s single largest customer, Hangcha Group, accounted for 17.14% and 18.47%, respectively, of Greenland’s total revenue, and Greenland’s second largest customer, Longgong Forklift Truck, accounted for 14.14% and 14.94%, respectively, of Greenland’s total revenue.



Suppliers



Greenland purchases its raw materials from various suppliers for use in the manufacture of its products.



The key raw materials used to manufacture its products are processed metal-based parts and components, including iron castings and gears, which are purchased from our domestic suppliers in the PRC. Most of our suppliers are located within close proximity to our manufacturing facilities, which reduces our transportation and inventory costs.



The prices for iron and steel and other raw materials have historically fluctuated significantly in the PRC, which in turn has affected the Company’s business and operation results. Greenland closely monitors changes in raw material prices and seeks to adjust its inventory of raw materials during inflation periods. In addition, Greenland seeks to minimize the impact of fluctuations in raw material prices by adopting bidding processes in its raw material procurement process Greenland also seeks to price its products to reflect the expected fluctuations in raw material prices to the extent possible. However, there can be no assurance that Greenland could precisely estimate any increase in raw material price or pass on such increase to its customers.

HEVI purchases components, electronics, battery systems and metal-based parts for use in the assembly of its electric industrial heavy equipment from various suppliers based in the PRC. These items are transported to the United States for assembly of the final products.



HEVI seeks to price its products to reflect expected increases in the component prices and transportation costs to the extent possible. However, there can be no assurance that HEVI could precisely estimate any increase in components or pass on such increase to its customers.



Production



Greenland’s transmission products are comprised of a number of major parts and components, including gearbox housing, gears, bearings, oil pumps, gear shafts, hydraulics, electric forklifts, wheeled excavators, and electrical components. The gearbox housing and gears parts are processed in-house at its manufacturing facility in Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, the PRC. Components of such products, in general, are sourced, from third parties, assembled, and integrated to form finished products. The finished products then undergo further adjustments, fine tunings, testing, and quality inspections. At the end of the inspection process and prior to shipment to our warehouses for storage and distribution, the finished products are coated and painted.



Greenland’s electric industrial heavy equipment is manufactured and assembled in its 54,000 square foot industrial electric vehicle assembly site in Baltimore, Maryland.



Inventory and Warehousing



Greenland undertakes inventory control in order to reduce the risks of under and over-stocking. On average, Greenland typically maintains a 30 days stock piles for production needs. It generally increases its inventories toward the end of the year in order to meet any production demand, in anticipation of any demands increase, from the second quarter of the following year. Furthermore, Greenland maintains higher inventories at year-end because Chinese New Year typically falls in January or February, which affects production and transportation of raw materials. Greenland has installed an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, which provides real-time information about purchases, production schedules, and supplies of the raw materials. The ERP system has substantially improved Greenland’s inventory controls, providing the Company with quick access to various data and easy formulation of operating models, and allowing the Company to keep its inventory at an appropriable level to facilitate the manufacturing process.
Research and Development



Greenland’s research and development team selects research or development projects or both and draws up preliminary project proposals based on various factors, such as industry and market trends, customer feedback, and input from other departments (i.e. finance and manufacturing departments).



Greenland’s management, including the heads and lead managers of various internal departments, such as sales and marketing and finance departments, as well as its chief executive officer and chief technology officer, reviews the preliminary project proposals and its research and development team formulates a final plan for each approved project after considering suggestions and comments by its management. The final plans will include detailed schedules and budgets for the projects. Greenland’s finance department monitors budget overruns. Any increase in the original budget must be reviewed and approved by management before the relevant project can continue.



Greenland has also focused on research and development with respect to its electric industrial equipment and related products. Greenland’s electric industrial heavy equipment products currently include GEF-series electric forklifts, a series of lithium powered forklifts with three models ranging in size from 1.8 tons to 3.5 tons, and GEL-1800, a 1.8 ton rated load lithium powered electric wheeled front loader and GEX-8000, an all-electric 8.0 ton rated load lithium powered wheeled excavator. These products have become available for purchase in the U.S. market.



Greenland, through HEVI, continues to focus its research and development efforts on its next generation of electric industrial heavy equipment along with supporting products such as mobile charging units and attachments that will increase the value of its portfolio.

Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property



Greenland relies on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, software registration, and trade secret laws to protect its intellectual property rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third parties to infringe our Company’s intellectual property rights.
Patents



As of December 31, 2022, Greenland held 104 registered patents with the PRC National Intellectual Property Administration (“CNIPA”), 91 of which are utility patents and 13 of which are invention patents. These patents relate to the manufacturing of products.



As of December 31, 2022, Greenland had been granted two trademarks registered with the CNIPA.



Greenland’s intellectual property also includes technical data such as test results and operating data from projects, drawings, designs, and machinery and manufacturing techniques it developed in-house.



Sales and Marketing



Greenland sells its products in PRC through its sales and marketing teams. To promote Greenland’s brand, sales employees also attend trade shows and exhibitions to showcase our products.



As of December 31, 2022, Greenland’s sales and marketing team consisted of 16 employees. Members of its sales and marketing teams have extensive experience and knowledge in the material handling equipment sector of the manufacturing industry. They are primarily responsible for identifying business opportunities, promoting products, collecting customer feedbacks and market information, bidding for or negotiating orders, and collecting payments.



Competition



Transmission Industry



The transmission industry is fragmented and highly competitive in the PRC. Under the current market trend, domestically produced transmissions account for the largest share of the PRC market. International brand manufacturers equipped with better technology and capital resources are also aiming to expand into the PRC. As a result, it is expected that the PRC transmission market will become more competitive.



The typical competitive criteria are quality, price, technology, after-sales service, product offering, and performance record. The transmissions market is capital intensive. In addition, the manufacturing process requires technical expertise and significant research and development budgets. As a result, companies entering the market must have significant financial and technical resources. Moreover, the time and cost required to establish a proven track record, necessary for general market acceptance, are substantial. An extensive after-sales service network is essential for a company to gain general market acceptance.



Greenland believes that it is able to compete based on its market position, strong research and development capabilities, high quality products, integrated service systems, and strong relationships with its customers.



Our key competitors are Shaoxing Advance Gearbox Co., Ltd., Changsha Zhongchuan Transmission Machinery Co. Ltd., and Ganzhou Wuhuan Machine Co., Ltd.

Electric Industrial Heavy Equipment Industry



Greenland entered the electric industrial heavy equipment industry in January 2020. With our strategic supply chain partners, we have leveraged our robust research and development capabilities, as well as our industry and market experience to develop a new product line of electric industrial heavy equipment. Greenland’s electric industrial heavy equipment products currently include GEF-series electric forklifts, a series of lithium powered forklifts with three models ranging in size from 1.8 tons to 3.5 tons, GEL-1800, a 1.8 ton rated load lithium powered electric wheeled front loader and GEX-8000, an all-electric 8.0 ton rated load lithium powered wheeled excavator. These products have become available for purchase in the U.S. market. In August 2022, HEVL launched a 54,000 square foot industrial electric vehicle assembly site in Baltimore, Maryland to support local services, assembly and distribution of its electric industrial heavy equipment product line. 
Fast Growing Market. The global construction equipment market is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 3.9% from 2020 to 2025, reaching US$205 billion, according to a November 2020 report published by MarketsandMarkets. The North American market is projected to exhibit one of the fastest growth rates during the forecast period. Consequently, we believe this growth will increase with the introduction of the United State infrastructure overhaul program. Should the program be implemented, then it will be a powerful driver of growth in the engineering and construction industry that will proliferate the demand for industrial equipment.



Call for Carbon Emission Reduction. Global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas and carbon emissions continue to grow with proposals such as the current U.S. administration seeking a target of net zero emission by 2050. These strategies will result in government and public support for the adoption of emission zero technologies and equipment across industries thus boosting the demand for eco-friendly electric powered industrial heavy equipment. As such, we expect that the demand for electric industrial heavy equipment will increase rapidly.



Highly Fragmented and Emerging Market. The electric industrial heavy equipment market is highly fragmented with few, if any, dominant local market participants. Although a few conventional industrial heavy equipment and construction equipment makers are in the process of electric products development, a majority are years away from product deployment. This is to avoid cannibalization with the mature fossil fuel-powered equipment product lines which results in the lack of incentive to launch the full-electric industrial heavy equipment at the near term. As a result, with the early mover advantage together with Greenland’s strong research and development capability, we believe that Greenland is well-positioned to secure a meaningful role in the electric industrial heavy equipment market.



High Technology Barriers for New Entrants. To compete in the electric industrial heavy equipment market, enterprises need a high-level of core technologies and capabilities in order to successfully develop a commercial product. The investment and expertise required create a high barrier of entry for new market players. Greenland’s success in the material handling industry and its achievements in research and development milestones gives Greenland the opportunity and the competitive edge to successfully compete in the industrial heavy equipment market.



Distribution Barriers for Market Leaders. Traditional OEMs in the industrial heavy equipment industry sell through established dealership models which have been proven to be difficult to adapt to electric alternatives. These dealerships rely heavily on service/maintenance revenue. As electric products require over 40% less of maintenance costs, it is challenging for OEMs to motivate their dealers to promote and service the new technology. Without a dealer network to cater to, we believe Greenland is well-positioned to establish a meaningful role in the electric industrial heavy equipment market.



Our key competitors in the industrial heavy equipment industry are the traditional diesel-powered industrial heavy equipment manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Volvo CE and John Deere.

Regulations of Trial Administrative Measures of Overseas Securities Offering and Listing by Domestic Companies 



On February 17, 2023, the CSRC published the Trial Measures and its accompanying guidelines and instructions, which came into effect on March 31, 2023, and will apply if a domestic enterprise issues shares, depositary receipts, corporate bonds convertible into shares, or other securities of an equity nature outside of the PRC, or lists its securities for trading outside of the PRC. According to such regulations, a domestic enterprise that issues and lists its securities outside of the PRC shall comply with the filing procedures and report the relevant information to the CSRC. Where a domestic company fails to fulfill filing procedure, offers and lists securities in an overseas market in violation of the Trial Measures, or the filing documents contain misrepresentation, misleading statement or material omission, the CSRC shall order rectification, issue warning to such domestic company, and impose a fine.



Under the PRC EIT Law, enterprises are classified as either “resident enterprises” or “non-resident enterprises.” Pursuant to PRC EIT Law and its implementation rules, besides enterprises established within the PRC, enterprises established outside PRC whose “de facto management bodies” are located in PRC are considered “resident enterprises” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate for their global income. According to the implementation rules of the PRC EIT Law, “de facto management body” refers to a managing body that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the manufacture and business, personnel, accounting and assets of an enterprise.



Withholding Tax



The PRC EIT Law removes the prior tax exemption and imposes a 10% withholding tax on dividends paid by foreign-invested enterprises to foreign investors. However, for foreign investors whose home countries or regions have signed bilateral tax agreements with PRC, the withholding tax rate may be reduced to as low as 5% depending on the terms of the applicable tax treaty. In accordance with the Arrangement between Mainland PRC and Hong Kong for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income signed on August 21, 2006, the 5% withholding tax rate applies to dividends paid by a PRC company to a Hong Kong tax resident, provided that the recipient is a company that holds directly at least 25% of the interest of the PRC company, otherwise, the applicable withholding tax rate should be 10%. Further, pursuant to the Notice on the Issues concerning the Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements issued by the SAT on February 20, 2009, the preferential tax rate under the relevant tax treaties shall only apply to a tax resident from the other side that directly holds at least 25% of the interest of a PRC company for a period of consecutive 12 months prior to receiving the dividends.

U.S. Laws and Regulations



Battery Safety and Testing



Our battery packs of electric industrial heavy equipment will be subject to various U.S. regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” defined to include lithium batteries, which may present a risk in transportation. We expect to use lithium battery packs in our electric industrial heavy equipment. The use, storage and disposal of our battery packs are regulated under existing laws and are the subject of ongoing regulatory changes that may add additional requirements in the future.
Product Liability Law



U.S. state law generally imposes liability on all manufacturers and retailers (and parties in the supply chain) for injuries that result from unsafe, defective and dangerous products sold to consumers. Product liability claims in the United States are typically based on three theories of law: (1) strict liability, (2) negligence and (3) breach of warranty. In addition, as noted above, U.S. laws and regulations can also obligate manufacturers and retailers (and parties in the supply chain) to remedy product defects, which can include safety recall campaigns.



Parties involved in manufacturing, distributing or selling a product may be subject to liability for harm caused by a defect in that product. There are three types of product defects, namely, design defects, manufacturing defects and defects in marketing. In a negligence claim, a defendant may be held liable for personal injury or property damage caused by the failure to use due care. Strict liability claims, however, do not depend on the degree of carefulness by the defendant. A defendant is liable when it is shown that an injury (personal or to property) occurred as the result of a product’s defect. Breach of warranty is also a form of strict liability in the sense that a showing of fault is not required. The plaintiff need only establish the warranty was breached, regardless of how that came about. Companies that manufacture, distribute or sell a product in a particular state may be subject to the jurisdiction of such state’s product liability laws, whether the company’s jurisdiction of incorporation or principal place of business is in that state, in another U.S. state or in a non-U.S. jurisdiction.



Product liability legal actions and recall campaigns in the United States (“Product Liability Matters”) could involve personal injury and property damage and could involve claims for substantial monetary damages. The results of any future litigation and claims involving product liability in the United States are inherently unpredictable.



Employment and Labor Law



Private businesses operating in the United States are subject to employment laws of the federal governments, state government, and, to a lesser extent, local counties or municipalities. These laws govern many aspects of the workplace as set forth herein and failure to comply can result in fines and penalties from relevant oversight agencies and liability to employees, which can include a multiple of actual damages, counsel fees, and punitive damages for certain violations.



Businesses that operate in New Jersey must comply with governing federal laws and New Jersey State laws (together, “US-NJ Employment Laws”). The default rule in New Jersey is that, in the absence of a labor agreement or contract for employment for a specified term, employment is terminable at will. Employers have a right to discharge an employee at any time, for any reason, or for no reason, provided the termination is not for a reason prohibited by law.



Broadly, our obligation to comply with applicable US-NJ Employment Laws, includes laws and rules relating to:




(i) | Wage and hour standards, such as paying required overtime for employees who do not meet exemption requirements and work in excess of 40 hours in a week, paying minimum wage, and paying wages when due; 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Providing leave and leave benefits to eligible employees, including requirements that unpaid family leave and unpaid leave for reasons including domestic violence or sexual assault shall be provided by covered employers; 
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Non-discrimination and anti-retaliation;

(iv) | Providing reasonable accommodations to and engaging in the interactive process with employees with disabilities, religious needs, or other protected characteristics;

(vi) | Occupational safety.

Failure to comply with the US-NJ Employment Laws may, in some instances, expose us to civil liability to employees or former employees for compensatory damages, statutory damages, as well as punitive damages and counsel fees. We could also be subject to fines, penalties, and assessments from various regulatory authorities.
