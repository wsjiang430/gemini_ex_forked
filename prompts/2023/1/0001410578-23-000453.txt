Item 1. Our Business
Overview
Trust Stamp was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on April 11, 2016 as “T Stamp Inc.” T Stamp Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Trust Stamp”, “we”, or the “Company”) develop and market identity authentication software for enterprise and government partners and peer-to-peer markets. 
Trust Stamp develops proprietary artificial intelligence-powered identity and trust solutions at the intersection of biometrics, privacy, and cybersecurity, that enable organizations to protect themselves and their users, while empowering individuals to retain ownership of their identity data and prevent fraudulent activity using their identity.
Trust Stamp tackles industry challenges including data protection, regulatory compliance, and financial accessibility, with cutting edge technology including biometric science, cryptography, and machine learning. Our core technology irreversibly transforms identity information to create tokenized identifiers that enable accurate authentication without the need to store or share sensitive data. By retaining the usefulness of biometric-derived data while minimizing the risk, we allow businesses to adopt biometrics and other anti-fraud initiatives while protecting personal information from hacks and leaks.
Trust Stamp’s key sub-markets are identity authentication for the purpose of account opening, access and fraud detection, the creation of tokenized digital identities to facilitate financial and societal inclusion, and in-community case management software for alternatives to detention and other governmental uses.
As biometric solutions proliferate, so does the need to protect biometric data. Stored biometric images and templates represent a growing and unquantified financial, security and PR liability and are the subject of governmental, media and public scrutiny, since biometric data cannot be “changed” once they are hacked, as they are directly linked to the user’s physical features and/or behaviors. Privacy concerns around biometric technology have led to close attention from regulators, with multiple jurisdictions placing biometrics in a special or sensitive category of personal data and demanding much stronger safeguards around collection and safekeeping.
To address this unprecedented danger and increased cross-industry need to establish trust quickly and securely in virtual environments, Trust Stamp has developed its Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token, or IT2TM, solutions, which replace biometric templates with a cryptographic hash that can never be rebuilt into the original data and cannot be used to identify the subject outside the environment for which it is designed.
Trust Stamp’s data transformation and comparison technology is vendor and modality agnostic, allowing organizations including other biometric services providers to benefit from the increased protection, efficiency, and utility of our proprietary tokenization process. With online and offline functionality, Trust Stamp technology is effective in even the most remote locations in the world.
Trust Stamp also offers end-to-end solutions for multi-factor biometric authentication for account access and recovery, KYC/AML compliance, customer onboarding, and more, which allow organizations to approve more genuine users, keep bad actors from accessing systems and services, and retain existing users with a superior user experience.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trust Stamp’s biometric authentication, liveness detection, and information tokenization enable individuals to verify and establish their identities using biometrics. While individuals in this market lack traditional means of identity verification, Trust Stamp provides a means to authenticate identity that preserves an individual’s privacy and control over that identity.
Alternatives to Detention (“ATD”)

● | The ATD market includes Federal, State and Municipal agencies for both criminal justice and immigration purposes and there is an accelerating interest in technology-based solutions that the Company is able to offer.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amongst the use cases, a large and growing market is for the provision of alternatives to detention for immigrants that are awaiting a final disposition of their processing. Addressing the House Appropriations Subcommittee for Homeland Security on May 17, 2022, ICE Acting Director stated that the financial year 2023 Budget submitted by ICE for approval included an additional $75,000,000 for the Alternatives to Detention (“ATD”) program over and above the present appropriation and that ICE is “focusing on ATD” instead of more expensive physical detention programs; both because of the threat of COVID and because ATD is less expensive and more humane. On that same day, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee shared that 230,000 participants were then in the ICE ATD program with a planned increase to 600,000 participants.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trust Stamp addresses the ATD market with an application built on Trust Stamp’s privacy-preserving biometrics. Trust Stamp provides hardware and software that provides for the ethical and human tracking of individuals to comply with ATD requirements.
Trust Stamp’s key sub-markets are:

i) | Identity authentication for the purpose of account opening, access and fraud detection;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii) | The creation of tokenized digital identities to facilitate financial and societal inclusion; and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6




iii) | In-community case-management services for governmental agencies.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to its key sub-markets, the Company is developing products and working with partners and industry organizations in other sectors that offer significant market opportunities, in particular, the travel, healthcare, Metaverse platform and cryptographic key and account credential safekeeping sectors. For example, the Company has developed a “crypto key vault” solution that leverages proven facial biometric authentication and irreversible data transformation technology to protect private keys for digital assets while ensuring long-term data protection and access credential availability.
Principal Products and Services
Trust Stamp’s most important technology is the Irreversibly Transformed Identity TokenTM (also known as the IT2TM, Evergreen HashTM, EgHashTM and MyHashTM) combined with a data architecture that can use one or multiple sources of biometric or other identifying data. Once a “hash translation” algorithm is created, like-modality hashes are comparable regardless of their origin. The IT2 protects against system and data redundancy, providing a lifelong “digital-DNA” that can store (or pivot to) any type of KYC or relationship data with fields individually hashed or (salted and) encrypted, facilitating selective data sharing. Products utilizing the IT2 are Trust Stamp’s primary products, accounting for the majority of its revenues during the year ended December 31, 2022.
We adhere to the best practices outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) frameworks, and our policies and procedures in managing personally identifiable information (“PII”) are in compliance with General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) requirements.
IT2 Solutions
The IT2 (for Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token) replaces biometric templates and scans with meaningless numbers, letters, and symbols in order to remove sensitive data from the reach of criminals using a proprietary process by which a deep neural network irreversibly converts biometric and other identifying data, from any source, into the secure tokenized identity. This IT2 is unique to the user, is different every time it is generated from a live subject and cannot be reverse engineered and rebuilt into the user’s face or other original identity data.

Each token can be stored and compared to all other tokens from the same modality, allowing the Company’s AI-powered analytics to predict if a single subject has generated two or more tokens, even if the subject has passed conventional KYC with, e.g., falsified identity 

7



documents. Using this technology, an IT2 can be employed for re-authentication purposes, including account recovery, password-less login, new account creation, and more, across the organization or even within a consortium of organizations, all in a low cost and low friction delivery that is fast and secure.
Our technology is being used for enhanced due diligence, KYC/AML compliance, synthetic identity fraud reduction and “second chance” approval for customer onboarding and account access, together with the delivery of humanitarian and development services. The solution allows organizations to approve more users, keep bad actors from accessing systems and services, and retain existing users with a superior user experience.

Our hashing and matching technology can maximize the effectiveness of all types of identity data, while rendering it safer to use, store, and share. Whatever the source of identity data, it can be stored and compared as an IT2. See the chart below for examples.

Distribution
Through licensing we allow customers to utilize our technology in a wide variety of applications. Uses can include (e.g.):

o | The provision of hashing / services to enterprises, NGOs, and government, to overlay on third-party biometric and identity data
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Hash licensing, translation, and certification services for biometric vendors
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Management of zero-knowledge-proof services, whether as a tributary between Identity Lakes or operating consortium lakes
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Tokenized identity creation for large scale deployments, such as humanitarian and government identity programs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trust Stamp enters into licensing and SaaS agreements. 

8



License agreements are typically as a hosted offering, on-premise solution, or both, with its customers, pursuant to which the customer pays for the initial product development plus a license fee for the use of Trust Stamp’s technologies on a periodic and/or volume-based basis. In addition to consuming and paying for Trust Stamp’s services for their own use, some key customers also serve as channel partners by offering Trust Stamp products to their own customer base, whether as stand-alone products, or integrated into their own services as upgraded product offerings.
SaaS agreements are typically serviced through the Company’s Orchestration Layer platform, which is being utilized in FIS’ new global identity authentication system. The platform includes our proprietary tokenization technology, and is designed to provide easy integration with, and access to, Trust Stamp’s products, chargeable on a per use basis. The Orchestration Layer facilitates no-code and low-code implementations, making adoption faster and even more cost-effective for a broader range of potential customers. It is expected to accelerate the Company’s evolution, from being exclusively a custom solutions provider, to also offering a modular and highly scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with low-code implementation. 
Competition
We can work with any identity data from any source, potentially breaking vendor and modality lock-in, but our primary market target is the biometric service industry, which is growing exponentially while being threatened by a consumer, media, and legislative backlash against storing biometric data. The IT2 can potentially be overlaid on any biometric or other identity data provider.
In general, we compete for customer budget with any company in the identity authentication industry, and our business plan calls for our capturing a fraction of one percent (1%) of the projected expenditure for biometric authentication services. Major competitors in this space include companies such as NEXT Biometrics, IDEMIA, Synaptics, Cognitec, Innovatrics, Suprema, FaceTec, Rank One Computing, Acuant, Jumio, Onfido and Mitek. However, we believe that, due to the uniqueness of our technology solution, the Company does not currently have any direct competitors for the core IT2 solutions upon which the growth in our business plan is focused.
The commercial advantage of our solution is our ability to work across providers and modalities and we continue to pursue a first-mover advantage including our global –scale partnership which is achieving a network effect in the global Humanitarian and Development market. We believe that this combination will make it unattractive for a potential competitor to replicate the 6-years and multi-million dollars, that we have already expended, to try and circumvent our multiple (and continuing) patent filings and/or offer a parallel product based upon a different technology.
We believe that given sufficient time and resources, we can augment any biometric modalities including face, hand, iris, voice, gait, and behavior, together with any other identifying data which places us in a unique position versus providers of biometric services.
We are unaware of any other provider being able to offer or support a proliferation of authentication modalities in this fashion, and therefore we believe there are no other companies that directly compete with us in this space. If our go-to-market strategy is successful, biometric service providers can be a channel distributer, and not necessarily a competitor.
Growth Strategy
Our business plan calls for our capturing a small fraction of one percent (1%) of the projected expenditure for biometric authentication services. Our strategy in this respect is to:

o | Expand the scope and range of services that we provide to and through our existing clients
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Continue to add significant new clients for our current and future services
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Offer our services via channel partners with substantial distribution networks
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Offer our technology on a “low code” basis, providing access via an orchestration layer and/or open-APIs to enable implementation by a broader range of clients
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The addition of alternate authentication tools including non-facial-biometric options and non-biometric-knowledge and device-based tools facilitating two and multi-factor authentication
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9




o | Offer our IT2 technology for use by other biometric and data services providers to protect and extend the usability of their data
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Provide ready-to-use / customizable platforms that leverage our IT2 technology in specialized markets
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Capital
Given the geographic diversity of its team, and to facilitate cost-effective administration, Trust Stamp secures the services of its permanent team members through a variety of administrative structures that include wholly owned subsidiaries, professional employer organizations and consulting contracts. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 10 full-time and 1 part-time team member that works out of the United States, 25 full-time members that work out of Malta, 7 full-time team members in Poland and Central Europe, 2 full-time and 4 part-time team members in the United Kingdom, 1 full-time team member in the Isle of Man, 15 full-time team members working in the Philippines, 13 full-time team members working in Rwanda, 1 full-time team member working in the Netherlands, 1 full-time team member in Denmark, and 3 full-time team members working remotely in India. Our permanent team is augmented as needed by contract development and other staff on both a long and short-term basis.
Outsourcing
We design and develop our own products. We use an outsourcing company, 10Clouds, for additional development staff as needed. 10Clouds is considered a related party. In addition, we also utilize SourceFit, a company in the Philippines, for PEO services, representing approximately 2% of our operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022. Amazon Web Services provides cloud hosting and processing services, representing approximately 2-3% of our operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Key Customers
Historically, the Company generated most of its income through a relationship with an S&P 500 bank, in which services were provided pursuant to a Master Software Agreement and statements of work. The scope of services provided to the S&P 500 bank has grown throughout the relationship and additional growth has been seen in 2021 and 2022. In recent years, the Company has also expanded its customer base to include relationships with Mastercard International (“Mastercard”), Fidelity Information Services, LLC (“FIS”), and other customers.
With respect to FIS, we continued to expand our work with our proprietary tokenization technology being utilized in FIS’ new global identity authentication system. In 2022, the Company implemented its “Orchestration Layer” platform – a low-code platform solution which streamlines delivery and implementation of the Company’s technologies. In the third quarter 2022, the Company acquired its first 2 customers on the Orchestration Layer platform through its partnership with FIS. In the fourth quarter, 4 additional customers onboarded, then 17 new customers since year-end, totaling to 23 total customers on the Orchestration Layer platform all related to FIS, including 23 financial institutions with over $50 billion in assets, as of February 2023. The Orchestration Layer platform is designed to be a one-stop shop for Trust Stamp services and provides for easy integration to our products; chargeable on a per-use basis and is accelerating the Company’s evolution from being exclusively a custom solutions provider to also offering a modular and highly scalable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model with low-code implementation. The Orchestration Layer utilizes the Company’s next-generation identity package, offering rapid deployment across devices and platforms, with custom workflows that seamlessly orchestrate trust across the identity lifecycle for a consistent user experience in processes for onboarding and KYC/AML, multi-factor authentication, account recovery, fraud prevention, compliance, and more. The Orchestration Layer that has been developed facilitates no-code and low-code implementations of the Company’s technology making adoption faster and even more cost-effective for a broader range of potential customers.

Under a ten-year technology services agreement (“the TSA”) with Mastercard International entered into in March 2019, the Company’s IT2 technology is being implemented by Mastercard for Humanitarian & Development purposes as a core element of its Community Pass and Inclusive Identity offerings. Use cases include not only financial services for individuals and businesses but also empowering people and communities to meet basic needs, such as nutritious food, clean water, housing, education, and healthcare including Ethiopia’s implementation of Mastercard’s Wellness Pass within Ethiopia’s health information system to promote efficiency in healthcare tracking and offline portability of health records. Under the TSA, the Company is paid to develop and host software solutions utilizing the IT2 and to support Mastercard’s implementations. In addition, the Company is paid on a “per use” basis for all transactions utilizing its technology. To date the Company has received guaranteed minimum annual payments on account of usage. In December of 2022, the Company entered into a modification of the agreed pricing schedule with Mastercard to move from a per-use to a per-user-year model to broaden the range of potential use cases. Under that agreement, Trust Stamp currently receives minimum annual payments on account of usage, and we anticipate use-based revenue starting in 2023 and growing year-on-year thereafter. The TSA may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured within thirty days after notice is received of such a breach. Either party may terminate the TSA if the other party becomes, including but not limited to, insolvent, subject to a bankruptcy, dissolved or liquidated. Unless the TSA is terminated, the TSA will automatically renew for additional one year-periods unless either party provides written notice within ninety days of intent not to renew.
As a result of investments in new business development staff and systems, as well as the introduction and expansion of the customer relationships described above, and while we value the relationship highly, management believes that we are no longer financially dependent on our relationship with the S&P 500 bank. As an example, the S&P 500 bank and Mastercard made up 33.6 % of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 46.3% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. On September 23, 2021, the Company was awarded a $3,920,764 contract (the “ICE Contract”) with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. This engagement required an investment in productization, business development, and satisfying extensive due diligence processes. Effective March 27, 2022, Trust Stamp agreed to a bilateral modification of the fixed price purchase order announced in September 2021 with ICE. The modification covered software development and services related to rapid enrolment in the ICE alternative to detention program and, increased the total contract award value to $7,176,364 from the original $3,920,764. On August 17, 2022, Trust Stamp received notification from ICE that it was terminating the ICE Contract for convenience effective immediately. ICE has paid Trust Stamp for the ICE Contract services performed prior to the amendment effective April 15, 2022. Additionally, Trust Stamp received $720 thousand in cancellation expenses incurred during the period between April 15, 2022 and August 17, 2022 for mobile service expense, storage expense, and payroll expense.
On September 15, 2022, the Company entered into a Master Services Agreement (“the MSA”) with Innovative Government Solutions (“IGS”) under which the Company and IGS will jointly offer services and IGS is granted a 12-year (renewable) license (“the license”) to resell the Company’s technology subject to payment by IGS of agreed revenue advances and end user license fees. On execution of the MSA, IGS agrees to pay $1,500,000 to the Company as a non-refundable revenue advance, an additional $1,500,000 non-refundable revenue advance on the first anniversary of the MSA, and $1,000,000 on each of the next two anniversaries of the MSA as additional non-refundable revenue advances. In February 2023, IGS agreed to pre-pay $750,000 of the first anniversary payment and payment is expected in March of 2023. IGS has the right to terminate the MSA for convenience before the additional non-refundable revenue advances become due in which case the unpaid additional non-refundable revenue advances will not be payable and the license will terminate. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Trust Stamp received the initial $1.5 million payment, recorded the non-refundable revenue advance to deferred revenue, and recognized no IGS revenue.
As we grow, we intend to continue to expand the number of customers from which we generate revenues including through the development of channel partnerships, such as our relationship with FIS. In the opinion of our management, we would be able to continue operations without our current customers (including our channel partnership with FIS). However, the unanticipated loss of the Company’s current customers could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position.
Regulation
Our business is not currently subject to any licensing requirements in any jurisdiction in which we operate, other than the requirement to hold a business license in the City of Atlanta (with which we are in compliance), and the requirement to hold a trading license in Rwanda (with which we are in compliance). This does not mean that licensing requirements may not be introduced in one or more jurisdiction in which we operate, and such requirements could be burdensome and/or expensive or even impose requirements that we are unable to meet.

11



We are subject to substantial governmental regulation relating to our technology and will continue to be for the lifetime of our Company. By virtue of handling sensitive PII and biometric data, we are subject to numerous statutes related to data privacy, and additional legislation and regulation should be anticipated in every jurisdiction in which we operate. Example federal (US) and European statutes we could be subject to are:

o | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
--+------------------------------------------------------------


o | Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR)
--+-------------------------------------------------------


o | ePrivacy Privacy Directive
--+---------------------------


o | The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
--+-----------------------------------------


o | The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
--+-------------------------------------------


o | Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)
--+-----------------------------------------

HIPAA and HITECH
Under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act “HITECH”), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information (“PHI”), used or disclosed by covered entities and business associates. Covered entities and business associates are subject to HIPAA and HITECH. Our subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, transmit, or otherwise process PHI on behalf of us are HIPAA “business associates” and must also comply with HIPAA as a business associate.
HIPAA and HITECH include privacy and security rules, breach notification requirements, and electronic transaction standards.
The privacy rules cover the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and business associates. The privacy rules generally prohibit the use or disclosure of PHI, except as permitted under certain limited circumstances. The privacy rules also set forth individual patient rights, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing his or her PHI, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of his or her PHI.
The security rules require covered entities and business associates to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronically transmitted or stored PHI by implementing administrative, physical, and technical safeguards. Under HITECH’s Breach Notification Rule, a covered entity must notify individuals, the Secretary of the HHS, and in some circumstances, the media of breaches of unsecured PHI.
In addition, we may be subject to state health information privacy and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI than HIPAA, and state laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts.
Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a failure to secure PHI, a complaint about our privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil and criminal fines and penalties and additional reporting and oversight obligations if such entities are required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
GDPR
The EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. It requires data controllers to implement more stringent operational 

12



requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, transparent and expanded disclosure to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) about how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements, and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR will be significant—the greater of €20 million or 4% of global turnover. The GDPR provides that EU member states may introduce further conditions, including limitations, to make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data.
ePrivacy Directive 
The ePrivacy directive sets out the rules relating to the processing of personal data across public communications networks. This directive requires business to ensure consent requests are made and that consent is received from the user before the use of cookies is made. Businesses must communicate the privacy rules with accurate and specific information regarding the data contained in the cookie. Information must be communicated before the consent requests are made, in plain language. Organizations must ensure that users are able to withdraw consent in the same simple manner as the initial consent request. 
CRPA and CCPA
The CRPA and CCPA define and establish various rights that consumers residing in California have over the privacy of their data along with the responsibilities of businesses when collecting personal information. It requires businesses that control the collection of consumers’ personal information to inform them of the category, purpose and duration the business intends to retain such information. It lists the consumers’ right to correct their data and have their data deleted. Customers may also exercise their right to limit the sale or sharing of their personal or sensitive personal information. Fines for non-compliance can range from $100 to $750 per consumer per incident. Additionally, in certain cases the California Privacy Protection Agency may impose administrative fines ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 for each violation. 
BIPA
BIPA, which was enacted in 2008, addresses the collection, use and retention of biometric information by private entities. Under the law, a private entity must inform an individual, or their legally authorized individual, that the biometric information is being collected and stored, and the specific purpose and the length of time for the collection, storage and use of the biometric information, before obtaining or possessing their biometric information for the purposes of capturing, storing or sharing it. In addition, prior to collecting any biometric information, the regulation required businesses to obtain a written release for the collection of the biometric information from the individual, or the individual’s legally authorized representative after notice has been given. BIPA provides statutory damages of up to $1,000 for each negligent violation, and up to $5,000 for each intentional or reckless violation.

Subsidiaries and Affiliates
Given the geographic diversity of our team and to facilitate cost-effective administration, Trust Stamp conducts various aspects of its operations through subsidiaries. All subsidiaries share resources across the entire Trust Stamp organization. The officers and directors of Trust Stamp have influence over the operations of all subsidiaries and employees across jurisdictions. Only one of our subsidiaries, Biometric Innovations Limited, has its own management team.
T Stamp Inc. Corporate Structure Chart
​
TStamp Incentive Holdings. On April 9, 2019, management created a new entity, TStamp Incentive Holdings (“TSIH”) to which the Company issued 320,513 shares of Class A Common Stock that the Board of Directors of TSIH could use for employee stock awards in the future. The purpose of the entity was to provide an analogous structure to a traditional stock incentive plan. As of the date of this report, 262,546 shares of Class A Common Stock are still held by TSIH – however, all of these shares of Class A Common Stock have been allocated for issuance pursuant to the RSUs that vested on January 2, 2023 and all RSUs vested during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company has no plans to issue additional equity securities to TSIH. As such, once these remaining shares are issued, it is expected this entity will become dormant going forward.
Biometric Innovations Limited (formerly “Trust Stamp Fintech Limited”). Biometric Innovations is our Company’s United Kingdom operating subsidiary. It was established to act as the contracting entity for development contractors in the UK, and it has its own board and management team. The purpose of this entity was to establish beachhead operations in the country to service a contract entered by the Company with the National Association of Realtors and Property Mark. This entity serves as a sales and marketing function for the product “NAEA” which was developed for the contract between the listed parties. On June 11, 2020, the Company entered into a stock exchange transaction with Biometric Innovations Limited, becoming a 100% owner of the entity. The stock exchange transaction was not pursuant to any formal written agreement.
Trust Stamp Malta Limited. Trust Stamp Malta Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of T Stamp Inc. It operates an R&D Campus in the Republic of Malta, for which it has entered into a lease with a local commercial landlord in Malta, Vassallo Group Realty Ltd. The goal of Trust Stamp Malta Limited is to advance our biometric authentication technology. As part of the creation of this entity, we entered into an agreement with the government of Malta for a repayable advance of up to €800,000 to cover 75% of the first 24 months of payroll costs for any employee who begins 36 months from the execution of the agreement on July 8, 2020.
Trust Stamp Rwanda Limited. The Company opened an office in Rwanda, Africa in April 2021 and signed a one-year lease for office space commencing May 1, 2021 and renewing annually unless otherwise terminated. The Company has established an R&D center in Rwanda together with a back-office facility for the purpose of our expansion into Africa.
