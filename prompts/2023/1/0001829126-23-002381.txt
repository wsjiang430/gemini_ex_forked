ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
General Description of Business
 
Structure
 
Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc. (“Lightstone REIT III”), which was formerly known as Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. before September 16, 2021, is a Maryland corporation formed on October 5, 2012, which elected to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2015.
 
Lightstone REIT III is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (“UPREIT”), and substantially all of its current and future business is and will be conducted through Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). As of December 31, 2022, Lightstone REIT III had a 99% general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership’s common units.
 
Lightstone REIT III and the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the “Company” and the use of “we,” “our,” “us” or similar pronouns in this annual report refers to the Lightstone REIT III, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used.
 
Through our Operating Partnership, we own, operate and develop commercial properties and make real estate-related investments. Since our inception, we have primarily acquired and operated commercial hospitality properties, principally consisting of limited-service-hotels all located in the United States. However, our commercial holdings may also consist of full-service hotels, and to a lesser extent, retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), industrial and office properties. Our real estate investments are held by us alone or jointly with other parties. In addition, we may invest up to 20% of our net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which we may acquire directly. Although most of our investments are these types, we may invest in whatever types of real estate or real estate-related investments that we believe are in our best interests. We evaluate all of our real estate investments as one operating segment. We currently intend to hold our investments until such time as we determine that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we (i) majority owned and consolidated the operating results and financial condition of eight limited-service hotels containing a total of 872 rooms, (ii) held an unconsolidated 50.0% membership interest in LVP LIC Hotel JV LLC (the “Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture”) and (iii) held an unconsolidated 25.0% membership interest in Bedford Avenue Holdings LLC (the “Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture”). We account for our unconsolidated membership interests in the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture under the equity method of accounting.
 
The Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture owns a 183-room, limited-service hotel (the “Hilton Garden Inn – Long Island City) located in the Long Island City neighborhood in the Queens borough of New York City. The Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture developed, constructed and owns a 210-room branded hotel (the “Williamsburg Moxy Hotel”) located in the Williamsburg neighborhood in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, which opened on March 7, 2023. Both the Hilton Garden Inn Joint Venture and the Williamsburg Moxy Hotel Joint Venture are between us and related parties.

Our advisor is Lightstone Value Plus REIT III LLC (the “Advisor”), which is majority owned by David Lichtenstein. On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed $2 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. Our Advisor also owns 20,000 shares of our common stock (“Common Shares”) which were issued on December 24, 2012 for $200, or $10.00 per share. Mr. Lichtenstein also is the majority owner of the equity interests of the Lightstone Group, LLC. The Lightstone Group, LLC served as our sponsor (the “Sponsor”) during our initial public offering (the “Offering”) which terminated on March 31, 2017. Mr. Lichtenstein owns 222,222 Common Shares which were issued on December 11, 2014 for $2.0 million, or $9.00 per share. Pursuant to the terms of an advisory agreement and subject to the oversight of our board of directors (the “Board of Directors”), the Advisor has primary responsibility for making investment decisions on our behalf and managing our day-to-day operations. Through his ownership and control of The Lightstone Group, LLC, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect owner and manager of Lightstone SLP III LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Special Limited Partner”), which owns 242 subordinated participation interests (“Subordinated Participation Interests”) in the Operating Partnership which were acquired for $12.1 million in connection with our Offering. Mr. Lichtenstein also acts as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. As a result, he exerts influence over but does not control Lightstone REIT III or the Operating Partnership.
 
We have no employees. Our Advisor and its affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including asset management, accounting, legal, and property management, as well as investor relations services.
 
We are dependent on the Advisor and its affiliates for services that are essential to us, including asset management and acquisition, disposition and financing activities, and other general administrative responsibilities. If the Advisor and its affiliates are unable to provide these services to us, we would be required to provide the services ourselves or obtain the services from other parties.
 
We also use other unaffiliated third-party property managers, principally for the management of our hospitality properties.
 
Our Common Shares are not currently listed on a national securities exchange. We may seek to list our Common Shares for trading on a national securities exchange only if a majority of our independent directors believe listing would be in the best interest of our stockholders. We do not intend to list our Common Shares at this time. We do not anticipate that there would be any active market for our Common Shares until they are listed for trading.
 
On January 17, 2023, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement to our charter pursuant to which we are no longer required to either (a) amend our charter to extend the deadline to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event, or (b) hold a stockholders meeting to vote on a proposal for an orderly liquidation of our portfolio.
 
Noncontrolling Interests – Partners of the Operating Partnership
 
Limited Partner
 
On July 16, 2014, the Advisor contributed $2 to the Operating Partnership in exchange for 200 limited partner units in the Operating Partnership. The Advisor has the right to convert the limited partner units into cash or, at our option, an equal number of our Common Shares.
Special Limited Partner
 
In connection with our Offering, the Special Limited Partner purchased from the Operating Partnership an aggregate of 242 Subordinated Participation Interests for consideration of $12.1 million. The Subordinated Participation Interests were each purchased for $50 in consideration and may be entitled to receive liquidation distributions upon the liquidation of Lightstone REIT III.
 
As the majority owner of the Special Limited Partner, Mr. Lichtenstein is the beneficial owner of a 99% interest in such Subordinated Participation Interests and will thus receive an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof.
 
These Subordinated Participation Interests entitle the Special Limited Partner to a portion of any regular and liquidation distributions that we make to our stockholders, but only after our stockholders have received a stated preferred return. From our inception through December 31, 2022, no distributions have been declared or paid on the Subordinated Participation Interests.

Related Parties
 
Our Sponsor, Advisor and their affiliates, including the Special Limited Partner, are related parties of ours as well as other public REITs also sponsored and/or advised by these entities. Pursuant to the terms of various agreements, certain of these entities are entitled to compensation and reimbursement of costs incurred for services related to the investment, development, management and disposition of our assets. The compensation is generally based on the cost of acquired properties/investments and the annual revenue earned from such properties/investments, and other such fees and expense reimbursements as outlined in each of the respective agreements. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Primary Investment Objectives
 
Our primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk. We intend to achieve this goal primarily through investments in real estate properties.
Investment Strategy and Policies
 
We have and expect to continue to invest in commercial properties (including full-service or limited-service hotels and extended-stay hotels) and residential properties, as well as other real estate-related investments principally in North America. Our acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities including restaurants, concierge and room service, porter service or valet parking. Limited-service hotels typically do not include these amenities. Extended-stay hotels offer upscale, high-quality, residential style lodging with a comprehensive package of guest services and amenities for extended-stay business and leisure travelers. We have no limitation as to the brand of franchise or license with which our hotels are associated. We generally intend to hold each acquired property until its investment objectives are met or it is likely they will not be met.
 
Even though we have and expect to continue primarily to acquire hotels, we have and may continue to purchase other types of real estate. Assets other than hotels may include, without limitation, office buildings, shopping centers, business and industrial parks, manufacturing facilities, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, student housing properties, warehouses and distribution facilities and medical office properties. We have and expect to continue to invest mainly in direct real estate investments and other equity interests; however, we may also invest in debt interests, which may include bridge or mezzanine loans, including in furtherance of a loan-to-own strategy. We have not established any limits on the percentage of our portfolio that may be comprised of various categories of assets which present differing levels of risk.
 
We have and expect to continue to enter into joint ventures, tenant-in-common investments or other co-ownership arrangements for the acquisition, development or improvement of properties with third parties or certain affiliates of our Advisor, including other present and future REITs and real estate limited partnerships sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor.
 
Financing Strategy and Policies
 
There is no limitation on the amount we may invest or borrow for the purchase of any single asset. Our charter allows us to incur leverage up to 300% of our total “net assets” (as defined in Section I.B of the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments. We may only exceed this 300% limit if a majority of our independent directors approves each borrowing in excess of this limit and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with a justification for the excess borrowing. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by the Board of Directors at least quarterly.
 
We do not currently intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. Careful use of debt will help us to achieve our diversification goals because we will have more funds available for investment. However, high levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors.

Tax Status and Income Taxes
 
We elected to be taxed and qualify as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income that we distribute currently to our stockholders. To maintain our REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT in any subsequent year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Additionally, even if we continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and to U.S. federal income taxes and excise taxes on our undistributed income, if any.
 
To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), including when we acquire a hotel we usually establish a TRS and enter into an operating lease agreement for the hotel. As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and franchise taxes from these activities.
 
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no material uncertain income tax positions.
 
Current Environment
 
Our operating results and financial condition are substantially impacted by the overall health of local, U.S. national and global economies and may be influenced by market and other challenges. Additionally, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic and other conditions; including, but not limited to, availability or terms of financings, financial markets volatility and uncertainty as a result of recent banking failures, political upheaval or uncertainty, natural and man-made disasters, terrorism and acts of war, unfavorable changes in laws and regulations, outbreaks of contagious diseases, cybercrime, loss of key relationships, inflation and recession.
 
Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions and their impacts on consumer behavior. Worsening economic conditions, increases in costs due to inflation, higher interest rates, certain labor and supply chain challenges, developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other changes in economic conditions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.
 
Competition
 
The hotel and other commercial real estate markets are highly competitive. This competition could reduce occupancy levels and revenues at our properties, which would adversely affect our operations. We face competition from many sources. We face competition from other hotels both in the immediate vicinity and the geographic market where our hotels are located. Overbuilding in the hotel industry may increase the number of rooms available and may decrease occupancy and room rates. In addition, increases in operating costs due to inflation may not be offset by increased room rates. We also face competition from nationally recognized hotel brands with which we are not associated.
 
We have or may compete in all of our markets with other owners and operators of retail, office, industrial and residential real estate. The continued development of new retail, office, industrial and residential properties has intensified the competition among owners and operators of these types of real estate in many market areas in which we intend to operate. We compete based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. The number of competing properties in a particular market could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on the operating expenses of our properties.

In addition, we compete with other entities engaged in real estate investment activities to locate suitable properties to acquire and to locate tenants and purchasers for our properties. These competitors include other REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. There are also other REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours and others that may be organized in the future. Some of these competitors, including larger REITs, have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we will have and generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of tenants. In addition, these same entities seek financing through similar channels to those sought by us. Therefore, we will compete for institutional investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.
 
Competition from these and other third-party real estate investors may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us. It may also result in higher prices, lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs, making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms.
 
We believe that our senior management’s experience, coupled with our financing, professionalism, diversity of investments and reputation in the industry enables us to compete with the other real estate investment companies.
 
Because we are organized as an UPREIT, we believe we are well positioned within the hospitality industry and any industries in which we operate to potentially offer existing property owners the opportunity to contribute properties to us in tax-deferred transactions using our Operating Partnership units as transactional currency. As a result, we believe we may have a competitive advantage over most of our competitors that are structured as traditional REITs and non-REITs in pursuing acquisitions with tax-sensitive sellers.
 
Regulations
 
Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances, and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, and environmental matters. We believe that we have or will obtain all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments.
Environmental
 
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of U.S. federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest, or on properties that may be acquired directly or indirectly in the future.
