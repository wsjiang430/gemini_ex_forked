​
The Evolution of Ultrasound
​
Digital health is systematically changing the way healthcare practitioners deliver care by providing information that informs better decision-making, while increasing access and significantly reducing patient-care costs. Butterfly iQ+ is designed for this new wave of medical care with an easy-to-use interface that displays ultrasound information on your smartphone or tablet in real-time. 
​
Historically, the global ultrasound market has been dominated by traditional cart-based devices. These devices are accessible only to highly specialized, highly trained technicians and are located predominantly in hospitals, imaging centers, and physicians’ offices. Many healthcare institutions throughout the world lack the facilities and capital necessary to acquire and maintain expensive cart-based devices and cannot afford the highly trained individuals required to operate them. 
​
Traditional cart-based equipment typically ranges from $45,000 to $60,000 per new device in the mid-range and is required to be operated by trained healthcare professionals. More recently, we have seen the introduction of point-of-care ultrasound (“POCUS”) and handheld devices with an average price point of $10,000, based on $3,000 to $7,000 per probe, some requiring two to three probes to cover a comparable range of cleared indications to the single probe Butterfly iQ+ and an upfront software investment for access to advanced imaging modes (e.g. pulsed-wave Doppler) and workflow (e.g. cloud storage) which can reach upwards of $2,000. Further, these POCUS devices operate off the same platform as traditional cart-based ultrasound, limited by their application of the same 60-year-old piezoelectric crystal technology, leaving limited opportunity for future progress. In contrast, we believe our Ultrasound-on-Chip™ technology can help accelerate the future, by enabling rapid innovation and miniaturization to deploy new form factors and technologies. The transition from traditional crystal sensors to semiconductor chip in ultrasound is designed to enable the portability, versatility, and affordability of medical imaging that we believe provides a competitive advantage for our technology.
​
Although still required to be operated by trained healthcare practitioners, we are developing a technology roadmap to make it easier for users of all skill levels to use the device. We are focused on increasing the use of imaging during preventive care with the aim to provide the right information earlier in the care process to enable better, more rapid clinical decision making. As we continue to educate and empower ease-of-use, we believe that adoption of ultrasound information as a clinical assessment tool will grow and, in time, we will change the paradigm of care delivery. We believe that this information delivered through imaging with an intuitive user interface will further drive costs down and expand the use of imaging at clinical point-of-care.
​
Changing standards of care can take decades, but our goal is to make this change happen much faster. We believe AI integration will be one key to accelerating the transition to handheld ultrasound, as it enables ease of use and automation, thereby removing barriers to adoption. We are also committed to empowering the next generation of medical professionals with ultrasound skills and clinical integration knowledge, by bringing Butterfly iQ+ to medical schools across the country.
​
Market Opportunity
​
Long term, we are on a journey to address a potential new market that we estimate exceeds $100 billion. We believe our solution addresses an unmet need across an addressable market of 45 million healthcare practitioners, including approximately 2 million veterinarians and veterinary technicians, 13 million medical doctors and 30 million nurses and midwives worldwide. 
​

In the near term, we are first driving adoption with healthcare practitioners, including doctors and nurses in healthcare systems and a focused group of initial customers in the veterinary market, comprised of companion animal, mixed animal, equine veterinarians and veterinary academic institutions.
​
We believe our solution can address this market and moves beyond the restrictions of the existing ultrasound market, because our solution empowers practitioners with imaging information at point-of-care that is practical, mobile, interoperable, and easy-to-use. Our aspiration is to be as ubiquitous as the stethoscope and a tool used by physicians everywhere and anywhere care is delivered.
​
We believe our differentiated Butterfly iQ+ handheld device and our growing user base of healthcare systems, medical schools and individual practitioners, position us well to drive an evolution in healthcare. Similar to the human patient market, our solution for the veterinarian market is also driving an impact in veterinary care and education.
​
We believe the valuable information generated from a small handheld with low cost, quality imaging and an interface designed for ease-of-use are attractive to healthcare systems that seek to improve care at lower cost. These attributes also may allow the use of our Butterfly iQ+ by practitioners beyond traditional health system environments to where health systems look to evolve, such as the home. This evolution would enable the application of ultrasound information in broad clinical utility and practice with patient-performed scanning to home monitoring, subject to our obtaining appropriate marketing authorizations for such intended uses. 
​
The advantages of our technology align with recent industry trends, including the shift to in-home medical care, affordability, harnessing of AI and deep learning, collaboration through the cloud, disruptive medical innovation, and increasing access to care. In addition, by expanding the settings in which medical imaging can be done, the Butterfly iQ+ device may provide opportunities for earlier detection and prevention of disease, while reducing cost. This aligns with the focus on consumer health empowerment, wellness, and acceleration of value-based care, all of which are important themes in the healthcare industry today.
​
Business Strategy
​
As the first semiconductor-based, handheld, whole-body ultrasound devices, the Butterfly iQ and iQ+ cloud-based solution is a leading part of the medical imaging revolution. Leveraging this novel technology, our solution can scan, process and store high quality images at the bedside that can then be transferred between systems, as well as address hospital and health system workflows, an interoperability valued by customers in today’s market. 
​
We believe that with our current products and solutions, we have created a new standard for medical imaging, and we are focused on staying at the leading edge of technical innovation. We believe our current portfolio is only the first step in our development and we plan to continually improve it and expand our product and service offerings. In 2022, we launched Butterfly Blueprint and Compass software, an expanded solution, which we are implementing within healthcare systems to enable these customers to deploy our solution at scale.
​
We believe that through the penetration of the existing addressable market, and the potential subsequent expansion into new markets, as well as places that do not currently use medical imaging or where access to imaging is limited, we can bring the adoption of medical imaging to greater scale in countries where there is limited access to healthcare. 
​
In the near-term, we are focused on key markets and opportunities to innovate and grow as we develop a new market. We are driving adoption of Butterfly across four areas: 

1) | Hospitals and healthcare systems, initially focused in the United States;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Expanding into international markets and driving global health equity to improve care across all settings;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Moving Butterfly into home-based care, subject to appropriate authorizations; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Capturing opportunities in adjacent markets to drive growth.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------

​
Across these four areas, we have three core principles that will help drive adoption that we call our “3 E’s” – our commitment to ensure that Butterfly is: Easy, Everywhere, and Economical.
​

● | Easy to use, enabling access to the most information with the least amount of effort through education, an intuitive interface and AI.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Everywhere, the scope of our journey to change the standard of care. We are focused on making Butterfly useful in more settings with cutting edge features and capabilities and building new business models to put Butterfly into every clinician’s pocket. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Economical, creating, capturing and delivering value and affordability for all. We are focused on completing health economics studies to demonstrate that our system delivers better, more informed, lower cost care.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Because the Butterfly iQ+ is mobile and easy-to-use, healthcare practitioners can have access to ultrasound information outside of traditional settings, increasing convenience for both practitioners and patients. This could improve health outcomes, while avoiding expensive treatments, generating economic value for both the patient and payor, which is aligned with the healthcare mega-trend of value-based care. As our device reaches new markets and new users and, with appropriate marketing authorizations, enables more direct interaction with patients, including remote patient monitoring, we believe this trend will accelerate, further improving outcomes and reducing costs. This reduction of costs has the potential to create economic value for the whole healthcare system across clinical applications and markets where ultrasound scanning is used.
​
Longer term, as patient-focused, value-based care delivery models continue to scale, we believe handheld ultrasound devices will find a potential market in at-home care settings with at-home medical personnel and patient-performed scanning, subject to appropriate authorizations. From congestive heart failure to renal failure and bladder monitoring, we have already identified key clinical applications that we wish to target and are incorporating these applications into our roadmap. We will work diligently to validate target at-home applications through focused clinical trials and will seek additional regulatory authorizations, as needed.
​

​
Our current product portfolio includes a combination of hardware and software, including Butterfly iQ and iQ+ probes, software subscriptions and the Butterfly Blueprint platform. In addition, we also offer cloud-based software solutions to healthcare systems, teleguidance, in-app educational tutorials, formal education programs through our Butterfly Academy software, as well as clinical support and services for large scale deployments.
​
Butterfly iQ and iQ+
In 2018, Legacy Butterfly commercially launched Butterfly iQ, the world’s first handheld, single-probe, whole-body ultrasound system using semiconductor technology that is commercially available, and in 2020, Legacy Butterfly launched the Butterfly iQ+ with additional features and improved performance. We expect to continue development of our Butterfly iQ+ device with product offerings that may include enhanced performance, additional procedural applications, changes to enable and encourage usage and alternative form factors.
​
We have sold and shipped more than 80,000 Butterfly iQ and Butterfly iQ+ devices (“iQ devices”). Butterfly iQ+’s list price is approximately $2,700 per device, making it a high-quality and affordable alternative to the costly traditional cart-based equipment and a number of other handheld devices currently on the market. Powered by our Ultrasound-on-Chip™, Butterfly’s high-performance imaging capabilities support fast and confident clinical decision-making, and in 2022, we continued to improve the technology driving the iQ devices, providing enhanced chip technology, AI capabilities and image quality.
​
Our Butterfly iQ+ device connects directly to a compatible iPhone or Android smartphone or tablet to provide its imaging and software features for more than two consecutive hours according to average use as determined from field data analytics and charges to full battery in approximately five hours. In select countries, our proprietary software harnesses AI designed to drive ease-of-use for image acquisition and improved analysis used to guide and educate practitioners, as well as provide quality control.

In addition, our software application also features TeleGuidance, which is the first integrated ultrasound telemedicine platform. This tool allows a remote, trained healthcare practitioner to view and guide the ultrasound imaging through the smartphone application and live video.
​
Butterfly iQ+ Vet
In 2021, we launched Butterfly iQ+ Vet, a handheld ultrasound system that leverages the technology developed for our other iQ devices and is designed to bring value to veterinarians in a variety of care settings, helping to usher in a new standard for veterinary medicine.
​
As of December 31, 2022, iQ+ Vet is available in approximately 20 international markets, bringing first-of-its-kind innovation to veterinarians. The product includes a specially designed animal-specific probe for ease of use and maneuvering, Color-Doppler and NeedleViz. We are changing the way that veterinarians deliver care, providing more information through imaging at the point-of-care, particularly since their patients do not speak.
​
Marketing and Sales
​
We market our products through our targeted U.S. sales organization, which is engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily to health institutions as well as to healthcare institutions through direct sales and distributor partnerships. In the United States, Butterfly has been purchased by a clinician in most of the largest 100 healthcare systems. We use a variety of marketing tools to drive adoption, foster continued usage and establish brand loyalty for our devices and software. We recognize the importance of the role of education in accelerating adoption of our products by those medical professionals without existing ultrasound skills.
​
We sell through three main channels:

● | Distributor, veterinary and affiliate relationships to unlock additional channels to supplement our direct and eCommerce sales.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In 2022, we continued to develop our salesforce and sales support teams with the ultimate goal of growing adoption at large scale healthcare systems. In 2023, we plan to improve the effectiveness of our client experience function to work with our customers to deploy Butterfly iQ+ and Butterfly BlueprintTM. We believe that we can build a community of healthcare system customers around our solution to share insights, techniques, and new regulatory-compliant ways of applying our solution, all of which we believe should continue to drive clinical behavior change, adoption and retention, as well as clinical and economic studies. 
​
As we expanded our healthcare system software offerings and developed relationships with larger health systems in 2022, we have continued to increase the proportion of our sales to health systems compared to eCommerce. Because institutions often make decisions to purchase on a system-wide level, we believe enterprise sales can generate economies of scale with larger volumes and larger numbers of users, while also increasing user retention. The health system channel also yields more comprehensive software subscriptions, which further increases our revenue from devices and subscriptions sold. We are working towards increasingly integrated solutions to maximize our value to large healthcare customers, as well as continuing to improve our sales and support infrastructure. Our ability to connect and integrate with traditional third-party ultrasound systems gives enterprise customers a solution to the governance and workflow challenges that may have previously limited the utilization and billing of point of care imaging devices. Health system customers deploying our solution can benefit from a streamlined clinical workflow that reduces the exam documentation burden typically associated with traditional ultrasound systems. By adopting Butterfly BlueprintTM and CompassTM software, customers can responsibly manage and optimize value from their fleets of point of care imaging devices.
​
We continue to develop our sales and marketing organization, which consists of a dedicated sales team, sales operations and sales support personnel that are complemented by a marketing team. As of January 31, 2023, we had approximately 60 people employed globally in sales, sales support, and marketing.
​
Geographic Areas
​
Butterfly iQ+ is being used in approximately 30 markets. Outside of our core commercial geographies, Butterfly iQ+ is also being utilized in over 70 low resource settings around the world, where we have collaborations with non-governmental organizations (“NGOs”) like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (“BMGF”) to deliver our technology to underserved communities. Currently, we have placed our device with over 350 NGOs, entities and healthcare professionals that align with our mission to deliver care around the world and bring potentially lifesaving medical imaging to patients, often for the first time.
​
POCUS capabilities have been commercially available for decades, yet adoption in low-and-middle income countries is minimal. Butterfly’s global health program seeks to upend that paradigm by leveraging our technology to democratize medical imaging for marginalized and vulnerable populations around the world. Notably, in 2022 we completed the first half of a monumental 1,000 Butterfly iQ+ deployment to Sub-Saharan Africa under a $5.5 million BMGF grant. The program demonstrated that Butterfly’s solution is simple and intuitive enough to train over 500 mid-level practitioners, who had no prior ultrasound knowledge, to become proficient in scanning in less than 10 weeks.
​
We see our work in the areas of maternal and fetal health as the building blocks for continued impact toward better clinical assessment overall, and we believe our model is applicable to many more geographies and specialties. We anticipate leveraging our work in Sub-Saharan Africa to continue improving access to imaging in other limited resource settings, and we aim to further expand our international customer base in the future. In terms of geographic markets, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, a substantial majority of our revenues were derived from sales to customers based in the United States. We believe our differentiated Butterfly iQ+ handheld device and our growing user base of Butterfly iQ+ practitioners, with sales to or agreements with most of the largest 100 U.S. healthcare systems and across approximately 30 countries, position us well to compete in the existing ultrasound market and to potentially expand into emerging markets.

​
The Butterfly iQ+ leverages pre-existing, routine Current Procedural Terminology® codes (“CPT codes”) that enable healthcare providers and practitioners to obtain per-scan reimbursement in the specialties of anesthesiology, cardiology, critical care, emergency medicine, endocrinology and ultrasound-guided procedures. We intend to pursue incremental, new or expansionary CPT codes for reimbursement in future scan categories and categories concurrent to support the successful go-to-market strategy of the product pipeline.
​
Competition

Several large companies, such as GE HealthCare, Philips and Fujifilm Sonosite, currently constitute the bulk of ultrasound sales. High regulatory, distribution, manufacturing and service-related long-term contractual costs represent significant barriers to entry for any new player. We expect that the existing market participants will remain strong active players in the future.
​
As a general matter, we view competition on two levels:

● | Conventional ultrasound systems; and
--+-------------------------------------


● | The development of other handheld ultrasound systems with the same or better attributes.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The primary competition comes from established market participants offering conventional ultrasound systems. While Butterfly's target is often non-traditional ultrasound users, we do compete with both traditional ultrasound manufacturers and other handheld ultrasound systems.

The key custom-made component in the Butterfly iQ+ probe is the ultrasound transducer module consisting of a custom micro-electro-mechanical systems ultrasound semiconductor chip and lens.

We purchase some of our components and materials used in manufacturing, including the transducer module, from single sources. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement components, which could negatively affect our ability to supply our products on a timely basis. We cannot give assurances that any alternative supplier would be able to recreate the manufacturing processes currently in use. To mitigate this risk, we typically carry a significant inventory of critical components.

Many of our Butterfly iQ+ probes are manufactured, tested and shipped by Benchmark Electronics, Inc. (“Benchmark”) from its facilities in Thailand and New Hampshire. We believe that this manufacturing strategy and supply chain is efficient and conserves capital. However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer for our Butterfly iQ+ products, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so, and our business could be harmed.

Key Agreements

Foundry Service Agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

We entered into a Foundry Service Agreement (the “FSA”) with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (“TSMC”) in March 2019, as amended on October 1, 2020, under which TSMC agreed to manufacture integrated circuits used for the semiconductor chips in our probes. The FSA allows us to place purchase orders with TSMC, which are not binding until accepted by TSMC. The FSA also provides for TSMC to use commercially reasonable efforts to manufacture our products at TSMC and for us to meet monthly minimum purchase obligations. Under the FSA, we prepaid an amount to TSMC to be used against a portion of the purchase price for future purchases once the prepayment amount is reached. To the extent that we fail to fulfill our monthly wafer consumption requirement, TSMC has the right to deduct the shortfall from payments made by us to TSMC. In addition, we are required to buy back from TSMC unused raw wafers that TSMC purchases from its supplier.
 ​
The FSA also provides that TSMC will indemnify us for intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims against us related to the wafer manufacturing process and that we will indemnify TSMC for any intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims arising from TSMC’s compliance with our instructions, specifications, designs or requirements to manufacture, sell, or ship the wafers or arising from any harm caused by our medical device products.
 ​
The FSA’s current term expires on December 31, 2024, subject to automatic renewal for successive two-year terms unless terminated by either party upon three months’ notice prior to the end of the then-current term. The FSA may also be terminated by written notice at any time upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of or upon or after a material breach by the other party. After the initial two-year term (which ended on December 31, 2022), either party may terminate the FSA immediately, with or without cause, by giving the other party 12 months’ prior written notice of termination. In addition, TSMC may terminate the FSA if we do not place a purchase order for a period of 12 consecutive months or upon certain change of control transactions, including a merger, consolidation or other change of control or similar transactions to which we are party involving a semiconductor provider.
 ​
In connection with the FSA, we and TSMC developed a proprietary manufacturing process and continue to collaborate on manufacturing process improvements.

Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Benchmark Electronics, Inc.

In October 2015, we entered into a Manufacture and Supply Agreement (the “MSA”) with Benchmark, as amended on August 2019 and February 2021. Under the MSA, Benchmark agreed to manufacture our products pursuant to binding purchase orders, as well as non-binding forecasts. The parties have agreed to meet periodically regarding any minimum order quantities under the MSA.
 ​
Under the terms of the MSA, we granted Benchmark a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, fully-paid, royalty-free license, without the right to sublicense, to use our technology solely to manufacture our products. The MSA provides that we will own any right, title and interest in any improvements or modifications to our technology made in the course of performance of Benchmark’s obligations under the MSA. We and Benchmark also agreed to indemnify each other against certain third-party claims.
 ​
Pursuant to the February 2021 amendment, we agreed to provide global production exclusivity to Benchmark for our current products and other handheld probes which may be manufactured for us, for a specified exclusivity period, in exchange for delayed payment of certain invoices that we paid in March 2021. The exclusivity period is terminable and we have the right to purchase products from another supplier in the event that Benchmark fails to deliver more than 10% of the products, based on the revenue of orders during the then-current calendar quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we have the right to purchase our products from third parties other than Benchmark, subject to prior notice.
 ​
The MSA’s current term expires on October 1, 2024, subject to automatic renewal for successive two-year terms unless either party gives 180 days’ prior written notice before the end of the then-current term to the other party electing not to renew the MSA. The MSA or any purchase order under the MSA may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to the other party. The MSA may also be terminated by either party by written notice upon the occurrence of (i) a breach by the other party under the MSA which is not cured within 30 days after written notice by the terminating party, (ii) the other party becomes insolvent, dissolves, liquidates or ceases to conduct business or (iii) the occurrence of payment-related breaches. Benchmark may also terminate the MSA upon the filing of any petition against us under bankruptcy or similar laws, where such petition is not vacated within 10 days via court order. 

Exclusive Distribution Agreement with Cardinal Health 105, Inc.

In July 2018, we entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement (the “Distribution Agreement”) with Cardinal Health 105, Inc. (“Cardinal Health”). Under the Distribution Agreement, Cardinal Health acts as the distribution agent and authorized distributor of record of our products to our customers, including, but not limited to, wholesalers, specialty distributors, physicians, clinics, hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, in the United States. Under the Distribution Agreement, we provide Cardinal Health with forecasts of the volume of our products to be handled and distributed by Cardinal Health. We make payments to Cardinal Health for its distribution services pursuant to a fee schedule.
 ​
The Distribution Agreement’s current term expires on August 31, 2024. The Distribution Agreement is subject to automatic renewal for additional successive two-year terms unless we terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice or Cardinal Health terminates the Distribution Agreement upon written notice of non-renewal to us at least 180 days prior to the end of the then-current term. Either party may terminate the Distribution Agreement upon (i) the other party’s entry into bankruptcy proceedings, receipt of a bankruptcy order that is not discharged within 30 days, or similar events, or (ii) a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 30 days after the non-breaching party gives written notice. Additionally, if we breach our payment obligations under the Distribution Agreement and such breach is not cured within 15 days after Cardinal Health provides written notice of non-payment, Cardinal Health may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ prior written notice.

Intellectual Property

Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies.

17




The patents owned and in-licensed by us are generally directed to the architecture of our ultrasonic imaging devices, our microfabricated ultrasonic transducers and machine learning for ultrasound applications. We have developed a portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications directed to commercial products and technologies for potential development. We believe that our intellectual property is a core strength of our business, and our strategy includes the continued development of our patent portfolio.

Butterfly iQ, iQ+ and Related Technology

As of December 31, 2022, we owned approximately 900 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea and India. These issued patents and pending patent applications (if they were to be issued as patents) have expected expiration dates ranging between approximately 2030 and 2042.
​
In addition to patents, we also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from using or incorporating the proprietary rights of third parties during their engagement with us. We also generally require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.

License Agreements

We have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business relating to our technologies or other intellectual property rights or assets.

Exclusive (Equity) Agreement with Leland Stanford Junior University

In June 2013, we entered into an Exclusive (Equity) Agreement (the “Stanford Agreement”) with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (“Stanford”). Pursuant to the Stanford Agreement, Stanford granted us a co-exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell products covered by patent rights to Stanford’s wafer bonding technology. The rights licensed to us are for ultrasound applications using the wafer bonding technology excluding certain applications, and the license remains exclusive, except for certain non-exclusive applications, until the earlier of December 23, 2023, or the seventh anniversary of the first sale of any product using the licensed technology, and thereafter will be nonexclusive until the last licensed patent expires. The last licensed patent is currently expected to expire in 2030. The rights licensed to us, except for the non-exclusive applications, are sublicensable during such exclusive term, subject to our continued development or sale of the products using the technology licensed under the agreement and, following the exclusive term, subject to Stanford’s prior approval. The Stanford Agreement outlines certain milestones to be met by us in connection with the development and sales of these products.
 ​
Under the terms of the Stanford Agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront royalty fee. We are required to pay Stanford low single-digit royalties on all net sales of products that use the licensed technology, as well as a portion of any sublicensing revenues, during the term of the Stanford Agreement and if certain products using the licensed technology are made, used, imported, or offered for sale before the date the Stanford Agreement terminates, and those products are sold after the termination date, we will pay Stanford an earned royalty for our exercise of rights based on the net sales of those products. We are also obligated to pay Stanford annual license maintenance fees, which are fully creditable against any royalty payments made by us for such year. We are also required to provide Stanford with periodic reports documenting our progress toward the development and commercialization of products using the licensed technology. Stanford is responsible under the agreement for preparing, filing and prosecuting patent claims and for maintaining the patents pertaining to the licensed technology.
 ​
Stanford may terminate the agreement in the event that we are materially delinquent on any payment, fail to diligently develop and commercialize a product incorporating the licensed technology, materially miss a milestone under the 

18



agreement, are in material breach of any substantive provision under the agreement, or knowingly provide any false report or are materially delinquent on any report, in each case which is not remedied within the applicable cure period. In addition, if we are not diligently developing and commercializing such a product incorporating the licensed technology, materially miss a milestone or knowingly provide a false report or are delinquent on any report, and we do not cure, the agreement shall not terminate, but it remains subject to termination by Stanford and the license shall convert to a non-exclusive license. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice. Upon termination of the agreement, all rights to the licensed technology revert to Stanford. Our obligation to pay royalties accrued or accruable survives any termination or expiration of the agreement. 

Government Regulation

The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device can be approved for marketing and commercial distribution. In addition, healthcare regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world impose a range of requirements related to paying for medical devices and the procedures in which they are used, including laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of healthcare dollars.
​
U.S. Laws and Regulations

At the federal level, our ultrasound products and certain accessories, such as our charging cable and chargers, are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates product design and development, nonclinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance, authorization or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, packaging and labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. Some of our products are also subject to the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, administered by the FDA, which imposes performance standards and record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements for electronic products that emit radiation, such as x-rays, although diagnostic ultrasound products like ours are subject only to a limited portion of those requirements. A number of U.S. states also impose licensing and compliance regimes on companies that manufacture or distribute prescription devices into or within the state.
 ​
In addition, the commercialization and use of our devices in the United States is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and state agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of payment for health care items and services. Federal laws and regulations apply primarily in connection with government payer programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, but state laws apply more broadly, encompassing health care items and services covered by private payers. At the state and federal level, the government’s interest is in regulating the quality and cost of health care and protecting the independent clinical judgment of licensed healthcare providers.
 ​
The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that any claims made in commerce are consistent with the products’ regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims being made, that the advertising is neither false nor misleading, and that patient or physician testimonials or endorsements we or our agents disseminate comply with disclosure and other regulatory requirements. In general, medical device manufacturers and distributors may not promote or advertise their products for uses not within the scope of a given product’s intended use(s), make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims, or use third parties to make claims about the product that the manufacturer/distributor could not lawfully make itself.
​
FDA Regulation of Medical Devices

The FDA classifies our iQ devices as Class II intermediate-risk medical devices. As required for Class II devices, we received clearance pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA (“510(k)”) for commercial sale of our Butterfly iQ device in 2017, and in 2020 the FDA determined that our Butterfly iQ+ device was eligible to be marketed under the original 510(k) clearance. A premarket notification must demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed 

19



device, known as a predicate device, and in some cases may require submission of clinical data. A predicate device may include a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 for which a PMA is not required (known as a “pre-amendments device” based on the date of enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. A premarket notification is subject to a user fee.
​
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the De Novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. 
​
We are subject to ongoing FDA regulations applicable to commercially marketed devices, including, but not limited to, requirements for maintaining a quality system in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”) and manufacturing our devices in compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices as set forth in the QSR, appropriately labeling of our devices and their packaging, recalling devices that are defective or could be a health risk, reporting to the FDA of actual or potential deaths or serious injuries and certain malfunctions involving our devices and undergoing periodic inspections by the FDA. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue inspectional observations on a Form FDA 483, which identifies instances where the FDA inspector believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures. If the observations are sufficiently serious or the manufacturer fails to respond appropriately, the FDA may issue Warning Letters, which are notices of intended enforcement actions against the manufacturer. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement actions by the FDA such as shutting down our manufacturing operations, requiring us to recall our products, refusing to approve new marketing applications or assessing civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to comply with all applicable FDA regulations.
​
The FDA considers our proprietary software and data transfer service to be a medical device data system (“MDDS”). An MDDS does not require 510(k) clearance, and software that meets the definition of an MDDS is excluded from the definition of “device” under the FDCA and from the regulations applicable to devices.
​
Future products we develop may be classified as Class III high-risk devices, which require a PMA. Applications for a PMA typically require extensive data, including nonclinical and clinical testing data, demonstrating the device’s safety and efficacy for its intended use. FDA conducts an in-depth review of the information submitted in the PMA application and a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with the QSR. Future modifications to our existing devices that could significantly affect their safety or effectiveness or would constitute a major change in their intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance, which may require extensive nonclinical testing. If the modification results in a device being reclassified as a Class III high-risk device, then a PMA application would be required or we may be able to submit a De Novo request for classification if the device is low to moderate risk. The 510(k) clearance, De Novo classification, and PMA application processes can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and could materially affect the timing of future product and/or modification launches.
​
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification or De Novo classification request. In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain institutional review board (“IRB”) approval of the proposed investigation for each clinical site. The IRB reviews the informed consent form and other documents to ensure human subject protection, and is responsible for the continuing review of the clinical study. In addition, if the device presents a “significant risk” (as defined by FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an investigational device exemption (“IDE”) application. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare 

20



of a patient and either is implanted, purported or represented to be used in supporting or sustaining human life, is for a use that is substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise presenting impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of study participants, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE application for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials, including those for non-significant risk devices, must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations, which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements, which include, among other things, recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. Certain clinical trials of devices must be listed on clinicaltrials.gov.
​
U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Compliance Requirements

Successfully commercializing a medical device or technology depends not only on FDA approval, but also on broad health insurance or third-party payor coverage. Government and private payors institute coverage criteria to ensure the appropriate utilization of products and services and to control costs. Limited third party payor coverage for a technology or procedure may limit adoption and commercial viability, while broader coverage supports optimal market uptake. Favorable coverage decisions by government payors like Medicare or Medicaid are critical because private payors typically follow the government’s lead regarding reimbursement. However, manufacturers whose technology is reimbursed by government payors are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. These laws can be implicated by inappropriate sales and marketing arrangements with healthcare providers. Many commonly accepted commercial practices are illegal in the healthcare industry and violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.
Anti-kickback Laws.   The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The HHS — Office of the Inspector General, has issued regulations, commonly known as safe harbors, which set forth certain provisions that, if satisfied in their entirety, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor element may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities or invite litigation by private citizens under federal whistleblower laws. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broadly interpreted and aggressively enforced, with the result that beneficial commercial arrangements can be criminalized in the healthcare industry because of the Anti-Kickback Statute.

The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Federal False Claims Act.   The federal False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim, or the knowing use of false statements or records to obtain payment from the federal government. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,000 and $10,000, with penalties adjusted for inflation annually, 

21



set as of January 30, 2023 at $13,508 to $27,018, for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals (known as “relators” or, more commonly, “whistleblowers”) may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, even before the validity of the claim is established and even if the government decides not to intervene in the lawsuit. Healthcare companies may decide to agree to large settlements with the government and/or whistleblowers to avoid the cost and negative publicity associated with litigation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is possible for knowingly making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.

Federal Physician Self-Referral Law.   The Federal Physician Self-Referral Law (the “Stark Law”) prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, including durable medical equipment and supplies, payable by Medicare, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to the Medicare program for such designated health services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and provides that certain collections related to any such claims must be refunded in a timely manner. Exceptions to the Stark Law include, among other things, exceptions for certain financial relationships, including both ownership and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute: to the extent that the statute is implicated and an exception does not apply, the statute is violated. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have implemented similar physician self-referral prohibitions that may extend to Medicaid, third party payors, and self-pay patients. Violations of the Stark Law must be reported and unauthorized claims must be refunded to Medicare in order to avoid potential liability under the federal False Claims Act for avoiding a known obligation to return identified overpayments. Violations of the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and/or the federal False Claims Act can also form the basis for exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law.   The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (“CMPL”) authorizes the imposition of substantial civil money penalties against an entity that engages in certain prohibited activities including but not limited to violations of the Stark Law or Anti-Kickback Statute, knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim, employment of an excluded individual, and the provision or offer of anything of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the transferring party knows or should know is likely to influence beneficiary selection of a particular provider for which payment may be made in whole or part by a federal health care program, commonly known as the Beneficiary Inducement CMP. Remuneration is defined under the CMPL as any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value. There are certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for offerings that meet the Financial Need, Preventative Care, or Promoting Access to Care exceptions (as defined in the CMPL). Sanctions for violations of the CMPL include civil monetary penalties and administrative penalties up to and including exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
State Analogs of Federal Fraud and Abuse Laws.   Many U.S. states have their own laws intended to protect against fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and more broadly. In some cases these laws prohibit or regulate additional conduct beyond what federal law affects. Penalties for violating these laws can range from fines to criminal sanctions.

HIPAA and Other Privacy Laws and Regulations.   HIPAA created two new federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) and their implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to maintaining the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities and their business associates. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business 

22



associates,” those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, transmit or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
​
HIPAA, as well as a number of other federal and state privacy-related laws, extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information” (“PHI”) under HIPAA. HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare providers who engage in certain standard healthcare transactions electronically, such as electronic billing, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities” under HIPAA. HIPAA requires covered entities to comply with privacy regulations limiting the use and disclosure of PHI (the “Privacy Rule”) and security regulations that require the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information (the “Security Rule”). HIPAA also requires covered entities to provide notification to affected individuals and to the federal government in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI (the “Breach Notification Rule”). Certain provisions of the Privacy Rule and all provisions of the Security Rule apply to “business associates,” or organizations that provide services to covered entities involving the use or disclosure of PHI. Business associates, like us, are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to criminal and civil penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. The HIPAA privacy and security rule impose and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards.

State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, in California, the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) which went into effect on January 1, 2020, establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Further, the CCPA creates a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information of California residents, and this private right of action may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. Currently, clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are exempt from the current version of the CCPA, but possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope. In addition, a new California ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was passed in November 2020. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. Similar laws have been proposed, and likely will be proposed, in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. For example, on March 2, 2021, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) was signed into law. The CDPA becomes effective January 1, 2023, and contains provisions that, in addition to other mandates, require businesses subject to the legislation to conduct data protection assessments in certain circumstances and that require opt-in consent from Virginia consumers to process certain sensitive personal information. 
​
Further data privacy and security laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions may be more stringent than those in the U.S. (such as the European Union (“EU”) which adopted the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018). Analogous state laws may additionally govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect. See “International Laws and Regulations” below.

FCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws.   The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals or organizations in 

23



many countries. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations.

Physician Payments Sunshine Act.    As a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-regulated devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to track and annually report certain payments and other transfers of value that we make to U.S.-licensed physicians (defined broadly to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners) other licensed health care practitioners (i.e. physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse midwives), and U.S. teaching hospitals. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1.15 million per year, with penalties adjusted for inflation annually, for violations of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, depending on the circumstances, and payments reported also have the potential to draw scrutiny on payments to and relationships with physicians, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law and other healthcare laws.

In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states also have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties.

International Laws and Regulations

International marketing and distribution of medical devices are subject to regulation by foreign governments, and such regulations may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain marketing authorization in a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the EU, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.

In the EU, medical devices must be CE marked in order to be marketed. CE marking a device involves working with a notified body (or in some cases, for the lowest risk class devices, the manufacturer can self-certify) to demonstrate that the device meets all applicable requirements of the EU medical devices legislation. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.
​
The EU’s Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC (“MDD”) has been replaced by the EU Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 (“EU MDR”) which became effective on May 26, 2021. The EU MDR was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU MDR, among other things, aims to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices. Unlike the MDD, the EU MDR is directly applicable in all EU Member States without the need for member states to implement the legislation into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.
​
The EU MDR requirements will phase in on a product-by-product basis as certifications issued under the MDD lapse and, as currently implemented, will require all products to undergo review and approval under these new regulations no later than May 26, 2024. However, in response to concerns raised about notified body capacity and the ability for devices to be re-certified within such time period, the European Commission has adopted a proposal to extend the transition period by some years, depending on the risk class of the device. Such proposal is currently being considered for adoption by the 

24



European Parliament and Council. Some of the EU MDR requirements have, however, applied in replacement of the corresponding requirements of the MDD since the EU MDR came into effect, including with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance requirements. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) which consists of the 27 EU Member States plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
​
Outside of the EU, regulatory authorization needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. Some countries have adopted medical device regulatory regimes, such as the Classification Rules for Medical Devices published by the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore regulation of medical devices under the Health Products Act, and Health Canada’s risk classification system for invasive devices, among others. Each country may have its own processes and requirements for medical device licensing, approval/clearance, and regulation, therefore requiring us to seek marketing authorizations on a country-by-country basis.
​
As a result of the United Kingdom (“UK”) leaving the EU, the regulatory framework and regimes for medical devices in the UK and the EU have diverged, as the new EU MDR is not applicable in the UK. In particular, a new UKCA mark was introduced for medical devices placed on the Great Britain market (which includes England, Scotland and Wales). Northern Ireland has adopted a hybrid approach as a result of the divergence in accordance with the Northern Ireland Protocol. Manufacturers can continue placing CE marked medical devices on the Great Britain market for the time being, however from July 1, 2024, transitional arrangements will apply for CE and UKCA marked medical devices placed on the Great Britain market. These transitional arrangements have not yet been brought into force through UK Medical Devices Regulations, but the UK Government intends to introduce legislation by Spring 2023 that will bring these into force.
 ​
Outside the United States, a range of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well as some industry-specific laws and codes of conduct, apply to the medical device industry and interactions with government officials and entities and healthcare professionals. Such laws include, but are not limited to the UK Bribery Act of 2010. Further, the EU Member States have emphasized a greater focus on healthcare fraud and abuse and have indicated greater attention to the industry by the European Anti-Fraud Office. Countries in Asia have also become more active in their enforcement of anti-bribery laws and with respect to procurement and supply chain fraud.
 ​
In the EU, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry. We are subject to, and work to maintain compliance with the GDPR. The GDPR applies across the EU and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company’s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of EU-based data subjects, including: providing disclosures about how their personal data will be used; high standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; rights for individuals to have access to their personal data, to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability; the principle of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as “special category” data under the GDPR and are afforded greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. Companies subject to the GDPR must allocate substantial legal costs to the development of necessary policies and procedures and overall compliance efforts. We expect to incur continued costs associated with maintaining compliance with GDPR into the future.
​
We will also be subject to evolving EU laws on data export, where we transfer data outside the EU to ourselves, group companies or third parties. The GDPR only permits exports of data outside the EU to jurisdictions that ensure an adequate level of data protection. The United States has not been deemed to offer an adequate level of protection, so in order for us to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States, we must implement a valid transfer mechanism (e.g., the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses). On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU, or CJEU, issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18), or Schrems II. This decision invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield on which many companies had relied as an acceptable mechanism for transferring 

25



such data from the EU to the United States. In the same decision, the CJEU deemed that the Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, published by the EU Commission are valid. However, the CJEU ruled that transfers made pursuant to the SCCs need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis to ensure the law in the recipient country provides “essentially equivalent” protections to safeguard the transferred personal data as the EU, and required businesses to adopt supplementary measures if such standard is not met. On June 4, 2021, the EU Commission issued new SCCs that account for the CJEU’s decision and other developments. Consequently, it is an ongoing challenge for data importers like us to identify compliant methods of data transfers necessary for their businesses. There is some risk of data transfers from the EU being halted.
 ​
Moreover, the UK leaving the EU could lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. Further to the UK’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR into UK law (the “UK GDPR”). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is currently in line with the GDPR. The UK has announced plans to reform the country’s data protection legal framework in its Data Reform Bill, but these have been put on hold. There may be further divergence in the future, including with regard to administrative burdens. This may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk exposure as we may no longer be able to take a unified approach across the EU and the UK. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. 
​
Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the GDPR, the EU Commission has issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EU remain free flowing. The new SCCs do not apply to the UK, but the UK Information Commissioner’s Office has published its own transfer mechanism, the International Data Transfer Agreement (“UK IDTA”), which entered into force on 21 March 2022, and enables data transfers originating from the UK. It requires a similar assessment of the data protection provided in the importer’s country.
