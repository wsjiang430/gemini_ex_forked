ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview

Corporate Vision: Our core mission is to transform women’s gynecologic health through the development of technology-enabled diagnostic tools, starting with ovarian cancer. We aim to eradicate late-stage detection of ovarian cancer and to ensure that our solutions will meet the needs of women of all ages, races, ethnicities and stages of the disease. 

Our plan is to broaden our focus to the differential diagnoses of other gynecologic diseases that typically cannot be assessed through traditional non-invasive clinical procedures. We expect to continue commercializing our existing and new technology and to distribute our tests through our decentralized technology transfer service platform, Aspira Synergy. We also intend to continue to raise public awareness regarding the diagnostic superiority of Ova1 as compared to cancer antigen 125 (“CA125”) on its own for all women, but especially for racially diverse women with adnexal masses, as well as the superior performance of machine learning algorithms in detecting ovarian cancer in different racial and ethnic populations. We plan to continue to expand access to our tests among Medicaid patients as part of our corporate mission to make the best care available to all women, and we plan to advocate for legislation and the adoption of our technology in professional society guidelines to provide broad access to our products and services. 

Throughout 2022, we have focused on three key initiatives: growth, innovation, and operational excellence: 
Growth. In 2022, we have continued to grow Ova1Plus product volume and revenue through our commercial team. Throughout the year, we aimed not only to increase the number of physicians ordering for the first time but also to increase repeat orders from existing physician customers. Positive trends in the tenure of our sales professionals have led to year-over-year volume growth. In addition, in October 2022, we launched a co-marketing and distribution collaboration with BioReference Health, LLC (formerly known as BioReference Laboratories, Inc.), a subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc. (“BRL”), as a new channel for volume growth. Also in the fourth quarter, we announced that the American Medical Association assigned a new Proprietary Laboratory Assay code for OvaWatch, which will enable payers to identify OvaWatch specifically in the claims adjudication process beginning in April 2023. In addition, the Federal Omnibus bill passed by Congress in December 2022 mandates coverage for multi-marker testing for ovarian cancer, such as Ova1Plus and OvaWatch via a National Coverage Determination within 180 days of the bill’s effective date. The Company secured credentialing or pricing for Medicaid and Managed Medicaid population in many new states in 2022.
Innovation. Innovation is fundamental to the long-term success of any diagnostics company. For Aspira, it starts with the expansion of our ovarian cancer portfolio, which is now branded as OvaSuite. Our first Lab Developed Test (“LDT”), OvaWatch, is a non-invasive ovarian cancer risk assessment for women with adnexal masses to be used by physicians as part of initial clinical assessment. This assay will significantly expand our patient population beyond the population that existed for Ova1Plus. OvaWatch was designed to be launched in two phases. The first phase, a one-time use test for initial clinical assessment, was launched in the fourth quarter of 2022. We intend to launch the second phase, which will be used for serial mass monitoring, in 2023. In 2022, the Company published two OvaWatch manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals: "Analytical Validation of a Deep Neural Network Algorithm for the Detection of Ovarian Cancer," published online in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Clinical Cancer Informatics and “Validation of Deep Neural Network-based Algorithm Supporting Clinical Management of Adnexal Mass,” published in the high impact journal, Frontiers in Medicine.
We plan to accelerate the development of our endometriosis product portfolio by supplementing our internal development and validation program with our partnership with Harvard’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (“DFCI”), Brigham & Women’s Hospital (“BWH”), and Medical University of Lodz through a sponsored research agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of 2022. We are committed to launching a first-generation non-invasive endometriosis diagnostic tool in the second half of 2023. 
We believe the Company’s competitive positioning is superior to other diagnostic companies as our processes to develop and validate new LDTs are performed in a CLIA laboratory environment. This allows for the acceleration of assay commercialization without sacrificing patient care.


 
Operational Excellence. We achieved our cash utilization goals for 2022 by focusing on spending that accelerates innovation and growth. We plan to maintain the right employee talent and scale to achieve our goals and drive efficiencies in 2023. 

Mission Statement: Our core mission is to transform women’s gynecologic health through the development of technology-enabled diagnostic tools, starting with ovarian cancer. We aim to eradicate late-stage detection of ovarian cancer and to ensure that our solutions will meet the needs of women of all ages, races, ethnicities and stages of the disease. 

Scientific Bases for Our Products: 
Science of Biomarkers: Our focus on translational biomarkers and informatics enables us to address the market for novel diagnostic tests that simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers. A biomarker is a biomolecule or variant biomolecule (e.g., DNA, RNA or protein) that is present at measurably greater or lesser concentrations, or is present in an altered form, in a disease state versus a normal condition. Conventional protein tests measure a single protein biomarker whereas most diseases are complex. We believe cancer and other complex diseases are heterogeneous at the causative level (i.e., most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies) and at the human response level (i.e., each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner). 

Consequently, measuring a single biomarker when multiple biomarkers may be altered in a complex disease is unlikely to provide meaningful information about the disease state. 

We believe that our approach of monitoring and combining multiple biomarkers using a variety of analytical techniques has allowed and will continue to allow us to create diagnostic tools that provide information about the disease state with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to aid the physician considering treatment options for patients with complex diseases. Such assays are sometimes referred to as Multivariate Index Assays (“MIAs”) and often utilize advanced algorithms based on logistic regression, pattern recognition and the like. Often, MIA algorithms are non-intuitive, and therefore require rigorous clinical validation and error modeling. Aspira and its collaborators are considered experts in these areas and, in the case of Ova1 and Overa, presented both the clinical validation and error modeling needed to gain pre-market authorization from the FDA. In the case of Ova1, the FDA granted a request for de novo classification of an ovarian adnexal mass assessment score test system, a type of in vitro diagnostic device; in the case of Overa (previously Ova1 Next Generation), FDA granted a 510(k) clearance.

Our Business and Products: We currently market and sell the following products and related services: (1) Ova1, a blood test intended as an aid to further assess the likelihood of malignancy in women with an ovarian adnexal mass for which surgery is planned when the physician’s independent clinical and radiological evaluation does not indicate malignancy; (2) Overa, a second-generation biomarker reflex test intended to maintain Ova1’s high sensitivity while improving specificity; (3) Ova1Plus, a reflex offering which uses Ova1 as the primary test and Overa as a confirmation for Ova1 intermediate range results and leverages the strengths of Ova1’s multivariate index assay (“MIA”) sensitivity and Overa’s (MIA2G) specificity and as a result reduces false elevations by over 40%; and (4) OvaWatch, a lab developed blood test intended to assist in the initial clinical assessment of malignancy risk in all women thought to have an indeterminate or benign adnexal mass. Collectively, these tests are referred to and marketed as OvaSuite. Our products are distributed through our own national sales force, through our proprietary decentralized testing platform and cloud service marketed as Aspira Synergy, and through a marketing and distribution agreement with BioReference Health, LLC (formerly known as BioReference Laboratories, Inc.), a subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc.

Our Ova1 test received FDA de novo classification in September 2009. Ova1 comprises instruments, assays, reagents, and the OvaCalc software, which includes a proprietary algorithm that produces a risk score. Our Overa test, which includes an updated version of OvaCalc, received FDA 510(k) clearance in March 2016. Ova1, Overa and OvaWatch, our first LDT, each use the Roche Cobas 4000, 6000 and 8000 platforms for analysis of proteins. Revenue from these sources (in addition to revenue from Aspira GenetiX, which was discontinued in September 2022) is included in the results of operations in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In 2021, we began entering into decentralized arrangements with large healthcare networks and physician practices for our Aspira Synergy platform, our decentralized testing platform and cloud service for decentralized global access of protein biomarker testing. Ova1, Overa, and Ova1Plus continue to be available through the Aspira Synergy platform. We have entered into four technology transfer agreements since the launch of Aspira Synergy. Two of the agreements are with independent regional laboratories and are in the process of being launched and piloted. One of the agreements is with one of the nation’s largest and leading independent women’s healthcare groups which has already launched and is contributing to our Ova1Plus volume. The last of the four agreements with Axia Women’s Health, which had been intended to deliver genetics carrier screening, was cancelled by the customer in the third quarter of 2022. This cancellation, along with the general deterioration of commercial opportunities in the genetics carrier screening market, has led us to cease providing Aspira GenetiX, including 

 
genetics carrier screening, on our Aspira Synergy platform, effective as of September 30, 2022. This did not have a material impact on our revenues in 2022, nor do we expect it to have a material impact in any future periods. 

OvaWatch has been developed and is validated for use in Aspira’s CLIA-certified lab as a non-invasive blood-based risk assessment test for use in conjunction with clinical assessment and imaging to determine ovarian cancer risk for patients with an adnexal mass whose adnexal mass has been determined by an initial clinical assessment as indeterminate or benign. The commercialization plan for OvaWatch will occur in two phases. Phase I, which was launched during the fourth quarter of 2022, is a single use, point-in-time risk assessment test and Phase II will allow for serial monitoring. The launch of the serial monitoring test is targeted for the second half of 2023 following the expected publication of data from the ongoing prospective serial monitoring clinical study. We believe OvaWatch has the potential to significantly expand the addressable market compared to Ova1Plus.

Outside of the United States, we have sponsored studies in both the Philippines and Israel, which are intended to validate Overa and Ova1 in specific populations. In June 2022, a manuscript arising from clinical research efforts in the Philippines, which we sponsored, was accepted for publication in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. The Philippines study is the first application of Aspira Synergy for Overa specimen testing. The first paper from the Philippines study was published in the third quarter of 2022.

We own and operate Aspira Labs, based in Austin, Texas, a Clinical Chemistry and Endocrinology Laboratory accredited by the College of American Pathologists, which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies to address critical needs in the management of gynecologic cancers and disease. Aspira Labs provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based risk assessment to aid in clinical decision making and advance personalized treatment plans. The lab currently performs our Ova1, Overa, Ova1Plus, and OvaWatch testing as well as additional tumour and hormone tests, and we plan to expand the testing to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need. Aspira Labs holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a supplier number to Aspira Labs in 2015. Aspira labs also hold a current ISO 13485 certification which is the most accepted standard worldwide for medical device.

In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies, government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, a Medicare contractor, covers and reimburses for Ova1 tests performed in certain states, including Texas. Due to Ova1 tests billed by the Company being performed exclusively at Aspira Labs in Texas, the local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. Aspira Labs also bills third-party commercial and other government payers as well as client bill accounts and patients for Ova1.

In November 2016, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (“ACOG”) issued Practice Bulletin Number 174 which included Ova1, defined as the “Multivariate Index Assay”, outlining ACOG’s clinical management guidelines for adnexal mass management. Practice Bulletin Number 174 recommends that obstetricians and gynecologists evaluating women with adnexal masses who do not meet Level A criteria of a low-risk transvaginal ultrasound should proceed with Level B clinical guidelines. Level B guidelines state that the physician may use risk assessment tools such as existing CA-125 technology or Ova1 (“Multivariate Index Assay”) as listed in the bulletin. Based on this, Ova1 achieved parity with CA-125 as a Level B clinical recommendation for the management of adnexal masses.

Practice Bulletins summarize current information on techniques and clinical management issues for the practice of obstetrics and gynecology. Practice Bulletins are evidence-based documents, and recommendations are based on the evidence. This is also the only clinical management tool used for adnexal masses. Although there are Practice Bulletins, guidelines do not exist for adnexal masses. ACOG guidelines do exist, however, for ovarian cancer management. 

Product Pipeline

We are well positioned to introduce new gynecologic diagnostic products and we plan to expand our product offerings to additional women’s gynecologic health diseases by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, genetics, other modalities (e.g., imaging), clinical risk factors and patient data to aid diagnosis and risk stratification. Future product expansions will be accelerated by the development of lab developed testing in a CLIA environment, or relationships with strategic research and development partners, and access to specimens in our biobank. 

About OvaWatch serial testing: OvaWatch is a non-invasive blood-based risk assessment test to determine ovarian cancer risk for patients with an adnexal mass whose adnexal mass has been determined by an initial clinical assessment as indeterminate or benign. OvaWatch is designed to support a physician’s planned clinical management through additional clinical 

 
data at the time of initial assessment, and by potentially monitoring - in conjunction with ultrasounds and other clinical assessments – to safely decrease or delay unnecessary surgery. 

The test was developed through a rigorous scientific and clinical-based process and validated in a CLIA environment utilizing large retrospective cohorts of over 3,000 patients and multi-site prospective clinical studies. OvaWatch technology was validated for this application in two separate prospective cohorts of women. The first cohort was patients with an identified pelvic mass and symptoms. The second cohort was women whose pelvic mass is found incidentally and are asymptomatic, and that are also not scheduled for surgery. 

OvaWatch was designed for launch in two stages. Phase I, which was launched during the fourth quarter of 2022 is a single use point in time test, and Phase II will allow for serial monitoring. The launch of the serial monitoring test is targeted for 2023 upon obtaining sufficient data from the ongoing prospective serial monitoring clinical study. Phase I of the OvaWatch test has a 99% negative predictive value, which will allow physicians to initially assess and serially monitor women with a mass to safely delay or reduce premature or unnecessary surgery. 

In 2022, we published two OvaWatch manuscripts: "Analytical Validation of a Deep Neural Network Algorithm for the Detection of Ovarian Cancer," published online in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Clinical Cancer Informatics; and “Validation of Deep Neural Network-based Algorithm Supporting Clinical Management of Adnexal Mass,” published in the high impact, peer-reviewed journal, Frontiers in Medicine.

About Endocheck: EndoCheck, an in-development non-invasive blood test to be used in conjunction with other non-surgical modalities, is designed as an aid in the identification of endometriosis to guide clinical care for patients with suspected endometriosis earlier in their prognosis journey. Current detection methods for endometriosis require surgery and a surgical biopsy diagnosis and/or visualization diagnosis. EndoCheck is intended to address this large patient population by using a non-invasive solution with comparable sensitivity and specificity when compared to invasive methods such as surgical biopsy and/or visualization. We expect that our research collaboration agreement with DFCI, BWH, and Medical University of Lodz will accelerate commercialization of our endometriosis product portfolio. Our goal is to launch an EndoCheck LDT in the second half of 2023.

We ultimately plan to commercialize OvaSuite and EndoCheck on a global scale and hold CE marks for Ova1 and Overa. In June 2022, in connection with our global expansion plans, a manuscript arising from clinical research efforts in the Philippines, which we sponsored, was accepted for publication in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. The study was designed to validate the effectiveness of a multivariate index assay (“MIA2G”) Overa in the assessment of ovarian cancer in Filipino women. The resulting data indicated that MIA2G (Overa) exhibited better overall performance in detecting ovarian cancer, regardless of menopausal status, compared to CA-125 test measures. Notably, MIA2G (Overa) was shown to be more sensitive in detecting early-stage disease for this population than CA-125. The study also showed that MIA2G (Overa) had the best overall performance of all individual classifiers, including in some of the most difficult to detect cancers cohorts such as premenopausal women, and early-stage disease.

Studies and Publications
On June 16, 2022, we announced the online publication of a paper entitled “Analytical Validation of a Deep Neural Network Algorithm for the Detection of Ovarian Cancer,” in the June issue of JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics. The paper validates the OvaWatch algorithm in the detection of ovarian cancer and demonstrates the potential of OvaWatch in assessing the risk of ovarian malignancy in patients with pelvic masses, which are indeterminate or benign.
On September 12, 2022, we announced publication of a study, “Clinical Performance of a Multivariate Index Assay in Detecting Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer in Filipino Women,” in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. The study concluded that incorporating MIA2G (OVERA) rather than CA-125 into clinical assessment would increase the detection of early-stage ovarian cancers, regardless of menopausal status.
On January 6, 2023, we announced a manuscript, “Validation of Deep Neural Network-based Algorithm Supporting Clinical Management of Adnexal Mass,” had been published in the prestigious and high impact, peer-reviewed journal, Frontiers in Medicine. The paper presents findings from the multi-site clinical study of the company’s new assay, OvaWatch, describing real-world evidence supporting the use of OvaWatch for the clinical management of adnexal masses.
The Company has a number of ongoing clinical studies to support the development of our product pipeline. In addition to our ongoing clinical study for the validation of serial monitoring using the OvaWatch mass monitoring test, in 2022 we launched a study to support the validation of our to-be-launched EndoCheck test. The goal of this observational study is to determine the clinical validity of a machine learning based algorithm that utilizes protein biomarker to detect Endometriosis - "EndoCheck" - as an additional diagnostic assessment tool for endometriosis. We also support ongoing ex-U.S. studies in the Philippines and Israel. ‎

The Diagnostic Field
The economics of healthcare demand effective and efficient allocation of resources which can be accomplished through disease prevention, early detection of disease leading to early intervention, and diagnostic tools that can triage patients to more appropriate therapy and intervention. In 2022, Fortune Business Insight, a market research and business consulting partnership, published a study which forecasts the global in vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) market to reach $107.42 billion by 2029, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 6% from 2022 to 2029. We have chosen to concentrate our business focus in the areas of oncology and women’s health where we have established strong key opinion leaders, and provider and patient relationships. Demographic trends suggest that, as the population ages, the burden from gynecologic diseases, including cancers, will increase and the demand for quality diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests will escalate. In addition, the areas of oncology and women’s health generally lack quality diagnostic tests and, therefore, we believe patient outcomes can be significantly improved by the development of novel diagnostic tests. Furthermore, an increasing number of women are becoming aware of the importance of early detection, particularly in gynecologic diseases.

Ovarian Cancer

Background

Commonly known as the “silent killer,” ovarian cancer leads to nearly 13,000 deaths each year in the United States. In 2022, The American Cancer Society (“ACS”) estimated that nearly 20,000 new ovarian cancer cases were diagnosed, with the majority of patients diagnosed in the late stages of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the ovary. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer patients in the late stages of the disease have a poor prognosis, which leads to high mortality rates. According to the National Cancer Institute, when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at its earliest stage (stage 1), patients have up to a 93%, 5-year survival rate following surgery and/or chemotherapy. The 5-year survival rate falls to as low as 31% for ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in the late-stages of the disease. 

While the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in its earliest stages greatly increases the likelihood of long-term survival from the disease, another factor that predicts clinical outcomes from ovarian cancer is the specialized training of the surgeon who operates on the ovarian cancer patient. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of malignant ovarian tumors by specialists such as gynecologic oncologists coupled with specialist medical centers improves outcomes for women with these tumors. Published guidelines from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (“SGO”) and the ACOG recommends referral of women with malignant ovarian tumors to specialists. Accordingly, there is a clinical need for a diagnostic test that can provide adequate predictive value to stratify patients with a pelvic mass into those with a high-risk of invasive ovarian cancer versus those with a low-risk of ovarian cancer, which is essential for improving overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer. The goal is to catch the mass early before it becomes late-stage cancer.

Although adnexal masses are relatively common, malignant tumors are less so. Screening studies have indicated that the prevalence of simple ovarian cysts in women 55 years of age and older can be as high as 14%.[1] Adnexal masses are thought to be even more common in premenopausal women, but there are more non-persistent, physiologic ovarian masses in this demographic group. For instance, in the University of Kentucky ovarian cancer screening project, the rate of postmenopausal women with persistently abnormal ultrasound findings requiring surgery was 1.4%.[2] According to 2010 U.S. census data, there are 36.8 million women between the ages of 50 and 70 in the U.S., suggesting that there are more than 500,000 suspicious adnexal masses in this segment alone. When managing an adnexal mass, physicians will either take a surgical management approach or a clinical management approach. Patients that do require surgical management could potentially benefit from the use of Ova1Plus. Patients not referred for surgical intervention may benefit from the use of OvaWatch to confirm the low risk of malignancy of a mass that was determined to be indeterminate or benign by initial clinical assessment. 

The ACOG Ovarian Cancer Guidelines and the SGO guidelines help physicians evaluate adnexal masses for malignancy. These guidelines take into account menopausal status, CA125 levels, and physical and imaging findings. However, these guidelines have notable shortcomings because of their reliance on diagnostics with certain weaknesses. Most notably, the CA125 blood test, which is cleared by the FDA for the monitoring for recurrence of ovarian cancer only, is negative in up to 31% of early-stage ovarian cancer cases.[3] Moreover, CA125 can be elevated in numerous conditions and diseases other than ovarian cancer, including menstruation, benign ovarian masses, liver disease, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy and uterine fibroids. 

These shortcomings limit the CA125 blood test’s utility in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors or for use in detection of early-stage ovarian cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound is another diagnostic modality used with patients with ovarian masses. Attempts at defining specific morphological criteria that can aid in a benign versus malignant diagnosis have led to the morphology index and the risk of malignancy index, with reports of 40-70% predictive value. However, ultrasound interpretation can be variable and dependent on the experience of the operator. Accordingly, the ACOG and SGO guidelines perform only modestly in identifying early-stage ovarian cancer and malignancy in pre-menopausal women. Efforts to improve detection of cancer by lowering the cutoff for CA125 (the “Modified ACOG/SGO Guidelines”) provide only a modest benefit, since CA125 is absent in about 20% of epithelial ovarian cancer cases and is poorly detected in early-stage ovarian cancer overall.

In November 2016, ACOG practice bulletin 174 (November 2016) states the following regarding our Ova1-branded product “The multivariate index assay has demonstrated higher sensitivity and negative predictive value for ovarian malignancy when compared with clinical impression and CA 125 alone.”[4]

The ovarian cancer information page on American Cancer Society’s website indicates that:

For women who have an ovarian tumor, a test called Ova1 can measure the levels of 5 proteins in the blood. The levels of these proteins, when looked at together, are used to determine whether a woman’s tumor should be considered low-risk or high-risk. If the tumor is labeled ‘low-risk’ based on this test, the woman is not likely to have cancer. If the tumor is considered ‘high-risk,’ the woman is more likely to have a cancer and should see a specialist (a gynecologic oncologist). 

 
This test is NOT a screening test and it is NOT a test to decide if you should have surgery or not− it is meant for women who have an ovarian tumor where surgery has been decided but have not yet been referred to a gynecologic oncologist.[5]

Aspira is committed to developing diagnostic tools for women of all ages, races and ethnicities. In 2019, two studies were released indicating superior clinical performance of Ova1 over CA125 and Ova1 over CA125, HE4 and Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (“ROMA”) in African American women.[6][7] In 2022, another study was released indicating superior clinical performance of Ova1 over CA125 in Filipino women.[8]

Commercialization and Distribution

The Company markets and distributes its products through 1) a national sales team, 2) the Aspira Synergy cloud-based technology transfer platform, and 3) various commercial partnerships. In October 2022, we launched a co-marketing and distribution collaboration with BioReference Health, LLC (formerly known as BioReference Laboratories, Inc.), a subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc. (“BRL”), as a new channel for volume growth. Under terms of the agreement, the Aspira and BioReference sales teams will collaborate to sell Ova1Plus to gynecologists and other women’s healthcare providers nationwide.

Starting in 2014, we offered Ova1 via Aspira Labs. In March 2015, we entered into a commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics. Pursuant to this agreement, all Ova1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Aspira’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Aspira Labs. Pursuant to this agreement as subsequently amended, Quest Diagnostics has continued to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens from its clients to Aspira Labs for testing in exchange for a market value fee. Per the terms of the agreement, we may not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers any tests that Quest Diagnostics offers. 

We have active international distribution agreements for Overa with Pro-Genetics LTD in Israel and MacroHealth, Inc. in the Philippines.

Customers

In the United States, our clinical customer base can be segmented into four major groups: physicians (including women’s care super-groups), physician office laboratories and national and regional laboratories. Both within and outside the United States, our customer specimens are sent directly to us, and we bill either through payer contracts or client bill arrangements. We also offer access to our Ova1 and Overa assays via our decentralized technology transfer relationships established between us and authorized distributors. 
Research and Development

Our research and development efforts center on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and the combinations of biomarkers with other “omics” that can be developed into diagnostic assays. We have done this predominantly through collaborations we have established with academic institutions such as the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the 

 
University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Harvard’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham & Women’s Hospital and Medical University of Lodz. In addition, we actively seek collaborations and initiate dialog with clinical academics and other organizations, in order to generate publications, intellectual property or test development in broader areas of gynecologic oncology and other gynecologic diseases. 

Our research and development efforts are detailed in the “Product Pipeline” section above.

In 2019, two studies identified a disparity in diagnosis for African American women and demonstrated that Ova1 has superior sensitivity for detection in this population over CA125 or ROMA. In 2022, another study demonstrated the superiority of Overa over CA125 in Filipino women.

In 2022 and early 2023, two OvaWatch peer-reviewed validations were published. The first, “Analytical Validation of a Deep Neural Network Algorithm for the Detection of Ovarian Cancer,” validates the OvaWatch algorithm in the detection of ovarian cancer and demonstrates the potential of OvaWatch in accurately assessing the risk of ovarian malignancy in patients with pelvic masses. Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic cancer, with most cases being diagnosed at late stage. Early detection of ovarian cancer is key to helping to reduce mortality; however, other current non-invasive risk assessment measures on the market vary in their usefulness. The other paper, “Validation of Deep Neural Network-based Algorithm Supporting Clinical Management of Adnexal Mass,” presents findings from the multi-site clinical study of the Company’s new assay, OvaWatch, describing real-world evidence supporting the use of OvaWatch for the clinical management of adnexal masses.

Commercial Operations

We have a commercial infrastructure, including sales and marketing and reimbursement expertise. We also operate a national CLIA certified clinical laboratory, Aspira Labs. Our sales representatives work to identify opportunities for educating general gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists on the benefits of Ova1. In February 2015, Aspira received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world’s leading certification bodies. We currently hold CE marks for Ova1 and Overa. We are targeting markets outside of the United States now that we have Overa cleared on the Roche cobas platform, which is available globally. 

Approximately 21,423 OvaSuite tests, inclusive of OvaWatch, were performed in 2022 compared to 17,377 in 2021, which included only Ova1Plus tests. In 2022, we continued to increase sales through Market Development Managers. As awareness of our product continues to build, these representatives are focused on efforts that will have a positive impact on regional payers and create positive payer coverage decisions. They are working with local key opinion leaders and meeting with medical directors to discuss the clinical need, our technology solutions package and increasing patient experience and cases studies showing the positive outcomes utilizing Ova1, Overa and Ova1Plus. 

Aspira Women’s Health successfully launched a comarketing arrangement for Ova1Plus with BioReference Laboratories on October 5, 2022. Under terms of the agreement, the Aspira and BioReference sales teams will collaborate to sell Ova1Plus to gynecologists and other women’s healthcare providers nationwide.

We believe OvaWatch will have a significant impact on the ordering behavior of physicians with respect to our ovarian cancer blood tests. Unlike Ova1Plus, which is indicated for use only for women with adnexal masses that have been identified for surgery, OvaWatch was developed for use with women with adnexal masses that have been identified as either benign or indeterminate through initial clinical assessment. It is estimated that physicians see three or more times as many women with benign or indeterminate masses compared to women with masses that are planned for surgery. In addition, we believe that the OvaWatch serial monitoring test that is planned for commercial launch in the second half of 2023 will further expand the patient population and the ordering frequency of our ovarian cancer blood tests.

Revenue and Reimbursement

In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies, government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, client bill accounts and patients. Novitas Solutions, a Medicare contractor, covers and reimburses for Ova1 tests performed in certain states, including Texas. Due to Ova1 tests being performed at Aspira Labs in Texas, this local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. Aspira Labs also bills third-party commercial and other government payers as well as client bill accounts and patients for Ova1. Through December 31, 2022, Aspira’s product and related services revenue has primarily been limited to revenue generated by sales of Ova1Plus and Aspira GenetiX (discontinued in September 2022) and OvaWatch (launched in December 2022) generating minimal revenue throughout 2021 and 2022.


In December 2013, the CMS made its final determination and authorized Medicare contractors to set prices for Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses (“MAAA”) test CPT codes when they determine it is payable. In late 2016, Ova1 was included on the list of clinical diagnostic laboratory test procedure codes as one for which the CMS would require reporting of private payer rates as part of the implementation of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”). In November 2017, we announced that the CMS released the Final 2018 Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (“CLFS”), effective January 1, 2018. Under the new fee schedule, the price for Ova1(MIA) (code 81503) is $897. This is a four-fold increase over the previous CMS rate, and this new rate was based on the median of private payer payments submitted to CMS by companies, including Aspira Labs, as part of the market-based payment reform mandated through PAMA. The rate was scheduled to be in effect for a three-year term from January 2018 through December 2020. This rate is now extended through 2023. There are no assurances that reimbursement rates will not be changed after 2023. 

CMS announced in 2022 that it would delay the period during which rates would be evaluated for another year. Therefore, the company will not be responsible for providing reimbursement rates until 2024.

Despite gains in positive medical policy coverage and contract agreements, insurance coverage and patient bills remain a concern to the physician and can disrupt the ordering pattern of a provider who is supportive of our products. We have instituted a “Patient Transparency Program” to assist with this process by proactively assessing insurance and educating patients on testing costs prior to testing being performed. The United States Congress included a provision in the 2023 Omnibus Spending Bill that called for the national Medicare coverage of multi-marker blood tests for ovarian cancer within 180 days. If this provision results in a National Coverage Determination, we believe this could further expand coverage and drive adoption. 

In 2022, we added 7 new credentialed Medicaid states, which brought the total number of covered lives to approximately 215 million as of December 31, 2022, representing approximately 60% of the lives in the U.S.

We have a comprehensive reimbursement plan for OvaWatch, including a local coverage determination reconsideration request to Novitas to replicate the coverage policy for Ova1. In addition, we have secured a PLA code from the AMA that distinguishes OvaWatch from all other available testing. In February 2023, the Company signed a contract with a major global commercial payer which provides for patient coverage for OvaWatch beginning in April 2023.

Competition

The diagnostics industry in which we operate is competitive and evolving. There is intense competition among healthcare, biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover candidates for potential new diagnostic products. These companies may: 

develop new diagnostic products in advance of us or our collaborators; 
develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost-effective than those developed by us or our collaborators; 
obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their diagnostic products more rapidly than us or our collaborators; or 
obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our or our collaborators’ ability to develop and commercialize, or a customers’ ability to use our or our collaborators’ diagnostic products. 

We compete with companies in the United States and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of novel biomarkers that may form the basis of novel diagnostic tests. These companies may develop products that are competitive with and/or perform the same or similar functions as the products offered by us or our collaborators, such as biomarker specific reagents or diagnostic test kits. Also, clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by us or our collaborators. For example, a clinical laboratory can either use reagents purchased from manufacturers other than us or use its own internally developed reagents to make diagnostic tests. If clinical laboratories make tests in this manner for a particular disease, they could offer testing services for that disease as an alternative to products sold by us used to test for the same disease. The testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic test kits.

Fujirebio Diagnostics sells ROMA. ROMA combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm. This test has the same intended use and precautions as Ova1. ROMA is currently marketed as having utility limited to epithelial ovarian cancers, which accounts for 80% of ovarian malignancies. Based upon the results of studies done in 2013 and 2019, we believe that Ova1 has superior performance when compared to the Fujirebio Diagnostics test.

In addition, competitors such as Abbott Laboratories, Angle, Anixa, AOA, Becton Dickinson, Exact Sciences (Thrive), Grail and InterVenn have publicly disclosed that they have been or are currently working on ovarian cancer diagnostic assays. Academic institutions periodically report new findings in ovarian cancer diagnostics that may have commercial value. 

 


A number of diagnostic and academic organizations have announced plans or published studies related to the development of a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the identification of endometriosis. If successful, the product may be competitive with our to-be-launched EndoCheck LDT. Competitors include, but are not limited to, Dot.Labs, Ziwig, and Endodiag. We believe our experience developing multi-biomarker assays, particularly those focused on gynecologic diseases and pelvic masses, as well as our experienced women’s health field sales team and our focus on developing a clinical assay in our CLIA laboratory environment, is a significant competitive advantage. We also believe that our biobank is another significant advantage.

Intellectual Property Protection 

Our intellectual property includes federally registered trademarks and service marks as well as federally pending trademark and service mark applications for our product and service offerings, and a portfolio of owned, co-owned or licensed patents and patent applications. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our clinical diagnostics patent portfolio included 20 issued United States patents, 12 pending United States patent applications and numerous pending patent applications and issued patents outside the United States. These patents and patent applications are directed to diagnostic technologies.
Manufacturing

We are the manufacturer of FDA cleared products Ova1 and Overa as well as a lab-developed test, OvaWatch. The component assays use purchased reagents. Because we do not directly manufacture the component assays, we are required to maintain supply agreements with manufacturers of each of the assays. As part of our quality systems, reagent lots for these assays are tested to ensure they meet specifications required for inclusion. Only reagent lots determined by us as having met these specifications are permitted for use in our testing. Our principal supplier is Roche Diagnostics Corporation. Our standard practice is to have at least four months of reagents on hand at any time.
Environmental Matters

Medical Waste
We are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste as well as relating to the safety and health of laboratory employees. Aspira Labs is operated in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to disposal of all laboratory specimens. We utilize outside vendors for disposal of specimens. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to fines, penalties and damages claims in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use, or the use by third parties, of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.
Occupational Safety
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals and transmission of the blood-borne and airborne pathogens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.
Specimen Transportation
Regulations of the Department of Transportation, the International Air Transportation Agency, the Public Health Service and the Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens. Although we believe that we 

 
have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.

Government Regulation 

FDA Regulation of Medical Devices 
In the U.S., medical devices, including IVD products (“IVDs”), are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDC Act”), and its implementing regulations, and certain other federal and state statutes and regulations. The laws and regulations govern, among other things, the design, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion, post-approval monitoring and reporting, distribution and import and export of medical devices, including IVDs. IVDs are a type of medical device and include reagents and instruments used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases or conditions. Predictive, prognostic, and screening tests can also be IVDs. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a device and/or its manufacturer to a variety of administrative and judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending pre-market approval applications (“PMAs”) or other applications, issuance of warning letters or untitled letters, mandatory product recalls, import detentions, civil monetary penalties, and/or judicial sanctions, such as product seizures, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.
The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are deemed to be low risk and are subject only to the general regulatory controls. Class II devices are moderate risk. They are subject to general controls and may also be subject to special controls. Class III devices are generally the highest risk devices. They are required to obtain premarket approval and comply with post-market conditions of approval in addition to general regulatory controls. 
Generally, establishments that design and/or manufacture devices are required to register their establishments with the FDA. They also must provide the FDA with a list of the devices that they design and/or manufacture at their facilities.
The FDA enforces its requirements by market surveillance and periodic visits, both announced and unannounced, to inspect or re-inspect equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes to confirm regulatory compliance. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors that are device manufacturers. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a report, known as a Form 483, listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or, if observed violations are sufficiently serious, a warning letter. If the manufacturer does not adequately respond to a Form 483 or warning letter, the FDA make take enforcement action against the manufacturer or impose other sanctions or consequences, which may include:
cease and desist orders;
injunctions or consent decrees;
civil monetary penalties;
recall, detention or seizure of products;
operating restrictions or partial or total shutdown of production facilities;
refusal of or delay in granting requests for 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or premarket approval of new products or modified products;
withdrawing 510(k) clearances, de novo classifications, or premarket approvals that are already granted;
refusal to grant export approval or export certificates for devices; and
criminal prosecution.
Pre-Market Authorization and Notification
Unless subject to an exemption, medical devices require prior FDA authorization before they may be commercially marketed. Devices can be legally sold within the U.S. only if the FDA has: (i) approved application for pre-market approval application prior to marketing, generally applicable to most Class III devices; (ii) cleared the device in response to a 510(k) premarket notification submission, (“510(k)”), generally applicable to Class I and II devices; or (iii) reclassified the device pursuant to the de novo classification process, available for novel low or moderate risk devices. PMA applications, 510(k) premarket notifications, and de novo classification requests require payment of substantial user fees that are increased each fiscal year.
510(k) Premarket Notification
Product marketing in the U.S. for most Class II and a limited number of Class I devices typically follows the 510(k) premarket notification pathway. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, referred to as the “predicate device.” A predicate device may be a previously 510(k) cleared device or a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for PMA applications, or a product previously placed in Class II or Class I through the de novo classification process. The manufacturer must show that the proposed device has the same intended use as the predicate device, and 

 
it either has the same technological characteristics, or it is shown to be equally safe and effective and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the predicate device. A 510(k) may need to be supported by clinical data.
FDA has a user fee goal to apply no more than 90 calendar review days to 510(k) submissions. During the process, FDA may issue an Additional Information request, which stops the FDA’s review clock. The applicant has 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be up to 270 days, although it can take longer. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance for the modified device, the agency may require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance, de novo classification, or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
De Novo Classification
Devices of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. To avoid requiring PMA review of novel low- to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress enacted a provision that allows the FDA to classify a novel low- to moderate-risk device into Class I or II in the absence of a predicate device that would support 510(k) clearance. The FDA evaluates the safety and effectiveness of devices submitted for review under the de novo pathway, and devices determined to be Class II through this pathway can serve as predicate devices for future 510(k) applicants. The de novo pathway generally requires clinical data. As part of the de novo process FDA will establish special controls to help ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device.
FDA has a user fee goal to review a de novo request in 150 calendar review days. During the process, FDA may issue an Additional Information request, which stops the FDA’s review clock. The applicant has 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be as long as 330 days, although it can take longer.
PMA Approval
A Class III product not eligible for either 510(k) clearance or de novo classification must follow the PMA approval pathway.
Results from clinical trials are required for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. After completion of the required clinical testing, a PMA including the results of all non-clinical, clinical, and other testing and information relating to the product’s marketing history, design, labeling, manufacture, and controls, is prepared and submitted to the FDA.
The PMA approval process is generally more expensive, rigorous, lengthy, and uncertain than the 510(k) premarket notification process and de novo classification process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), requirements, which impose elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA has a user fee goal to review a PMA in 180 calendar review days, if the submission does not require advisory committee input, or 320 review days if the submission does require advisory committee input. During the process, FDA may issue a major deficiency letter, which stops the FDA’s review clock. The applicant has up to 180 days to respond. Therefore, the total review time could be up to 360 days, if the submission does not require advisory committee input, or 500 days if the submission does require advisory committee input, although it could take longer.
If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, post-approval studies and restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval and/or placement of restrictions on the sale of the device until the conditions are satisfied.
Even after approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process. Supplements to a PMA often require the submission of the same type of information required for an original PMA, except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered by the original PMA.
Clinical Trials
Generally, at least one clinical trial is required to support a PMA application. Clinical studies also may be required for de novo classification or a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials may also be conducted or continued to satisfy post-approval requirements for devices with PMAs. For significant risk investigational device studies, the FDA regulations require that human clinical investigations conducted in the U.S. be approved under an investigational device exemption (“IDE”), which must become effective before clinical testing may commence. A nonsignificant risk investigational device study does not require FDA approval of an IDE, although it does need to comply with some elements of the IDE regulations. In some cases, one or more smaller IDE studies may precede a pivotal clinical trial intended to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational device. A 30-

 
day waiting period after the submission of each IDE is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA disapproves the IDE within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IDE may not begin. Clinical trials of IVDs that meet certain regulatory criteria are exempt from the IDE regulations.
An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must also include a description of product manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. The FDA typically grants IDE approval for a specified number of patients to be treated at specified study centers. During the study, the sponsor must comply with the FDA’s IDE requirements for investigator selection, trial monitoring, reporting, and record keeping. The investigators must obtain patient informed consent, follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of investigational devices, and comply with reporting and record keeping requirements. Prior to granting PMA approval, the FDA typically inspects the records relating to the conduct of the study and the clinical data supporting the PMA application for compliance with IDE requirements.
Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (“GCP”), an international standard intended to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, investigators, and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Clinical trials are typically conducted at geographically diverse clinical trial sites and are designed to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the device and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the device when considering whether a device satisfies the statutory standard for commercialization. Clinical trials, for both significant and nonsignificant risk device studies, as well as exempt IVD studies, must be approved by an institutional review board (“IRB”), an appropriately constituted group that has been formally designated to review and monitor biomedical research involving human subjects and which has the authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove research to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human research subject. Informed consent of patients participating in the study generally must be obtained before they may participate in the study.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with the FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. An IRB may also require the clinical trial it has approved to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions or sanctions.
Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply to devices subject to FDA’s IDE regulations. The sponsor also must manufacture the investigational device in conformity with the quality controls described in the IDE application and any conditions of IDE approval that the FDA may impose with respect to manufacturing. 
Post-Market Requirements
After a device is placed on the market, numerous general regulatory controls apply. These include: the QSR (which requires manufacturers to have a quality policy and procedures to ensure that devices are manufactured and records maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing, complaint handling, and record keeping), labeling regulations, the medical device reporting regulations (which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), and reports of corrections and removals regulations (which require manufacturers to report recalls or removals and field corrections to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDC Act if that violation may present a risk to health). Failure to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to comply with other regulatory requirements, can subject a manufacturer to warning letters, recalls, or other sanctions and penalties.
As a manufacturer of IVDs, we are subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the FDC Act and regulations thereunder. We are required to register and list our products with the FDA and to comply with the QSR. We are required to submit a medical device report whenever we receive information that reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have had zero complaints that required us to submit a medical device report to FDA. Additionally, we are subject to inspection by the FDA. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling and promotion.
Marketing and promotional activities for devices, and advertising of some restricted medical devices, are also subject to FDA oversight and must comply with the statutory standards of the FDC Act, and the FDA’s regulatory requirements. The FDA’s oversight of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA also regulates industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context.  
Manufacturers of medical devices are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications that are consistent with those set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for “off-label” uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the approved or cleared labeling), 

 
including actions alleging that claims submitted to government healthcare programs for reimbursement of products that were promoted for “off-label” uses are in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes and that the submission of those claims was caused by off-label promotion. The failure to comply with prohibitions on “off-label” promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. Such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs.  
Violations of the FDC Act relating to the inappropriate promotion of approved products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.
For a PMA or Class II 510(k) or de novo device, the FDA also may impose post-market conditions of approval, such as testing, surveillance, or other measures to monitor the effects of an approved or cleared product. The FDA may place conditions on a PMA-approved device that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to the QSR after approval and clearance, and manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with the QSR. The FDA may withdraw product approvals or recommend or require product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory requirements.
Clinical studies of our IVD products, such as OvaWatch (formerly known as OvaNex), must be conducted in accordance with FDA’s investigational device exemption regulations. 
Our IVD devices also may require premarket authorization by FDA. Ova1, the first FDA-authorized blood test for the pre-operative assessment of ovarian masses, was authorized by the FDA in September 2009 under the de novo classification pathway. We received 510(k) clearance for Overa, our second-generation biomarker panel, in March 2016. 
We also may be required to conduct post-market surveillance of medical devices as a condition of granting marketing authorization. With respect to Ova1, the FDA required us to perform post-market surveillance to gather additional data regarding test performance. This study has been completed.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988
Clinical laboratories operating in or testing specimens from the U.S. are subject to CLIA, and related federal and state regulations, which provide for regulation of laboratory testing. Any customers using IVDs for clinical use in the United States will be regulated under CLIA, which establishes quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. In particular, these regulations mandate that clinical laboratories must be certified by the federal government or a federally approved accreditation agency or must be located in a state that has been deemed exempt from CLIA requirements because the state has in effect laws that provide for requirements equal to or more stringent than CLIA requirements. Moreover, these laboratories must meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards, and they must undergo proficiency testing and inspections. The CLIA standards applicable to clinical laboratories are based on the complexity of the method of testing performed by the laboratory, as deemed by FDA, which range from “waived” to “moderate complexity” to “high complexity.”
Laboratory Developed Tests
The FDA considers LDTs to be tests that are designed, developed, validated and used within a single laboratory. The FDA considers an LDT to be a test that is designed, developed, validated, and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has historically taken the position that it has the authority to regulate LDTs as medical devices under the FDC Act, but it has generally exercised enforcement discretion with regard to LDTs. This means that even though the FDA believes it can impose regulatory requirements on LDTs, such as requirements to obtain premarket approval or clearance of LDTs, it has generally chosen not to enforce those requirements as of the date of this Form 10-K. Although FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion for LDTs, the FDA retains discretion to require compliance with premarket when FDA deems it appropriate to address significant public health concerns. 
Legislative proposals addressing the FDA’s oversight of LDTs have been previously introduced. In March 2020, the Verifying Accurate, Leading-edge IVCT Development (“VALID”) Act of 2020 was introduced in the Senate, which proposes a risk-based regulatory framework for IVDs and LDTs and would require premarket approval for some in vitro clinical tests. The VALID Act was reintroduced in July 2021. In March 2020, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories (“VITAL”) Act of 2020 was introduced in the Senate, which would expressly shift the regulation of LDTs from FDA to CMS. The VITAL Act was reintroduced in May 2021. Neither statute has been enacted. FDA has indicated that in the absence of congressional action it may try adopting regulations that would cover LDTs.
The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of software used to support clinical decision making.  In 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, (the “Cures Act”), among other things, amended the medical device definition in the FDC Act to exclude certain software from FDA regulation, including clinical decision support, (“CDS software”), that meets certain criteria. CDS software is exempt from the medical device definition if it: (a) displays, analyzes or prints medical information about a patient or other medical information; (b) is intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations about a patient’s care to a health care professional, (“HCP”), user; and (c) provides sufficient information about 

 
the basis for the recommendations to the HCP user, so that the HCP user does not rely primarily on any of the recommendations to make a clinical decision about an individual patient; unless (d) the software function acquires, processes, or analyzes a medical image, a signal from an in vitro diagnostic device, or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system.
 On September 28, 2022, the FDA issued a final guidance document interpreting the Cures Act as it pertains to CDS software. Among other views expressed, the final guidance stated that software functions that assess or interpret the clinical implications or clinical relevance of a signal or pattern, such as those that process or analyze an electrochemical or photometric response generated by an assay and instrument to generate a clinical test result, are not exempt from medical device regulation. The final guidance also stated that software functions that generate risk probabilities or risk scores are not exempt because they necessarily provide a specific diagnostic, preventive, or treatment output.  
Our clinical laboratory activities are subject to CLIA and related state laws. In June 2014, we launched a clinical laboratory, Aspira Labs. Aspira Labs holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license or permit in California, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. In July 2021, we were granted a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation for our laboratory at our Connecticut office. We are subject to periodic surveys and inspections to maintain our CLIA certification, and such certification is also required to obtain payment from Medicare, Medicaid and certain other third-party payers.

Foreign Government Regulation of Our Products
We intend to obtain regulatory approval in other countries to market our tests. Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our potential future medical device products, to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In addition, products which have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1996. Each country also maintains its own regulatory review process, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements, product standards, and labeling requirements. In February 2015, Aspira also received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world’s leading certification bodies. In March 2015, Ova1 was CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union. In October 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 85 full-time employees. We generally engage independent contractors on a part-time basis from time to time.
