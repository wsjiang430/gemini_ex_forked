Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
Atlas Lithium Corporation (“Atlas Lithium”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our” refer to Atlas Lithium Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries) is a mineral exploration and development company with lithium projects and exploration properties in other critical and battery minerals, including nickel, rare earths, graphite, and titanium, to power the increased demand for electrification in our daily living, as exemplified by the rise in demand for electric vehicles, and simultaneous transition away from fossil fuels. Our current focus is on developing our hard-rock lithium project located in Minas Gerais State in Brazil at a well-known, premier pegmatitic district in Brazil. We intend to produce and sell lithium concentrate, a key ingredient for the global battery supply chain.
 
We are also in the initial stages of planning to develop and own 100% of a plant capable of producing 150,000 tons of lithium concentrate annually. However, there can be no assurance that such a facility may ultimately come to fruition or, if developed, that the production capacity will equal our expectations.
 
In December 2022, we signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (“Mitsui”), a global enterprise headquartered in Tokyo. The MOU contemplates potential funding from Mitsui to us of up to $65 million, to be made in tranches and subject to the achievement of specific milestones acceptable to Mitsui, that would give Mitsui the right to buy, at market price, up to 100% of our production from our planned plant with output capacity of 150,000 tons of lithium concentrate per year. There are no certainties that we will enter into a binding agreement with Mitsui, or that we will achieve any milestones acceptable to Mitsui or receive any funding from them.
 
All of our mineral projects and properties are located in Brazil and, as of the date of this Annual Report, our mineral rights portfolio for critical and battery minerals includes approximately 75,040 acres (304 km2) for lithium in 64 mineral rights, 54,950 acres for nickel (222 km2) in 15 mineral rights, 30,054 acres (122 km2) for rare earths in seven mineral rights, 22,050 acres (89 km2) for titanium in seven mineral rights, and 13,766 acres (56 km2) for graphite in three mineral rights.
 
Minas Gerais Lithium Project
 
Our Minas Gerais Lithium Project is currently our largest endeavor and primary focus. This project is located in northeastern Minas Gerais, Brazil along the prolific Eastern Brazilian Pegmatite Province (“EBP”) that extends more than 850 kilometers across eastern Minas Gerais. Pegmatites are igneous bodies derived during the final stages of crystallization of a larger parent igneous intrusion, most commonly a granitic rock. They are distinctive for their very coarse-grained crystalline texture, and in some instances, complex composition with unusual minerals and rare elements. Commercially productive lithium mineralization along the EBP is centered around the Araçuaí mining district which is host to the majority of Brazil’s commercial lithium production and reported mineral reserves.
 
Our current lithium property position in the State of Minas Gerais comprises 57 mineral rights totaling 58,774 acres (304 km2) which include five main clusters of prospective mineralization: Neves (currently being explored by drilling campaign), Itinga, Salinas, Santa Clara, and Tesouras. Our Neves and Santa Clara clusters are located directly adjacent to and along trend of a large cluster of lithium deposits currently being developed by Sigma Lithium Resources (Nasdaq: SGML).
 
Because of the region’s long mining history, basic local infrastructure near our mineral properties ranges from adequate to robust, with access to hydroelectric power and water supplies, a well-established road network with direct access to commercial ports. Basic goods and services, industrial suppliers and a skilled and semi-skilled labor force are also generally available from the surrounding communities where we operate.
 
Since initiating exploration at our Minas Gerais Lithium Project in early 2021, we have confirmed the widespread presence of hard-rock lithium-bearing pegmatites across our property portfolio.
 
During the second quarter of 2022, we engaged SLR International Corporation (“SLR”) to prepare an initial Technical Report Summary (“TRS”) compliant with the requirements of Items 1300 through 1305 of Regulation S-K (“Regulation S-K 1300”) on the ongoing and planned exploration of our 100%-owned Neves Lithium Project, located in Araçuaí, Minas Gerais, Brazil (the “Neves Project”). SLR is a global technical consulting firm which is well-known in the mining industry as a premier provider of technical reporting and certification. SLR visited our project site and discussed technical details with our geologists during the preparation of the TRS.
 
The TRS on the Neves Project is included as Exhibit 96.2 to this Annual Report. The effective date of such report is August 10, 2022.
 
Geology
 
The EBP is considered to be one of the world’s largest geologic belts of granites and related pegmatite intrusive bodies, encompassing more than 150,000 km2 and with more than 90% of the belt located in eastern Minas Gerais state. Pegmatites are igneous rocks that form during the final stages of a granitic magma’s crystallization. They are readily identifiable by their exceptionally coarse crystalline texture, with individual crystals averaging one centimeter or more in size. Most pegmatites have a simple mineral composition common to granitic rocks, however some may also contain less common minerals that are rarely found in other types of rocks. These include lithium minerals of commercial interest such as spodumene which can contain up to 3.73% Li (8.03% LiO2), and petalite with up to 2.09% Li (4.50% LiO2).

-


Our project area encompasses multiple areas of mineralized pegmatites, in general occurring as series of sub-parallel elongate tabular bodies, referred to as ‘pegmatite dike swarms,’ hosted in metamorphic shists. Individual pegmatite bodies range from several meters to more than 50 meters thick and from tens of meters up to one (1) kilometer in lateral strike length. They are primarily composed of the minerals quartz, feldspar and mica with localized concentrations of spodumene and petalite. Individual feldspar and spodumene crystals can reach up to two meters in length, but typically are more homogeneously distributed and ranging in size from one to a few centimeters in length.
 
Exploration
 
Since initiating our exploration program in 2021, our team has focused on evaluating the Neves target area through a systematic approach involving a combination of basic prospecting, geologic field mapping, trenching and geochemical sampling, and diamond drilling.
Exploration Targets
 
Neves target area


From August 2021 to March 2023, 81 diamond drill holes totaling 9,285 meters have been completed at Atlas’ flagship Das Neves (“Neves”) property. At Neves, our current focus is on the Abelhas pegmatite cluster, a system of northeasterly trending intrusive dikes (or ‘dike swarm’) that has been mapped over an approximate 1,000-meter by 400-meter area.

Seven diamond drill core rigs are currently operating, with an eighth drill expected for early April 2023.
 
Recently, we released assay results for the drill holes completed at Neves. Significant highlights for such drill holes include:
 

1.72% Li2O over 3.5 meters Estimated True Width (“ETW”) in hole AB-11 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.22% Li2O over 17.3 meters ETW in hole AB-11B 
1.33% Li2O over 4.8 meters ETW in hole AB-12 1.21% Li2O over 7.9 meters ETW in hole AB-13 
1.00% Li2O over 18.2 meters ETW in hole AB-15 
1.00% Li2O over 8.0 meters ETW in hole AB-18 
1.00% Li2O over 21.2 meters ETW in hole AB-21 1.49% Li2O over 8.0 meters ETW in hole AB-39B 1.29% Li2O over 6.9 meters ETW in hole AB-39B 1.30 Li2O over 27.0 meters ETW in hole AB-41 1.37% Li2O over 14.0 meters ETW in hole AB-57 1.15% Li2O over 21.6 meters ETW in hole AB-64 

 
Initially, drilling at Abelhas began immediately south of the historic working, returning multiple pegmatite intercepts over thicknesses ranging from 1 to 11 meters ETW. As the majority of these intercepts were relatively shallow and within 50 meters vertical depth from surface, lithium contents were generally low due to the effects of near-surface weathering and oxidation. Systematic step-out drilling to the south has returned multiple intercepts of higher-grade lithium mineralization hosted in fresh un-weathered pegmatite with grades ranging from 1.00% Li2O to as high as 3.26% Li2O.
 
In February 2023, a new target named “Anitta” was intercepted, extending the “Neves” trend ore body to approximately 1.1 kilometer. The initial Anitta drilling holes (southeast of the mineralization trend) intersected pegmatite intervals with spodumene mineralization, including a section of 4.40% Li2O. A grid of 100 drill holes is currently being executed encompassing areas on and around the Southwestern portion of Anitta, as well as areas connecting the Southwestern portion of Anitta to the original Abelhas target. This drilling campaign phase is expected to be finalized in eight weeks.
 
Main intersects of the new target:
 
DHAB-69 – 02 intersects totaling 16.0 meters of pegmatite.
 DHAB-68 – 04 intersects totaling 67.1 meters of pegmatite.
 DHAB-70 – 04 intersects totaling 44.6 meters of pegmatite.
 DHAB-77 – 02 intersects totaling 29.1 meters of pegmatite.
 DHAB-47 – 03 intersects totaling 28.3 meters of pegmatite.

Additionally, through geological mapping in the identification of new outcrops and the soil geochemistry work carried out so far, new trends mineralized in lithium to the East and Northwest of Abelhas were identified, as shown in the map below. Exploration holes are planned for early April 2023 in these respective areas.

Soil Geochemistry
 
Since November 2022, soil geochemistry campaigns have been started in the Neves project with the aim of identifying areas with the existence of a lithium anomaly and also comparing the anomalies with data from the geological mapping already carried out.
 
The survey was guided by NW-SE direction lines spaced every 100 meters. Sampling points were defined along these lines, every 25 meters on average, depending on physiographic conditions (topography, vegetation, obstacles such as outcrops). For the process of collecting soil samples, a portable mechanized auger equipped with a gasoline engine, rods and drills or shells was used. The sample collection was carried out with an average depth of 1 meter, in order to go beyond the layer of organic soil.

Santa Clara Target
 
At the Santa Clara Target, preliminary reconnaissance mapping has identified petalite-bearing pegmatite with anomalous concentrations of lithium exposed in an inactive artisanal mine working and nearby outcrops that are exposed over an area measuring approximately 100 meters long by 30 meters wide. The three other pegmatites identified in the Santa Clara area have been mapped over areas ranging from 150 to 240 meters in length by 10 to 15 meters in width. All three of these bodies are only partially exposed at surface, remaining open in both directions along strike and at depth.

Salinas Target
 
At the Salinas Target, preliminary field reconnaissance by our team of geologists has identified several spodumene-bearing pegmatites. The exposed outcropping portion of one of these pegmatites measures approximately 200 meters in length by 40 meters in width. This pegmatite is located one kilometer from “Lavra do Oscar,” a large artisanal mining site that has produced spodumene in the past.

Itinga Target
 
The Itinga project includes four newly acquired mineral rights and two mineral rights previously owned by us
 

Geological mapping work was carried out in these areas and areas with potential lithium mineralization were identified.
 

Expressive pegmatitic body outcropping in artisanal mines
 
Northeastern Brazil Lithium Project
 
Our Northeastern Brazil Lithium Project encompasses seven mineral rights spread over approximately 16,266 acres (66 km2) in the States of Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte, both located in Brazil’s Northeastern region. We have identified pegmatites in many of our areas, and several of our mineral rights are located near to or adjacent to areas known to have spodumene, a lithium-bearing mineral. We plan to continue to explore our areas to assess whether we have any economic deposits.

Metallurgical Testing
 
A comprehensive metallurgical testing of a representative ore sample of our Neves Project has been carried out at the SGS analytical laboratory in Lakefield, Canada (“SGS Lakefield”). SGS Lakefield is a world-renowned testing facility within the mining industry and has been providing independent assessments since 1941. Preliminary results from studies with our ore indicate three important characteristics: easy separation of lithium, robust concentration of lithium, and low impurities such as iron. SGS Lakefield was able to process our ore to commercial grade spodumene concentrate (also called lithium concentrate) using standard dense media separation (“DMS”) methods. We expect to receive the complete report on such studies from SGS Lakefield in April 2023.
 
Looking forward, in parallel with our ongoing exploration program, we plan to conduct metallurgical testing on an ongoing basis as we continue to drill test and delineate potential lithium mineral resources across our property portfolio.
 
Lithium
 
Market
 
In 2021, the Global Lithium market was valued at USD 4,650 Million in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% during the forecast period of 2023-2028. The market for lithium-ion batteries is predicted to grow even larger over the forecast period as a result of the electrification of cars.
 

Due to the strict rules that ICE automakers must adhere to in order to minimize carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles, the automotive application market is predicted to increase significantly over the course of the projection period. This has caused automakers to become more interested in creating EVs, which is expected to increase demand for lithium and related goods. Together with investments in this area, government subsidies for Electric Vehicles (EVs) are projected to serve as an additional catalyst for the market’s expansion.”

Electric Vehicle Demand
 
Increasing demand for lithium for manufacturing EV batteries is another factor driving market revenue growth. Despite the effects of COVID-19 in the automobile industry, sales of EVs increased by almost 50% in 2020 and increased almost double to about seven million units in 2021. When compared to a five-year average of about USD 14,500 per metric ton, lithium prices have risen by about 550% in a year due to surge in EV demand. By the beginning of March 2022, price of lithium carbonate had surpassed USD 75,000 per metric ton and price of lithium hydroxide had surpassed USD 65,000 per metric ton. Moreover, almost all traction batteries used currently in EVs and consumer gadgets are produced using lithium, while other uses for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries include everything from energy storage to air travel. There are numerous unknowns regarding how the battery market will impact future lithium demand as battery content changes depending on active materials mix and new battery technologies are entering the market. For instance, compared to currently popular mixes using a graphite anode and lithium metal anode, which increases energy density in batteries, has roughly quadruple lithium needs per kilowatt-hour.”

Recent Developments Potentially Affecting Lithium Demand
 
United States
 
On August 25, 2022, the Washington Post published an article titled “Did California just kill the gas-powered car?” and with the sub-heading “California’s decision to ban the sales of combustion engine cars is the latest victory in the transition to electric vehicles,” stating among things that:
 
“California, which already leads the nation with 18% of new cars sold electric, is expected to approve a regulation to ban the sales of new gas-only powered vehicles by 2035. In addition to EVs, only a limited number of plug-in hybrids will be allowed to be sold and that in California’s car market is only slightly smaller than those of France, Italy and Britain - and while many countries have promised to phase out sales of gas cars by such-and-such date, few have concrete regulations like California.”

US EV battery demand is strong
 

European Union
 
On June 8, 2022, the European Union Parliament voted to ban the sale of new diesel and gasoline cars and vans starting in 2035.
 
Although no assurances can be given, these recent developments, if left unchallenged, may potentially increase demand for lithium in the U.S., European Union and other jurisdictions adopting similar bans on gas-powered vehicles.
Dynamic Lithium Prices
 
Directly relevant to our goal to produce lithium concentrate (also called spodumene concentrate) for sale, it is important to note that the prices of such commodity have been volatile. According to Platts, a unit of S&P Global, a market intelligence firm, the price of spodumene concentrate FOB Australia (ticker symbol: BATSP03) was $6,300 per ton on January 13, 2023 and more recently, on March 27, 2023, it was $4,750.

Current Predictions
 
Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a well-respected global consulting firm specializing in the battery supply chain market, predicts that:
 

i) | demand for lithium-ion batteries is set to grow six-fold by 2032 as global automakers scale up production of EVs, and 
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii) | to meet the world’s lithium requirements would require 74 new lithium mines with an average size of 45,000 tonnes by 2035. 

Future Production and Sales
 
We expect the demand for our lithium concentrate, once in production, to be facilitated by Brazil’s strong mining tradition and its substantial annual trade with China, the United States, and the European Union. We intend to utilize third party intermediaries for the sale of our products to allow us to focus on our core competencies of exploration and extraction.
Other Mineral Properties
 
We also have 100%-ownership of early-stage projects and properties in other minerals that are needed in the battery supply chain and high technology applications such as nickel, rare earths, graphite, and titanium. We believe that the shift from fossil fuels to battery power will yield long-term opportunities for us not only in lithium but also in the other critical and battery minerals.
 
Additionally, we have 100%-ownership of several mining concessions for gold and diamonds, two of which also include industrial sand. As our corporate focus became our lithium properties and those of other critical minerals, we stopped alluvial gold and diamond exploration efforts in 2018 and the sale of our industrial sand in 2022.
 
As of the date of this Annual Report we also own: (i) 45.11% of the common stock of Apollo Resources Corporation (“Apollo Resources”), a private company with exploration projects for iron in Brazil, and primarily focused on the development of its initial iron mine, located in the municipality of Rio Piracicaba in the state of Minas Gerais, for which it received in October 2022 a permit to mine from Agencia Nacional de Mineracao (“ANM”, the Brazilian mining department) and awaits the operational license from Superintendencia do Meio Ambiente (“SUPRAM”, the State of Minas Gerais environmental department) within the next 12 months and (ii) 28.72% of Jupiter Gold Corporation (“Jupiter Gold”), a publicly-traded company with exploration projects for gold and a developing quartzite quarry operation, all in Brazil, and whose common stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol “JUPGF”. The quartzite mine is fully permitted by ANM and SUPRAM and is expected to start operations later in 2023
 
We have determined that Apollo Resources and Jupiter Gold represent Variable Interest Entities (see our “Variable Interest Entities” discussion on page [34] of this Annual Report). As a result of such determination, the results of operations from both Apollo Resources and Jupiter Gold are consolidated in our financial statements under the United States general accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
 
Nickel & Cobalt
 
Market
 
Nickel and cobalt are key battery minerals needed for the growth phase in EV production. Cobalt is on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States as first published by the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 18, 2018. In general, the greater the amount of nickel and cobalt, the greater the energy density of an EV battery, a factor that contributes to the storage of more energy. As a practical example of the importance of nickel and cobalt, EVs whose batteries have a higher energy density can run more kilometers before a recharge is needed. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, 72 mining projects with an average size of 42,500 tonnes will be required to meet battery demand for refined nickel by 2035.
Summary of Our Opportunity
 
We own 15 mineral rights for nickel (including two mineral rights for both nickel and cobalt) totaling approximately 54,950 acres (222 km2). These mineral rights are divided in two sub-groups according to geography: Nickel I Properties in the State of Goiás and Nickel II Properties in the State of Piauí. Several of our mineral rights are located near to or adjacent to areas of known nickel and associated cobalt mineralization.
 
Nickel and associated cobalt mineralization often occurs as near-surface deposits hosted within a large complex of magnesium and iron rich plutonic rocks, referred to as ultramafics, that originally formed in the earth’s lower crust and upper mantle. In addition to magnesium and iron, ultramafic rocks typically contain minor amounts of nickel along with lesser amounts of cobalt. Tectonic uplift of the ultramafic sequence followed by exposure to intense tropical weathering processes has resulted in the formation of a nickel and cobalt enriched rock commonly referred to as nickel laterite. Nickel laterite deposits currently account for 40% of global nickel production are becoming an increasingly important source of nickel metal for world demand. They typically occur as very large tonnage, low grade deposits, and being close to the surface, are very amenable to open pit mining methods.
 

20
--


Our Nickel I property located in the Niquelandia district in north-central Goiás state has been Brazil’s national center of commercial nickel production since the early 1980’s. Here nickel laterite mineralization is reported to occur in nickel-bearing iron oxides and clays which are processed via pyrometallurgical recovery methods. Cobalt is recovered as a secondary by-product. Our Nickel II property in southeastern Piauí state is located in the general area of a newly commissioned open pit mining operation which commenced commercial production earlier this year. Based on reports published by the mine operator, a publicly traded company, nickel laterite mineralization in the area occurs as clay-poor, oxide rich material amenable to lower cost heap leach recovery methods. This relatively new approach to nickel ore processing and recovery offers the potential for the commercial development of lower grade resources that would otherwise be uneconomic using more conventional pyrometallurgical recovery methods.
 
We plan to assess the potential of our nickel-cobalt properties through a systematic three-phase exploration approach. The first phase will involve a combination of analysis and interpretation of commercially available remote sensing satellite data, followed by geologic field reconnaissance and regional scale geochemical stream sediment sampling to identify areas offering the best potential for new nickel-cobalt discoveries. Based on the results of the first phase, the second phase will involve a combination of more detailed geologic mapping, geochemical soil and rock grid sampling, and airborne and ground-based geophysical surveys to identify and prioritize the most prospective areas for drill targeting. The third phase will involve first pass reconnaissance drilling of selected targets to test the presence and distribution of prospective mineralization, with additional follow-up drilling to be conducted as results warrant.
 
Rare Earths
 
Market
 
The rare earth elements (“REE”) are on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States as first published by the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 18, 2018. REEs consist of the lanthanide series (lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, and lutetium) as well as scandium and yttrium. REEs are classified as “light” and “heavy” based on atomic number. Light REEs (LREEs) are comprised of lanthanum through gadolinium (atomic numbers 57 through 64). Heavy REEs (HREEs) are comprised of terbium through lutetium (atomic numbers 65 through 71) and yttrium (atomic number 39), which has similar chemical and physical attributes to the HREEs. Neodymium and praseodymium are key critical materials in the manufacturing of magnets that have the highest magnetic strength among commercially available magnets and enable high energy density and high energy efficiency in diverse uses. Dysprosium and terbium are key critical materials often added to the magnet alloys to increase the operating temperature. HREEs tend to be less abundant and more expensive than LREEs.
Summary of Our Opportunity
 
We own seven mineral rights for rare earths totaling approximately 30,054 acres (122 km2). These mineral rights are divided in two sub-types according to geology: Rare Earths I Properties in the States of Goiás and Tocantins, and Rare Earths II Properties in the State of Bahia. Several of our mineral rights are located near to or adjacent to areas known to have rare earths deposits. Preliminary geochemical sampling of some of our areas indicated presence of rare earths. We plan to continue to explore our areas to assess as to whether we have any economic deposits.
Titanium
 
Titanium is on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States as first published by the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 18, 2018. Titanium can withstand high temperatures and its non-magnetic nature prevents interference with data storage components. It has widespread use in high-technology and aerospace applications.

21
--


We own seven mineral rights for titanium totaling approximately 22,050 acres (89 km2). These mineral rights are all located in the State of Minas Gerais and are referred to as our Titanium Properties. Several of our mineral rights are located near to or adjacent to areas known to have titanium deposits. We plan to explore our areas to assess as to whether we have any economic deposits.
 
Graphite
 
Graphite is on the list of the 35 minerals considered critical to the economic and national security of the United States as first published by the U.S. Department of the Interior on May 18, 2018. Graphite is the most used anode in lithium batteries, benefitting from its high energy and power density. The global need for high-quality, low impurity graphite is directly related to the growth in EV adoption as discussed above. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, to meet demand for anode materials, an estimated 97 natural flake graphite mines will need to be built by 2035, assuming an average size of 56,000 tonnes a year and no contribution from recycling.
 
We own three mineral rights for graphite totaling approximately 13,766 acres (56 km2). These mineral rights are all located in the State of Minas Gerais and are referred to as our Graphite Properties. All of our mineral rights are located immediately adjacent to areas known for graphite deposits. We plan to explore our areas to assess as to whether we have any economic deposits.
 
Iron (Through Our Partial Ownership of Apollo Resources Corporation)
 
Market
 
Historically, iron has been an essential metal to human development and economic growth. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, over 98% of mined iron ore is used in steel manufacturing. Brazil is the second biggest iron ore producer and exporter in the world, after Australia. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, iron ore prices reached a six-year high in 2021 primarily fueled by demand from China, the largest importer, while demand from India continues to increase, according to Trading Economics, a market intelligence firm.
Summary of Our Opportunity
 
Our subsidiary, Apollo Resources, is focused on iron projects in Brazil. Apollo Resources currently owns 56,290 acres of mineral rights for iron distributed in six projects, five of which are in early stage while its Rio Piracicaba Project in Brazil’s well-known Iron Quadrangle mining district is being advanced towards an iron mine, expected to begin operations in 2024 (the “Rio Piracicaba Project”). The Iron Quadrangle is one of the premier iron producing regions in the world.
 
In 2020, Apollo Resources acquired from a third-party 641-acre mineral right where its Rio Piracicaba Project is now located. This mineral right sits immediately adjacent to Agua Limpa, a producing iron mine owned and operated by Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE).
 
During the first and second quarters of 2021, detailed drilling and trenching under the supervision of iron geologists was carried out in approximately 10% of the mineral right area encompassing the Rio Piracicaba Project. Subsequently, a Qualified Person for iron, as the term is defined in Regulation S-K 1300, worked on the analysis and interpretation of the geotechnical work performed.
 
A Technical Report Summary of the Rio Piracicaba Project (the “Rio Piracicaba TRS”) prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-K 1300 is included as Exhibit 96.1 to this Annual Report. The effective date of Rio Piracicaba TRS is March 30, 2022. This report was prepared by Orlando Garcia Rocha Filho, a principal at RCS Geologia e Meio Ambiente Ltda., and Volodymyr Myadzel, PhD, an independent consultant at the time, and currently a member of  our internal lithium geological team. With respect to the Rio Piracicaba TRS, Mr. Rocha Filho and Dr, Myadzel are Qualified Persons for Iron according to Regulation S-K 1300.
 
Apollo Resources has full and titled ownership of the mineral right in which the Rio Piracicaba Project is being developed and 100%-ownership of such project. Therefore, the resources presented in the Rio Piracicaba TRS are attributable to Apollo Resources’ interest in such property. A summary table for each class of mineral resource (measured, indicated, and inferred) as found in the Rio Piracicaba TRS is also included below:
 

 | Measured Mineral Resource | | Indicated Mineral Resource | | Inferred Mineral Resource 
----------------------------------+-------------------------------+---+--------------------------------+---+------------------------------
 | Amount (tons) | | Grade | | Amount (tons) | Grade (% iron) | Amount (tons) | | Grade (% iron) 
Iron - Rio Piracicaba Project | | - | | - | | 2,646,141 | | 33.74 | | 5,206,771 | 30.40

 
The following disclosures apply to the summary table above:
 
1. “Mineral Resources” is defined in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-K 1300.
 2. Mineral Resources are estimated at a cut-off grade of 20% iron.

Quartzite (Through Our Subsidiary Jupiter Gold Corporation)
 
Market
 
Quartzite is a very hard rock composed predominantly of an interlocking mosaic of quartz crystals. Recently polished quartzite slabs have become sought after as a higher-end substitute to granite in kitchen countertops and tiles. Brazil has a robust  quartzite mining industry centered in the neighboring the States of Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo with smaller producers being the norm. Each quarry produces quartzite of different color and texture and therefore stones are unique to their location. Mining is via simple open pit procedures, not particularly labor intensive, and with the mined product normally prepared as cubes of raw quartzite measuring ten meters in each diameter. Buyers are normally responsible for the logistics of transporting such raw quartzite blocks from the mine. Buyers for quartzite mined in Brazil are primarily from four locations: Brazil itself, United States, China, and Italy. It is common for mines to develop an exclusive selling relationship to a buyer.
Summary of Our Opportunity
 
While our subsidiary Jupiter Gold is primarily focused on gold in Brazil, in one of its mineral rights, measuring 233 acres, a greenfield deposit of quartzite was identified by its exploration team and became its “Quartzite Project”. The Quartzite Project is in the State of Minas Gerais in Brazil, in a region known for quartzite mining.
 
In 2021, Jupiter Gold studied the Quartzite Project with detailed drilling, and a preliminary volumetric estimate of a deposit was obtained. In 2021, Yan Taffner Binda, a mining engineer with vast experience in quartzite, who meets the definition of a Qualified Person in Regulation S-K 1300, prepared the operational plan for an open pit quarry at the Quartzite Project. An initial mining license from ANM has been obtained.
 
In 2021, Geoline, an independent engineering and environmental licensing consultancy, performed the field studies needed to file Jupiter Gold’s petition to the applicable regulatory body for an operation license. Jupiter Gold’s expectation is to obtain such approval within the next three to six months, which would allow it to start operations and thereafter revenues in 2023. Jupiter Gold anticipates that its quartzite quarry will require five on-site full-time employees; expected prices for the type of color and texture of the quartzite anticipated to be mined range from $1,200 to $2,000 per cubic meter. In December 2022, Jupiter Gold received the operational license for its quartzite mine, and plans to begin operations in 2023.
 
As of the date of this Report, we own 28.72% of the common stock of Jupiter Gold.
 
Gold (Through Our Subsidiary Jupiter Gold Corporation)
 
Market
 
Brazil has been a gold producer for over 200 years. According to the World Gold Council, in 2021 Brazil produced 90.1 tons of gold and was the 14th largest gold producer country. Minas Gerais was the largest gold producing state in Brazil, accounting for over half of the country’s production in 2021, according to Statista, a market intelligence firm.
Summary of Our Opportunity
 
Our subsidiary Jupiter Gold owns 142,017 acres of mineral rights for gold distributed in seven projects, six of which are in early stage while one of them, the “Alpha Project,” has been preliminarily researched and is being developed towards a gold mine. The Alpha Project is located in the State of Minas Gerais at the eastern edge of the Iron Quadrangle mining district, the number one gold-producing region in Brazil.

Jupiter Gold’s 100%-owned Alpha Project encompasses 31,650 acres distributed in twelve mineral rights for gold. Approximately 2% of this total area has been studied over 15 years ago by a prior owner, by drilling superficial terrain layers of saprolite and colluvium and identifying gold in multiple targets. The technical report produced at that time under the ANM standard had an estimated gold mineralization for the small area of the deposit in which work was performed.
 
In 2020, detailed trenching under the supervision of gold geologists was carried out in approximately 2% of the mineral right area encompassing the Alpha Project. In 2021, Oxford Geoconsultants, a technical consulting firm with a geologist that meets the Qualified Person definition of Regulation S-K 1300, released an independent technical report on the project.
 
RCS, an independent advisory firm with a gold geologist that meets the Qualified Person definition of Regulation S-K 1300, has preliminarily indicated that the gold deposits at the Alpha Project are of greenstone belt type. Further work is planned for 2023 and 2024at the Alpha Project to expand the knowledge of and the measured size of the deposit.
 
As of the date of this Report, Atlas Lithium owns 28.72% of the common stock of Jupiter Gold.
 
Alluvial Gold and Diamonds
 
We own several mining concessions for gold and diamonds along the banks of the Jequitinhonha River in the State of Minas Gerais, in a region where gold and diamonds have been mined for more than 200 years.
 
The predecessor owner of one of our current mining concessions for gold and diamonds was Valdiaam, a TSXV-listed company. Such company performed detailed drilling and other studies leading to the publication of technical reports.
 
We own an alluvial diamond and gold processing plant which was built by such prior owner at an estimated cost of $2.5 million. To the best of our knowledge, this plant is the largest such type of alluvial recovery plant in Brazil.
 
We are not currently engaged in alluvial diamond and gold mining operations as we are focusing our limited capital and team on lithium because of its exceptional growth in demand at the present time.

Government Regulation
 
Mining Regulation and Compliance
 
Mining regulation in Brazil is carried out by ANM, a federal entity, with offices in each state in Brazil.. For each mineral right that we own, we file the required paperwork with the ANM office of the state in which such mineral right is located. We believe that we maintain a good relationship with ANM and that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs. For mineral rights which have an operating mine, ANM will normally inspect such projects once a year through an unannounced visit.
Environmental Regulation and Compliance
 
Environmental regulation in Brazil is carried out by a state-level agency, which may have multiple offices, one for each region of the state. For instance, in Minas Gerais State, such agency is called SUPRAM. For each mineral right that we own, after sufficient exploration work has been conducted, we may apply for operational permitting towards mining by filing any such paperwork with the local office of the environmental agency that has the applicable geographical jurisdiction. We believe that we maintain a good relationship with the offices of the environmental agency and believe that our methods of monitoring are adequate for our current needs. The environmental agency normally inspects our operations once every one or two years which is the standard practice for companies in good standing.
 
Surface disturbance from any open pit mining performed by us is in full compliance with our mining plan as approved by the local regulatory agencies. We regularly restore areas that have been exploited by us. The current environmental regulations state that for a period of five years after all mining operations have ceased (however long that may take), we would still be required to perform any necessary recuperation work.
 
Environmental, Social and Governance
 
We are committed to Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) causes. Our Chief of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance coordinates our efforts in these important matters. We believe that our efforts make a difference in the communities in which we operate. For example, in the period from 2018 to 2020e planted more than 6,000 trees of diverse types for the benefit of local populations in areas in which we operate. During this same period, we also constructed over 1,000 small retention walls to preserve and enhance dirt access roads used by such communities. Our current efforts are focused on hiring workers from communities near our project areas. Many such communities have high levels of unemployment and we thus believe that we are making a positive contribution.
