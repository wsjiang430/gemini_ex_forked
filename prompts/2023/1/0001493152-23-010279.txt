ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
This Business section, along with other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K, includes statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties. Industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies generally indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe that these industry publications and third-party research, surveys and studies are reliable, we have not independently verified such data and we do not make any representation as to the accuracy of the information. Unless the context otherwise requires, “Hour Loop,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” refers to Hour Loop, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 
Overview
 
Our Business
 
We are an online retailer engaged in e-commerce retailing in the U.S. market. We have operated as a third-party seller on www.amazon.com since 2013. We have also sold merchandise on our website at www.hourloop.com since 2013. We expanded our operations to other marketplaces such as Walmart, eBay and Etsy in the third quarter of 2020, 2022, and 2022, respectively. To date, we have generated practically all of our revenue as a third-party seller on www.amazon.com and only a negligible amount of revenue from our operations on our website at www.hourloop.com and as a third-party seller on other marketplaces. We manage more than 100,000 stock-keeping units (“SKUs”). Product categories include home/garden décor, toys, kitchenware, apparels, and electronics. Our primary strategy is to bring most of our vendors product selections to the customers. We have advanced software that assists us in identifying product gaps so we can keep such products in stock year-round including the entirety of the last quarter (holiday season) of the calendar year (“Q4”). In upcoming years, we plan to expand our business by increasing the number of business managers, vendors and SKUs while improving on profitability.
Business Model
 
There are three main types of business models on Amazon: wholesale, private label and retail arbitrage. Our business model is wholesale, also known as reselling, which refers to buying products in bulk directly from the brand or manufacturer at a wholesale price and making a profit by selling the product on Amazon. We sell merchandise on Amazon and the sales are fulfilled by Amazon. We pay Amazon fees for allowing us to sell on their platform. Our relationship with Walmart is also similar. We pay Walmart fees for allowing us to sell our merchandise on their platform. As stated above, to date, we have generated only a negligible amount of revenues as a third-party seller on www.walmart.com.
 
The advantages of selling via a wholesale model:
 

● | Purchase lower unit quantities with wholesale orders than private label products. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Selling wholesale is less time intensive and easier to scale than sourcing products via retail arbitrage. 
● | More brands will want to work with us because we can provide broader Amazon presence. 

 
The challenges of selling via a wholesale model:
 

● | Fierce competition on listing for Buy Box on amazon.com (as described below). 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Developing and maintaining relationships with brand manufacturers.

Market Description/Opportunities
 
According to Marketplace Pulse, total retail sales increased 18% to $6.56 trillion in 2021 from $5.56 trillion in 2020. U.S. ecommerce sales increased 18% to $960.15 billion in 2021 from $811.56 billion in 2020.
 
Amazon accounted for nearly 40% of all e-commerce in the United States and that makes Amazon the biggest ecommerce giant currently in the market.
 
Formation
 
We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on January 13, 2015. In 2019, we formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Flywheel Consulting Ltd. (“Flywheel”), to provide business operating consulting services, exclusively to Hour Loop. On April 7, 2021, Hour Loop converted from a Washington corporation to a Delaware corporation. The Company was founded in 2013 by Sam Lai and Maggie Yu. With their vision, leadership, and software development skills, the Company grew rapidly. From 2013 to 2022, net sales grew from $0 to $95,930,091.
Competitive Advantage
 
Among more than 2 million active third-party sellers on Amazon, we believe we have two main competitive advantages:
 

● | First, we have strong operations and sales teams experienced in listing, shipment, advertising, reconciliation and sales. By delivering high quality results and enhancing procedures through the process, our teams are competitive. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Second, we believe our proprietary software system gives us an advantage over our competition. The system is highly customized to our business model; it collects and processes large amounts of data every day to optimize our operation and sales. Through advanced software, we can identify product gaps and keep them in stock all year round. 

 
With respect to our advertising strategy, we advertise those products that we estimate will have greater demand based on our experience. This lets us allocate our advertising budget in a fashion that delivers positive value. We advertise our products on Amazon. We allocate our advertising dollars prudently. This is accomplished by advertising items that deliver the most return for our advertising spending. We monitor the items being advertised by our competitors. On the operations side, we constantly refine our processes based on learnings from historical data. The combination of managing the business operations effectively along with allocating our advertising budget to high value items allows us to grow profitably. In cases where the advertising is fierce, we allocate the spending appropriately. Our strategy for competing with larger competitors is to monitor their pricing and not compete with them when their pricing is low or at a loss. Competitors sell at low prices or at a loss due to a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, their desire to liquidate inventory or achieve short term increase in revenue. During these times, we avoid matching their prices. This strategy allows us to stay profitable.
 
Historical Performance
 
Our year end net revenues and net income (loss) from 2013 through 2022 is presented in the table below:

Pricing Strategy and Policies
 
In an ideal world, we would like to price our products at key stone pricing or double wholesale cost. However, we operate in a hyper competitive environment and we must stay competitive. Therefore, we must draw a good balance between gross margin and revenue. Our main objectives focus on increasing volume and maximizing profits, which is achieved with a customized auto pricing system we developed internally, in combination with well-trained business managers’ judgment on pricing skills as well as constant monitoring. One principal feature of the pricing system is that it automatically syncs public data of competing offers from Amazon regularly, so business managers can make price settings and adjustments based on accurate data, and thus be able to set optimal selling prices for products. In addition, the system is constantly improved with new features and optimizations.
 
At a high level, our automated pricing tool helps us stay competitive while our business managers mainly focus on increasing gross margins. Our proprietary repricing tool analyze sales trend, projected sales, inventory age, inventory cost, potential profits, Fulfillment by Amazon (“FBA”) fees, competing offers, and seasonality and determines an urgency level, then depending on the level of urgency, it automatically adjusts prices accordingly.
 
Business managers, after establishing the bases for prices, begin to develop pricing strategies for each product while taking the current market conditions, company goals (e.g., increasing short-term or long-term profits) and strategies into consideration. Furthermore, business managers consider different marketing segments such as costs and competitions in order to develop effective pricing strategies and policies.
 
The following subsections provide more insight into various pricing strategies we have developed over the years. Our internal training mainly focuses on competition-based pricing policy and value-based pricing policy.
 

1. | Competition-Based Pricing Policy: 20% of our products are toys, which are extremely popular and competitive. In this type of environment where volume is high but gross margin is low, our main strategy is to purchase large quantities, so we can increase sales volume and price competitively while maintaining an average return on investment (“ROI”) of at least 15%. We are using the competition-based pricing policy to match competitors’ prices, which means constantly winning Buy Box (as described below). Our pricing system is capable of automatically matching all Buy Box. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Promotional Pricing Policy: To boost lagging sales, we adapted our own promotional pricing policy, which involves offering modest discounts on products with inventory age over 45 days, which proves to be cost-effective at reducing the number of low turn-over SKUs. 
3. | Value-Based Pricing Policy: We incorporate a value-based pricing strategy when inventories are constrained, which can happen when customer demand suddenly spikes due to external factors, supply shortage, or seasonal spikes. We set prices to reflect the value perceived by customers, especially on products under gift categories when consumer demands are higher. Contrary to a typical seller, we opt to maintain high gross margin instead of marking down prices and running special deals during the high-demand season during Q4. Therefore, business managers can achieve increases in both sales and high average ROI of 40%. 

 
Buy Box on amazon.com is the top right section on a product page where customers can directly add items to their shopping carts. Since many sellers on amazon.com can sell the same product, they must compete to “win the Buy Box” for a certain product. Winning the Amazon Buy Box simply means that you were chosen for the Buy Box placement. When you win this placement, customers have a button to directly add your product to their carts, giving you an advantage over competing sellers. For a seller to be eligible for the Buy Box, they must meet a set of performance-based requirements, including order defect rate, customer shopping experience, time and experience on the Amazon selling platform, and status as a professional seller.

Overview of Market & Competition
 
According to Marketplace Pulse, total U.S.US retail sales increased 18% to $6.56 trillion in 2021 from $5.56 trillion in 2020. U.S. ecommerce sales increased 18% to $960.15 billion in 2021 from $811.56 billion in 2020.
 
In 2021, total U.S. ecommerce sales reached $959.5 billion, an 18.3% year-over-year increase from $811.6 billion in 2020. This is significantly less than the U.S. ecommerce growth rate of 2020, during which total sales increased by 42.4% year-over-year from 2019.
 
Despite the slowdown, total U.S. ecommerce sales in 2021 still marked the highest on record. This is an impressive increase from a decade ago in 2011 when online sales in the U.S. totaled $199.3 billion. A year later, it breached the $200 billion mark for the very first time. From 2011 to 2021, annual U.S. ecommerce sales multiplied by nearly five times.
 

Target Market Size
 
Total Addressable Market
 
As an e-commerce company retailing in the U.S. market, our total addressable market covers all U.S. residents with Internet access, which segmentally includes repeat customers and new customers to online shopping every year.

Growth of E-commerce vs. Total Retail Sales
 
According to U.S. Department of Commerce data, e-commerce’s share of total retail sales has steadily been on the rise and peaked at 16.4% in the second quarter of 2020. Total U.S. retail sales increased 18% to $6.56 trillion in 2021 from $5.56 trillion in 2020. Consumers spent $960.15 billion online with U.S. merchants in 2021, which is around 14.63% of total U.S. retail sales for the year compared to 14.60% in 2020.
 
Amazon accounted for nearly 40% of all e-commerce in the United States and that makes Amazon the biggest ecommerce giant currently in the market.
 
Growth of Amazon Prime Members
 
In present, Amazon has approximately 200 million Prime Members in the U.S., and we were seeing continuous year-over-year growth over the past years.
 
Operational Advantages
 
According to Marketplace Pulse (dated January 17, 2023), Hour Loop is one of the top 10 third-party sellers on U.S. Amazon.
 
Automation
 
We developed a proprietary software that is tailor made to all our operational needs. This includes managing order review process, shipment managements, inventory management, accounting, and complete end-to-end third-party integrations. This allows us to scale, reduce cost, and improve quality.
Profitability Management
 
We have experienced operations managers tracking team performances with key performance indicators. We have departments specializing in logistic costs, advertising, marketing, and product management. We hold monthly process reviews to identify early red flags and look for areas to optimize. Each quarter we set increasingly difficult bars both to grow gross margin and further reduce expenses.
Continuous Process Optimization
 
In order to improve operating efficiencies, we have effective process optimization adapting to the changing policies of the e-commerce marketplace. We continuously analyze our performance based on data. We conduct pricing, inventory planning and profitability analysis using this data. This analysis provides us with insights on the processes that add the most value. Using these insights, we develop guidelines that help us improve our operations. These guidelines are incorporated into our operations which include (but are not limited to), identifying and ordering at optimal inventory levels, managing merchandise storage costs, optimizing transit times, and pricing at appropriate levels. Our operations staff follows these guidelines which help them perform optimally. By continuously analyzing data, we are able to find insights for improving our business. This drives continuous process optimization and its implementation into our operations. In addition, our proprietary software allows us to continually accelerate process effectiveness based on specific requirements. Over time, our system eliminates unnecessary procedures that could be replaced by an advanced algorithm. For instance, we simplify the FBA shipment process through application programming interface (“API”) integration. Our self-developed system also tracks insightful analysis of our profitability, clearer visualizes the drivers and optimums to better manage operational costs. We monitor operational parameters that drive our business and proactively try to optimize them. These include fine tuning our item selection, managing our inventory levels, estimating demand and pricing to maximize our profitability.
 
Data-Driven Approach
 
We make decisions based on analysis and interpretation of the data sets rather than observations over the market trend. By standardizing processes and combine data-driven management, we can ensure the organization maintains consistency that is high quality. Our business managers use historical data and sales projection provided by our proprietary software to find potential product gaps and keep products in stock all year round. This advantage enables powerful predictive insights in correlating real-time data with past sales patterns.

Training Programs
 
Our effective training programs accelerate employees’ professional development and enable the Company to hire new graduates or people without experience. Our training programs are very task-specific and we continually improve the materials in order to fit new industry needs. Other than the training material, we assign mentors to evaluate and monitor trainees’ performance at each stage of the training program.
Task Generalization
 
By generalizing each task with a standard process, we are able to shift assignments at regular intervals in order to find the most suitable employee for each specific task. Moreover, business managers are also able to rotate the vendors they manage easily. This allows our organization to effectively and consistently manage a vendor when a key employee who previously managed such vendor is no longer with the company. In addition, the task generalization allows the company to hire remote teams to further reduce labor costs.
Multicultural Management
 
We have a multicultural management team that is linguistically and culturally diverse in order to make judgments from different perspectives. Our remote teams in Taiwan and the Philippines provide diverse professional insights on specific tasks.
 
Technological advantages
 
Our software architecture was designed from the ground up to be scalable, secured, and easily extensible. By using JRuby on Rails, we can make use the best parts of Java, Ruby, and Rails without paying for their disadvantages. For example, we can use the massive collections of Java library, portability, speed, multi-threading, and maturity, but we do not have to be tied down with verbose code and strict typing. Rails allow us to quickly build web pages and integrate both the frontend and the backend. The application runs on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and can be easily scaled up to as many hosts as needed. It is accessible from a browser, so there is no need to setup or install anything on the client-side.
 
Cost Advantage
 
Access to Low Product Costs
 
We lower our product average costs by direct import items that have high volume, purchasing in bulk with better prices, and negotiating discounts or rebates over increased purchase volume every year. Our strong growth of purchase every year allows us to negotiate better discounts than the rivals. Therefore, we have the cost advantages to compete at low prices.
Efficient Processes and Technologies
 
Our proprietary software allows us to tailor make tools based on our specific use cases and leverage technologies to greatly reduce manual operations. We also saved the expense of using third-party software in managing inventory, orders, product listings, and especially the advertising analytic tool.
 
Low Distribution and Logistic costs
 
We saved the cost of managing the warehouse, shipping, and product distribution as we are enrolled in Amazon’s FBA program. The program allows us to reduce fixed costs of the physical assets and quickly scale up the business without thinking much about infrastructure complexity. Apart from using the FBA program, we also use FedEx, Amazon partnered carrier, Amazon Freight, and Amazon Global Logistics to reduce expense. The competitive shipping rates we secured provide us a cost-efficient way to deliver shipments from overseas and domestic to Amazon warehouse.

Efficiently Managed Operations
 
We have a good management structure within the firm and a data-driven system that allows employees to manage tasks quickly and cost-efficiently.
 
Reduced Labor Costs
 
We leverage third-party logistic companies to forward or prep our shipments to Amazon, which reduces our logistic operation labor costs. We also work with a labor outsourcing partner located in the Philippines that provides virtual assistants to help us with data entry and repetitive work, which is a very cost-effective way to do a lot of grunt work.
 
Key Competitors by Market Size/Share
 
Our key competitor is Amazon Retail. Amazon Retail frequently buys from the same brands we sell and sells them at a loss. Amazon Retail offers can be identified by the “Sold by Amazon” tag on Amazon’s site, and they are formed by two components: (i) Amazon Vendor Central, and (ii) the Sold by Amazon (“SBA”) program. We do not consider other third-party sellers as key competitors, because none of them represents enough market share to influence sales outcome. The addressable market is incredibly vast; thus we believe there are plenty of opportunities for everyone.
 
Amazon Vendor Central
 
Amazon Vendor Central allows manufacturers and brand owners to sell directly to Amazon as a first-party seller. This is one of the key competitive factors as Amazon usually buys bulk from the brands and sells at a very low price, which leads to hyper-competitive pricing. On pricing control, Amazon does not always follow the minimum advertised pricing (“MAP”) guidelines from manufacturers, which also puts us at a disadvantage when selling the same products.
Sold by Amazon Program
 
With the rise of e-commerce platforms, Amazon is looking for opportunities to attract customers away from its retail store rivals. In 2019, Amazon rolled out its new SBA program to help sellers grow their business. This program gives brand owners the control of inventory management and listings with Amazon having the authority to constantly monitor and change the price to make sure customers are getting the best deals. Once the products are enrolled in the SBA program, Amazon will set the minimum gross proceeds (“MGP”) to pay sellers the lowest possible amount on each unit sold. This new program is another threat to our company as Amazon is the one taking control of pricing, and they set the price very low in order to compete with competitors’ low price strategy.
Competitor Strengths and Weaknesses
 
Strengths of Sold by Amazon
 
First, ship from and SBA creates competition for potential customers who prefer to buy products from Amazon rather than a third-party seller. Secondly, Amazon monitors and manages pricing which makes the product price range at a highly competitive level. In fact, the chance of Amazon winning buy box is even higher as they have the best deal for customers. Finally, Amazon is not restricted by its policy to third-party sellers. One of the critical policies is the restock limit. Amazon limits certain items’ restock quantities based on recent sales activity, and this affects the in-stock rate of popular items that needs a greater volume.

Weaknesses of Sold by Amazon
 
As Amazon focuses on sales more than relationships with vendors, they do not follow vendors’ MAP strictly. We believe this has led to the devaluation of brands and will have a negative impact on building a long-term relationship with the vendors. Once the vendor hands over their price control to Amazon, we believe it is unlikely for them to sell at their original target price further, and it influences their offline sales. And in fact, it makes a huge difference in profitability to both Amazon and the vendor when reacts to the competitive pricing changes.
 
Apart from the weaknesses of business relationships, we believe Amazon also has disadvantages in the niche marketplaces, where product offerings are narrower and more personalized. As a third-party seller, we cooperate with vendors in developing custom projects that bring product differentiation and scarcity effect. However, we believe Amazon only concentrates on the masses, which gives them the deficiency of having products that are targeted in certain market segments.
 
Potential Substitute Products Posing Credible Threat to Company Products
 
No potential substitute products would pose a credible threat to our company as we have developed a wide product diversification.
 
As a company that focuses on reselling wholesale products, we have the resilience to find substitution of products or brands. We established product diversification by managing wide range of SKUs and continually expand our product categories. Our business strategy allows us to mitigate risk and generate significant profit by selling low volumes items diversified across a large variety of products.
 
In contrast, private labels sellers manage small number of SKUs that have large volumes in return with higher profit per unit. However, private labels have much higher risk when experiencing stagnant or declining sales as they would have lower capability to find sales replacements that are already established.
 
Strength of Barriers to Entry
 
Higher Capital, Low Margin: Selling online is generally low margin, but it requires high capital investment in order to purchase goods and run advertising.
 
Product Differentiation: Our proprietary software allows us to manage a huge number of SKUs. This allows us to participate in profitable long-tail products in addition to well-known popular ones. The turnover rate for long-tail products is slow, so newcomers are not likely to enter. It also requires a sophisticated system to manage. Furthermore, vendor relationships do not happen overnight.
 
Advanced System: We have already developed a highly sophisticated system which has been refined over time to become highly effective. Even if a new entrant has a team of the best software engineers in the world, it will still take them many years to refine their system. There is a myriad of intricacies as to the effectiveness of a system. Even if the new entrants have the system built, it will still take them years to collect historical sales data. By the time new entrants have done all that, our system would have continued to mature. This means we would be able to manage more SKUs more profitably with lower costs.
 
Risk of Entry- Potential Entrants
 
Vendor Vertical Integration: A vendor may forward integrate into the e-commerce marketplace in order to directly engage with their online customers.
 
Multichannel E-commerce: There is a chance of established online retail firms such as sellers on eBay, Walmart, and Etsy expanding their business to the Amazon marketplace.
 
Brick-and-Mortar: As the online retail is growing and offline retail is contracting, there are more brick-and-mortar stores migrating from offline to online.

Improving Sales of Popular Items and Securing the Inventories Without Paying Higher Storage Fees By Engaging the Services of Third Party Warehouses
 
As a retailer, our success is heavily influenced by the inventory control of our suppliers (vendors). However, many of our suppliers are having difficulties to maintain their stock level due to various reasons, such as the shortage of shipping containers, lack of labor, or disruption in manufacturing. The situation exacerbates during the pandemic and in peak season. In order to secure the inventories, we start to order large quantities of popular items or buying them out to store in the Amazon fulfillment center. However, the monthly storage fee of the Amazon fulfillment center in peak season (Q4) is 3.5 times higher than normal season, which puts pressure on our profits. To maintain the balance of inventory level and margins, we are currently contracting the warehousing services of third-party warehouses, including, Rahl Distribution, Inc., Rite Prep Shipping, 3Plzen, Carolina Prep & Ship, and Shenzhen Linkhub Co., Ltd to support our overall stock planning process. By doing this, we can improve sales by preventing popular items from going out of stock, since we had secured adequate inventories ahead of time. Furthermore, we can also avoid paying higher Amazon storage fees in Q4.
Growth Objectives
 
In 2022, we grew the number of vendors to more than 700, the number of business managers to almost 80, and the number of total employees to almost 200. In 2023, however, in light of the fact that many economists and business leaders had a pessimistic outlook, we are not looking for tremendous growth in 2023. Instead, we will aim to generate consistent profits and maintain cash flow as we become much more selective on product purchasing. We also expect product costs to go down and competitions to ease. We anticipate that our headcounts will go down slightly through attrition.
Market and Supplier Development - Establishing a Vendor Acquisition Team
 
In 2022, in order to continue growing at a rapid pace, we established a vendor acquisition team dedicated to onboarding new vendors to drastically improve our vendor acquisition success rate. This team specialized in the skills required to convince vendors to sell us their goods. Currently, this is being done by individual business managers with varying skill levels. The objective of the vendor acquisition team is to onboard 150 vendors per year and to increase our product range as well as diversifying our product categories. The team onboarded 133 vendors in 2022. Our vendor acquisition strategy for 2023 is to focus on experienced vendors with more product selections, and the goal is to improve gross margin. For categories with high return rates such as apparel, the minimum margin requirement would be even higher.
 
COVID-19
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) as a pandemic. This COVID-19 outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In response to this COVID-19 outbreak, the governments of many countries, states, cities, and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes. The Company’s services, operating results and financial performance could be adversely affected by the overall impacts of the pandemic. Management has determined that there is no material uncertainty that casts substantial doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. It is expected that COVID-19 might have some impact, though it is not anticipated to be significant.
 
Bank of America Loan
 
On June 18, 2019, the Company issued a Promissory Note (the “BofA Note”) in the amount of $785,000 to Bank of America (the “Lender”) for a loan in the amount of $785,000. The BofA Note bears interest at a rate of 8.11% per annum. The monthly payment is $15,963, consisting of $11,398 of principal and $4,565 of interest. The principle amount of $785,000 was paid in full on December 15,2020, while the accrued interest of $27,996 was still outstanding as of December 31, 2022.

Taishin International Bank
 
On August 18, 2022, Flywheel, signed a line of credit agreement in the amount of $6,940,063 with Taishin International Bank (“Taishin”). The line of credit did not change, what changed is the amount we can further borrow and it matures on August 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance under the Taishin line of credit was $652,316, and bears interest at a rate of 2.6% per annum. Also, Flywheel has accrued interest expense of $1,440 as of December 31, 2022.
 
PPP Loan
 
On April 7, 2020, the Company issued a promissory note (the “PPP Note”) in the amount of $27,012 under the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) to JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the “Lender”). The PPP, established as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was enacted on March 27, 2020, provides for loans to qualifying businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of the average monthly payroll expenses of the qualifying business. The PPP Note was set to mature on April 7, 2022, and bore interest at a rate of 0.98% per annum, payable monthly commencing October 5, 2020, following an initial deferral period as specified under the PPP loan. The PPP Note could be prepaid at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (the “Flexibility Act”), signed on June 5, 2020, amended certain provisions of the PPP, including the deferral period and repayment terms. The Flexibility Act extends the deferral period of payments of PPP loan principal, interest, and fees to the date when the U.S. Small Business Administration makes a final decision on the borrower’s application for forgiveness, or 10 months after the last day of the covered period if a borrower has not applied for forgiveness (whichever is earlier). This extension applies regardless of the terms of the PPP and does not require an amendment of the PPP. As such, the Company did not make any payments on the PPP Note during 2020.
 
Under the terms of the PPP loan, up to the entire amount of principal and accrued interest may be forgiven to the extent PPP loan proceeds are used for qualifying expenses as described in the CARES Act and applicable implementing guidance issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration under the PPP loan. On May 6, 2021, the entire amount of principal and accrued interest on the PPP Note was forgiven.

HOUR LOOP, INC.
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 December 31, 2022 and 2021



NOTE 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 
Hour Loop, Inc. (“Hour Loop” or the “Company”) is a technology-enabled consumer products company that uses machine learning and data analytics to design, develop, market and sell products. Hour Loop predominantly operates through online retail channels such as Amazon, Walmart, and Hourloop.com. The Company, as an Internet marketplace seller, sells products in multiple categories, including home/garden décor, toys, kitchenware, apparels, and electronics. The Company has only one segment, which is online retail (e-commerce).
 
The Company was incorporated on January 13, 2015 under the laws of the state of Washington. On April 7, 2021, the Company was converted from a Washington corporation to a Delaware corporation.
 
In 2019, Hour Loop formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Flywheel Consulting Ltd. (“Flywheel”) located in Taiwan, to provide business operating consulting services, exclusively to Hour Loop.
 
Reorganization - On June 30, 2021, the Company completed a corporate reorganization to convert its status from a S corporation (10,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding) to a C corporation (10,000,000 common shares issued and outstanding) with an effective date of July 27, 2021. The reorganization did not change the ownership of the Company and the each of the two stockholders (Sam Lai and Maggie Yu) continues to own 50% of the Company’s outstanding shares. The discussion and presentation of the audited consolidated financial statements herein assumes the reorganization had become effective as of the beginning of the first period presented in the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Consistent with Section 1362 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the retained earnings as of July 27, 2021 were distributed to the S corporation stockholders. The stockholders and the Company have entered into an agreement for this amount to be loaned to the Company. The amount of this distribution is $4,170,418 and the annual interest rate is %. The loan was due on December 31, 2022. On December 28, 2022, the Company, Mr. Lai and Ms. Yu agreed to extend the term of the loan, with the new maturity date of December 31, 2024. As amended, the annual interest rate on the loan is 5.5%.
 
On September 27, 2021, the Company completed a stock split such that each outstanding stock was sub-divided and converted into 4.44 shares of common stock. As result of the stock split, the total number of shares outstanding became 44,400,000.
 
On December 3, 2021, the Company completed a reverse stock split such that each outstanding stock was sub-divided and converted into 0.75 shares of common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, the total number of shares outstanding became 33,300,000. These shares were retrospectively adjusted for prior periods.
 
Basis of Presentation - The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).
 
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hour Loop and Flywheel. All material inter-company accounts and transactions were eliminated in consolidation.
 
Foreign Currency and Currency Translation - The assets and liabilities of Flywheel, having a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at period-end, with resulting translation gains or losses included within other comprehensive income or loss. Revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average monthly rates of exchange in effect during each period. All of the Company’s foreign operations use their local currency as their functional currency. Currency gains or losses resulting from transactions executed in currencies other than the functional currency are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations and other comprehensive income.
 
The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through its foreign subsidiary in Taiwan, which reports its earnings in Taiwan dollars. The Company translates the foreign assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date and translates the revenues and expenses using average rates during the year. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statements of operations. The Company does not hedge foreign currency translation risk in the net assets and income reported from these sources.
 
Going Concern Consideration
 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had a negative cash flow from operating activities of 11,603,176, and net loss of 1,477,623. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, the Company may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in normal course of business.
 
Most of the borrowings of the Company as of December 31, 2022 are from the related parties, which will not repayable within the next 12 months and are subject to renewal and the management is confident that these borrowings can be renewed upon expiration.
 
In order to strengthen the Company’s liquidity in the foreseeable future, the Company has taken the following measures:
 

i. | Taking various cost control measures to tighten the costs of operations. 
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | Implementing various strategies to enhance sales and profitability. 

 
Management represents that there is sufficient working capital to sustain operations longer than twelve months.

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
 
Significant estimates, but not limited to, estimates associated with the collectability of allowance for accounts receivable, accounts receivable, useful life of Property and equipment, impairment long lived assets, valuation allowance for Deferred tax assets and inventory valuation.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value. Our cash and cash equivalents are saved in the bank and covered by FDIC, which subjected applicable limits. Deposits are insured up to at least $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category.
 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Accounts receivable are stated at historical cost less allowance for doubtful accounts. On a periodic basis, management evaluates its accounts receivable and determines whether to provide an allowance or if any accounts should be written off based on a past history of write-offs, collections and current credit conditions. A receivable is considered past due if the Company has not received payments based on agreed-upon terms. The Company generally does not require any security or collateral to support its receivables. The collection is primarily through Amazon and collection period is usually less than 7 days. The Company performs on-going evaluations of its customers and maintains an allowance for bad and doubtful receivables. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not deem it necessary to have an allowance for bad debt or doubtful accounts.
 
Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold - The Company’s inventory consists mainly finished goods. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined on a first-in first-out basis. The Company’s costs include the amounts it pays manufacturers for product, tariffs and duties associated with transporting product across national borders, and freight costs associated with transporting the product from its manufacturers to its warehouses, as applicable. The merchandise with terms of FOB shipping point from vendors was recorded as the inventory-in-transit when inventory left the shipping dock of the vendors but not yet reached the receiving dock of the Company. Management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to merchandise inventory.

The “Cost of revenues” line item in the consolidated statements of operations is principally inventory sold to customers during the reporting period. The Company had inventory allowance balances of $842,263 and $184,720 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Full inventory allowance is recorded for the inventory SKU not sold for more than one year.
 
Rules for inventory allowance:
   Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.    Property and Equipment - Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method. The Company elected to expense any individual property and equipment items under $2,500.
 
The majority of the Company’s property and equipment is computers, and the estimated useful lives is  years.
 
Leases - Leases are classified at lease commencement date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease is a finance lease if it meets any of the following criteria: (a) the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term. (b) the lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (c) the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset, (d) the present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset or (e) the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. When none of the foregoing criteria is met, the lease shall be classified as an operating lease.   For a lessee, a lease is recognized as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding liability at lease commencement date. The lease liability is calculated at the present value of the lease payments not yet paid by using the lease term and discount rate determined at lease commencement. The right-of-use asset is calculated as the lease liability, increased by any initial direct costs, and prepaid lease payments, reduced by any lease incentives received before lease commencement. The right-of-use asset itself is amortized on a straight-line basis unless another systematic method better reflects how the underlying asset will be used by and benefits the lessee over the lease term.   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and has since issued amendments thereto, related to the accounting for leases (collectively referred to as “ASC 842”). ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. As of January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases, which allows the Company to apply the transition provision at the Company’s adoption date instead of at the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. Therefore, the Company recognized and measured leases existing at January 1, 2019 but without retrospective application. In addition, the Company elected the optional practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance which allows the Company to carry forward the historical accounting treatment for existing leases upon adoption. No impact was recorded to the beginning retained earnings for ASC Topic 842. The Company’s accounting policy is to recognize lease payments as lease expense for short-term leases of less than 12 months. 
Fair Value Measurement - Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, due to related parties and Short-term debt approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.
 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
 

i. | Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ii. | Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
iii. | Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. 

 
Revenue Recognition - The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC Topic 606”). The Company adopted ASC Topic 606 as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not affect the Company’s consolidated financial position, or cash flows. There were no changes to the timing of revenue recognition as a result of the adoption.
 
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provided a five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers as follows:
 

● | Identify the contract with a customer. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 
● | Determine the transaction price. 
● | Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. 
● | Recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied. 

 
The Company derives its revenue from the sale of consumer products. The Company sells its products directly to consumers through online retail channels. The Company considers customer order confirmations to be a contract with the customer. Customer confirmations are executed at the time an order is placed through third-party online channels. For all of the Company’s sales and distribution channels, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (i.e., when the Company’s performance obligation is satisfied), which typically occurs at shipment date. As a result, the Company has a present and unconditional right to payment and record the amount due from the customer in accounts receivable.
 
The Company evaluated principal versus agent considerations to determine whether it is appropriate to record platform fees paid to Amazon as an expense or as a reduction of revenue. Platform fees are recorded as sales and distribution expenses and are not recorded as a reduction of revenue because the Company as principal owns and controls all the goods before they are transferred to the customer. The Company can, at any time, direct Amazon, similarly, other third-party logistics providers (“Logistics Providers”), to return the Company’s inventories to any location specified by the Company. It is the Company’s responsibility to make any returns made by customers directly to Logistics Providers and the Company retains the back-end inventory risk. Further, the Company is subject to credit risk (i.e., credit card chargebacks), establishes prices of its products, can determine who fulfills the goods to the customer (Amazon or the Company) and can limit quantities or stop selling the goods at any time. Based on these considerations, the Company is the principal in this arrangement.
 
The customer can return the products within 30 days after the products are delivered and estimated sales returns are calculated based on the expected returns. The rates of sales returns were 5.78% and 4.92% of gross sales for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

From time to time, the Company offers price discounts on certain selected items to stimulate the sales of those items. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration for which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. Consistent with this policy, the Company reduces the amount of these discounts from the gross revenue to calculate the net revenue recorded on the statement of operations. 
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good to the customer and is the unit of account in ASC Topic 606. A contract’s transaction price is recognized as revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied. Each of the Company’s contracts have a single distinct performance obligation, which is the promise to transfer individual goods. For consumer product sales, the Company has elected to treat shipping and handling as fulfillment activities, and not a separate performance obligation. The Company had shipping and handling costs of $21,145,605 and $11,756,555 for the periods ended of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were recorded in selling, advertising and marketing expenses. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for its single performance obligation related to product sales at the time control of the merchandise passes to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. The Company bills customers for charges for shipping and handling on certain sales and such charges are recorded as part of net revenue.
 
For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products to be the only identified performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The Company’s revenues for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are recognized at a point in time.
 
Income Taxes - Prior to 2021, the Company, with the stockholders’ consent, elected to be taxed as an “S corporation” under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and comparable state income tax law. As an S corporation, the Company was generally not subject to corporate income taxes, and the Company’s net income or loss is reported on the individual tax return of the stockholders of the Company. On July 27, 2021, the Company’s tax status changed to a C corporation. Per ASC 740-10-45-19, when deferred tax accounts are recognized or derecognized as required by paragraphs 740-10-25-32 and 740-10-40-6 due to a change in tax status, the effect of recognizing or derecognizing the deferred tax liability of asset shall be included in income from continuing operations.
 
The Company also complied with state tax code, including California franchise tax. Management has evaluated its tax positions and has concluded that the Company had taken no uncertain tax positions that could require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements to comply with provisions set forth in ASC section 740, Income Taxes.
 
Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. 
Presentation of Sales Taxes - Governmental authorities impose sales tax on all of the Company’s sales to nonexempt customers. The Company collects sales tax from customers and remits the entire amount to the governmental authorities. The Company’s accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted from revenues and cost of revenues.
 
The Company makes an assessment of sales tax payable including any related interest and penalties and accrues these estimated on the financial statements. Pursuant to the Wayfair decision, each state enforced sales tax collection at different dates. The company collects and remits sales tax in accordance with the state regulations. The Company estimates that as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, it owed $288,466 and $620,963, respectively, in sales taxes along with penalties and interest resulting from late filing.
 
Concentrations of Risks - Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash with various domestic and foreign financial institutions of high credit quality. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of all of the aforementioned institutions.

The Company’s accounts receivables are derived from sales contracts with a large number of customers. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses on customer accounts when deemed necessary. Significant customers are those which represent more than 10% of the Company’s total net revenue or gross accounts receivable balance at the balance sheet date. During the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no customer that accounted for 10% or more of total net revenues. In addition, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no customer that accounted for 10% or more of gross accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, all of the Company’s accounts receivable were held by the Company’s sales platform agent, Amazon, which collects money on the Company’s behalf from its customers. Therefore, the Company’s accounts receivable are comprised of receivables due from Amazon and the reimbursement from Amazon to the Company usually takes 15 to 20 days.
 
The Company’s business is reliant on one key vendor which currently provides the Company with its sales platform, logistics and fulfillment operations, including certain warehousing for the Company’s net goods, and invoicing and collection of its revenue from the Company’s end customers. During the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 100% of the Company’s revenue was through or with the Amazon sales platform.
 
Selling and Marketing – Selling, advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35. Among these, advertising and promotion expenses were $3,539,946 and $2,382,148 for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
General and Administrative - General and administrative expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 720-35.
 
Commitments and Contingencies - Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.
 
Related Parties - The Company accounts for related party transactions in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 850 (Related Party Disclosures). A party is considered to be related to the Company if the party directly or indirectly or through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. A party which can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or if it has an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests is also a related party.
 
Earnings per Share - The Company computes basic earnings per common share using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For the period in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to stockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were no dilutive securities or other items that would affect EPS for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Therefore, the diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share.
 
Share issuance for Stock Compensation - Compensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. 
 
Long lived assets- In accordance with ASC 360-10-35-17, if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group (in use or under development) is evaluated and found not to be fully recoverable (the carrying amount exceeds the estimated gross, undiscounted cash flows from use and disposition), then an impairment loss must be recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the asset’s (or asset group’s) fair value. The Company did not record any impairment charges for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
