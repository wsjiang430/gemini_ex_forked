 Our founders and inspirations
 We are founded on the legacies of leading vaccine developers who inspire us to build a company to benefit human health on a global scale. Our late co-founder, Dr. Tadataka “Tachi” Yamada, championed vaccines as a powerful means to address health inequities and equalize opportunity for people around the world. As the former Chief Medical and Scientific Officer at Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda Pharmaceuticals), Tachi helped establish Takeda Pharmaceuticals’ vaccine pipeline, which included the most advanced norovirus vaccine candidate in clinical development. Through his most recent role as a venture partner at Frazier Healthcare Partners (Frazier), he helped Frazier and Takeda Pharmaceuticals launch their third collaboration, HilleVax, to continue the development of this novel norovirus vaccine candidate, HIL-214 (formerly TAK-214). At HilleVax, we aim to continue Tachi’s mission of improving global health with a sense of urgency by always putting patients first.
 Our work, and company name itself, is also inspired by Dr. Maurice Hilleman. Dr. Hilleman is considered by many to be the father of modern vaccines. He developed many of the vaccines that are routinely recommended for children today. By the end of his career, Dr. Hilleman had played a key role in developing more than forty vaccines, including those for the flu, chickenpox, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, meningococcus, measles, mumps, rubella, and other diseases. These vaccines are estimated to save millions of lives every year. We are honored that his daughter, Jeri Hilleman, serves on our Board of Directors.
 We aim to have a global impact on human health and believe the best way to achieve this goal is by developing novel vaccines for severe and life-threatening diseases. HIL-214 is our foundational vaccine candidate from which we are building our company. We are honored to continue Dr. Yamada’s and Dr. Hilleman’s legacies through the further development of HIL-214 and other potential vaccine candidates.
 Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel vaccines. Our initial program, HIL-214, is a virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccine candidate for the prevention of moderate-to-severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by norovirus infection. It is estimated that norovirus causes nearly 700 million cases of illness and more than 200,000 deaths worldwide per year, as well as significant additional economic and social burden. To date, HIL-214 has been studied in nine clinical trials conducted by Takeda Vaccines, Inc. (Takeda) and its predecessor, LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LigoCyte), which collectively generated safety data from more than 4,500 subjects and immunogenicity data from more than 2,200 subjects, including safety and immunogenicity data from more than 800 pediatric subjects. A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b field efficacy trial enrolled 4,712 adult subjects, and HIL-214 was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical proof of concept in preventing moderate-to-severe cases of AGE from norovirus infection. In September 2021, an open investigational new drug application (IND) was transferred to us from Takeda, under which we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial, NEST-IN1 (Norovirus Efficacy and Safety Trial in Infants, or NOR-212), in May 2022 to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of HIL-214 in infants. In May 2022, we completed enrollment of the prespecified 200 subject run-in for NEST-IN1. We resumed enrollment in NEST-IN1 in August 2022, following the prespecified safety assessment by the clinical trial's data monitoring committee. In December 2022, we reported positive interim immunogenicity results for the first 200 subjects of NEST-IN1. We expect to report top-line safety and clinical efficacy data in the first quarter of 2024. We believe HIL-214 has the potential to be the first ever vaccine approved for norovirus-related illness.
 Norovirus is the most common cause of viral AGE worldwide and is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, and, sometimes, fever that may lead to clinically significant dehydration. The global cost of norovirus-caused AGE is estimated to be over $4 billion in direct health system costs and approximately $60 billion in societal costs per year. In the United States alone, norovirus-caused AGE is estimated to result in $2 billion in direct medical costs and $10 billion in societal costs per year. While norovirus can cause illness in any age group, the majority of deaths and illnesses due to norovirus are borne by young children and older adults. In children younger than four years of age, norovirus is estimated to cause 95,000 deaths and 450 million illnesses globally each year. Almost all children will experience at least one norovirus infection by the age of five. In the United States, this results in approximately 627,000 outpatient visits, 281,000 emergency room visits and 14,000 hospitalizations each year for children under the age of five. Older adults are also vulnerable to severe norovirus infection given their higher rate of comorbidities, especially if they live in settings conducive to outbreaks, such as assisted living facilities. For adults older than 55 years of age, norovirus is estimated to cause 78,000 deaths and 81 million illnesses globally each year. In the United States, older adults are estimated to

account for 17% of illnesses due to norovirus yet comprise 52% of hospitalizations and 94% of deaths. There are currently no approved vaccines or antiviral therapies for either the prevention or treatment of norovirus-related illness.
 In July 2021, Takeda granted us, among other things, an exclusive license (the Takeda License) under certain intellectual property to develop and commercialize HIL-214 (formerly TAK-214) worldwide (excluding Japan) in exchange for upfront consideration as well as future cash milestones and royalties on net sales. Takeda will retain commercialization rights in Japan, and we will integrate certain Japan development activities into our global development plan. As of March 1, 2023, our intellectual property portfolio for HIL-214 includes 23 issued U.S. patents, including eight issued U.S. composition and formulation patents covering HIL-214 and components thereof, all of which are licensed to us under the Takeda License.
 HIL-214 is a bivalent (containing two proteins) vaccine candidate consisting of VLPs representing two common genotypes of norovirus and is co-formulated with an aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant, which is commonly used in adult and pediatric vaccines to enhance immunogenicity. Alum may also improve the stability of VLPs in solution. VLPs are self-assembling structures that mimic the unique and repetitive geometric features that characterize the surface of a live virus. VLPs can be produced in a wide range of expression systems and can be readily manufactured at large scale. Importantly, VLPs lack a viral genome and can therefore neither replicate nor cause infection, which may present an important safety advantage over live vaccines. The genotypes represented by the two VLPs in HIL-214 are from the GI and GII genogroups of norovirus, which are responsible for the majority of human norovirus infection. VLP-based vaccines are well-characterized and include currently marketed vaccines, such as Gardasil, Cervarix, and Sci-B-Vac, and have been administered to millions of patients worldwide.
 HIL-214 has been extensively evaluated in nine Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials conducted by Takeda. Safety data generated across more than 4,500 subjects in these trials showed that HIL-214 was well tolerated across all age groups and had an adverse event (AE) profile similar to that of other approved alum-adjuvanted vaccines. In infants between six weeks and six months of age who received two doses of HIL-214, AEs were largely mild to moderate in intensity, with the most common reactions being fussiness (19-28%), drowsiness (16-21%), diarrhea (10-19%), and pain near the injection site (9-21%) in 180 subjects studied. In adults, systemic AEs were found to occur at a rate similar to placebo, with the most common local reaction being pain near the injection site (48% for HIL-214 vs. 38% for placebo) in a safety subset of 377 subjects. In addition, immunogenicity data has been collected in over 2,200 subjects. HIL-214 was found to induce antibody responses greater than eight-fold above baseline at least 28 days post vaccination against norovirus in all age groups. An extensive set of clinical dose finding and formulation studies were conducted to evaluate the immune response across age groups and between the two VLPs contained in HIL-214. In a clinical trial of military recruits, in which 4,712 subjects were administered HIL-214 or placebo, HIL-214 demonstrated an estimated 80% efficacy in preventing AGE caused by norovirus strains represented in our vaccine candidate and 62% efficacy for AGE caused by any norovirus strain (including those not represented in HIL-214) in the first 45 days post vaccination. We believe this trial demonstrated clinical proof of concept and protection against strains not included in the vaccine (i.e., heterotypic or cross-protection).
 Our near-term clinical development plan is focused on infants, a population in which norovirus is routinely circulating and infections are common. We initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial, NEST-IN1, in May 2022 to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of HIL-214 in infants. In May 2022, we completed enrollment of the prespecified 200 subject run-in for NEST-IN1. We resumed enrollment in NEST-IN1 in August 2022, following the prespecified safety assessment by the clinical trial's data monitoring committee. In December 2022, we reported positive interim immunogenicity results for the first 200 subjects of NEST-IN1. We expect to report top-line safety and clinical efficacy data for this trial in the first quarter of 2024. While Takeda previously conducted both Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of HIL-214, we have not previously completed any clinical trials. After conclusion of the Phase 2b trial in infants, we plan to proceed to a pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trial in infants. We believe that successful completion of these Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials, together with existing clinical data and additional co-administration trials with other common pediatric vaccines and lot-to-lot consistency trials, will support regulatory submissions for marketing approval in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other key markets. We also expect these data to be evaluated by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an advisory body of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which develops vaccine recommendations for children and adults in the United States. New pediatric vaccines that receive a preferred recommendation from ACIP are nearly universally adopted in the United States, with many reaching national immunization rates of over 90%. In addition, depending upon the results from our Phase 2b trial in infants, we also plan to initiate a series of trials to support the potential approval of HIL-214 for older children, adults, and older adults.
 The global vaccine market is estimated to be over $50 billion in 2020 and is expected to exceed $100 billion by 2027. While there are currently no approved vaccines for the prevention of norovirus-related illness, we believe there are market analogues that we can use to estimate the size of the commercial opportunity for HIL-214. In the pediatric market, we believe that rotavirus vaccines are the closest analogue to HIL-214. Rotavirus was the leading cause of pediatric viral AGE before the introduction of the rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix and RotaTeq. These vaccines, approved only in infants, are now widely adopted worldwide, with many countries achieving vaccination rates above 80% among one-year-olds.

Rotavirus vaccines generated approximately $1.5 billion in global sales in 2021. In the older adult market, we believe that Shingrix, a vaccine developed by GlaxoSmithKline to prevent shingles, is an analogue for HIL-214 due to the similarities in morbidity, mortality and economic burden between shingles and norovirus each before the introduction of a vaccine. Shingrix generated $2.3 billion in sales in 2021. Furthermore, we believe that there is a commercial opportunity in other groups at high risk for norovirus infection, such as healthcare workers, immunocompromised individuals, military personnel, food handlers, and travelers, including cruise ship passengers.
 Our pipeline
 The following chart summarizes our current development programs.
 
Our strategy
 Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of novel vaccines. Our strategy is initially focused on the development and commercialization of HIL-214 as the first potential vaccine for the prevention of AGE caused by norovirus infection. Key elements of this strategy include:
 •Advance the clinical development of HIL-214 for the prevention of norovirus-caused AGE in infants. We are leveraging the extensive clinical data as well as our management team’s vaccine development experience to advance HIL-214 through Phase 2b and 3 clinical trials in infants. We believe that initial development of HIL-214 in infants will de-risk its advancement given the endemic nature of disease in this population, which allows for rapid case accrual, and the lack of pre-existing immunity to norovirus, which may enhance the ability to show the effect of a vaccine. We initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial, NEST-IN1, in May 2022 to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of HIL-214 in infants. In May 2022, we completed enrollment of the prespecified 200 subject run-in for NEST-IN1. We resumed enrollment in NEST-IN1 in August 2022, following the prespecified safety assessment by the clinical trial's data monitoring committee. In December 2022, we reported positive interim immunogenicity results for the first 200 subjects of NEST-IN1. We expect to report top-line safety and clinical efficacy data for this trial in the first quarter of 2024. Pending the successful completion of the ongoing NEST-IN1 trial in infants, we plan to proceed to a pivotal Phase 3 efficacy trial in infants.
 •Expand the development of HIL-214 to older populations and other high-risk groups. Given the vulnerability of older adults to norovirus infection, we plan to expand the development of HIL-214 to adults older than 60 years of age. We also plan to expand the development of HIL-214 to older children and adults to cover other high-risk populations such as healthcare workers, immunocompromised individuals, military personnel, food handlers, and travelers, including cruise ship passengers.
 •Commercialize HIL-214 in the United States. We plan to independently commercialize HIL-214, if approved, in the United States by building a highly-targeted sales force to support the adoption of HIL-214. We also plan to seek a preferred recommendation from ACIP to facilitate the broad uptake of HIL-214.
 •Seek commercial partnerships to maximize the HIL-214 opportunity outside of the United States. We believe there is a significant global commercial opportunity for HIL-214. To address geographies outside of the 


United States, we plan to seek one or more partners with existing commercial infrastructure and expertise in these markets.
 •Pursue expansion strategies for HIL-214. We plan to support alternative formulations or combinations where there is clear unmet need, clinical rationale, and commercial justification. We also plan to further expand the breadth of coverage for our norovirus vaccine through the addition of new norovirus strains to cover relevant or emerging genotypes as needed.
 •In-license or acquire additional products or technology platforms relevant to the prevention of other infectious diseases. We intend to take advantage of our management team’s vaccine expertise and extensive business development experience to opportunistically in-license or acquire additional innovative vaccines or technology platforms.
 Overview of norovirus
 Overview
 Norovirus is the most common cause of viral AGE. AGE is characterized by acute-onset vomiting and diarrhea, typically lasting between one and three days, that may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, and fever. Most infections result in a full recovery, although severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death are more common among young children and older adults. Given that there are no antiviral therapies available to treat norovirus infections, clinical management is focused on supportive care to prevent dehydration and manage symptoms.
 The burden of norovirus falls disproportionately on young children and older adults. Incidence of norovirus is highest among young children, with 70% of cases in children under four years of age occurring between six months and two years of age. As a result, almost all children will have experienced at least one norovirus infection by the age of five. While incidence is lower among older adults, norovirus illnesses are more likely to result in lingering symptoms, hospitalization, and death in this population. Older adults are also more likely to be found in high risk settings for norovirus outbreaks, such as long-term care facilities and hospitals. Other high-risk groups for norovirus infection include healthcare workers, immuno-compromised individuals, military personnel, food handlers, and travelers, including cruise ship passengers. Globally, norovirus is estimated to result in over approximately 700 million cases of AGE and 200,000 deaths per year, resulting in over $4 billion in direct health system costs and $60 billion in societal costs per year. In the United States alone, norovirus is estimated to result in over 20 million cases of AGE, resulting in over $2 billion in direct medical costs, and $10 billion in indirect societal costs, per year. In addition, outbreaks of norovirus at restaurant chains, cruise ships, and in other industries have caused significant industry disruptions and reputational damage to the affected brands.
 
Genogroups and genotypes
 Noroviruses are a group of small, non-enveloped viruses belonging to the Caliciviridae family. Noroviruses contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that codes for seven nonstructural and two structural proteins. The first structural protein, VP1, encodes the major capsid protein. VP1 is further subdivided into the N-terminal, shell, and

protruding domains. The protruding domain of VP1 is present on the surface of viral particles and is necessary for binding to HBGAs on epithelial cells in the human gastrointestinal tract.
 Noroviruses are classified into ten genetic groups called genogroups. These genogroups, GI through GX, are based on amino acid diversity in the major capsid protein VP1. Genogroups GI and GII are responsible for the majority of human infections across major geographies worldwide, with GII accounting for an estimated 96% of global prevalence. Norovirus genogroups are further subdivided into at least 48 genotypes: 9 genotypes in GI, 26 genotypes in GII, and 13 genotypes in GIII through GX. A single genotype, GII.4, is estimated to be responsible for nearly two-thirds of norovirus outbreaks in both developed and developing countries. GII.4 has been the dominant genotype in circulation for the last two decades, and of the GII.4 strains, GII.4 Sydney 2012 has been the predominant variant detected worldwide since 2012. In addition to causing the majority of norovirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths were more likely in outbreaks associated with GII.4 viruses.
 
Norovirus attachment and entry
 Norovirus entry into host cells is a multi-step process. The first step is norovirus binding to attachment factors that concentrate the virus on the cell surface. The most well-characterized attachment factors are HBGAs. HBGAs are units of simple sugar that are bonded together, or oligosaccharides, found on the epithelia of the respiratory, genitourinary, and digestive tracts, as well as in body fluids such as blood and saliva. The interaction between norovirus and HBGAs is known to promote viral entry into host cells, and this interaction is supported by population genetics. Specifically, individuals with mutations in the FUT2 gene, which is required for secretion of HBGAs, are highly resistant to infection by GI.1 and most GII.4 norovirus strains. Approximately 20% of Caucasians lack a functional FUT2 gene. Given the importance of HBGAs for norovirus attachment and cell entry, measurement of HBGA-blocking antibodies is the primary functional method used to assess the immunogenicity of norovirus vaccine candidates. We believe that data from our ongoing and planned clinical trials of HIL-214 will help determine whether anti-HBGA antibodies are an appropriate surrogate for evaluating norovirus vaccine efficacy.
 The next step for norovirus entry is receptor engagement. Receptors are essential host factors that bind to the norovirus particle and actively promote entry into the cell. The receptor(s) for human norovirus are currently unknown. The last steps for norovirus entry are cell entry, or endocytosis, and uncoating, which results in release of the viral genome into the host cytoplasm. New norovirus particles are then produced and released via cell lysis, which results in inflammation of the stomach or intestines, the underlying pathology of AGE.



Clinical presentation and management
 Clinical presentation of norovirus infections can range widely, from asymptomatic infections to life-threatening dehydration and diarrhea. Asymptomatic cases are estimated to account for 30% of norovirus infections. For a symptomatic case, the illness typically begins after an incubation period of 12 to 48 hours and is characterized by acute-onset vomiting and diarrhea that may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, and fever. Other symptoms, including muscle pain, malaise, headache, and chills, can also occur. The duration of clinical symptoms is typically 12 to 72 hours in otherwise healthy individuals. The most serious complication is severe dehydration leading to hypovolemic shock, which occurs when the body loses more than one-fifth of its fluid supply. Hypovolemic shock makes it difficult for the heart to pump sufficient blood to the body and can lead to organ failure, coma, and death. Severe outcomes of acute AGE as a result of norovirus infection, such as hospitalization and death, are more likely among young children, older adults, and immunocompromised patients.
 There are currently no antiviral therapies available to treat norovirus infection. Clinical management is focused on supportive therapy to prevent dehydration. First line therapy is comprised of oral rehydration solutions, followed by intravenous rehydration for patients with profuse vomiting or worsening dehydration that could lead to hypovolemic shock. Medicines to relieve pain, nausea, or vomiting can also be used.
 Transmission and prevention
 Norovirus is highly transmissible, with as few as 18 viral particles needed to make a person sick. For context, a single gram of feces can contain up to 95 billion particles of norovirus. A systematic review of norovirus outbreak data in the United States from 2009-2017 reported a median R0 (a measure of the average number of people who will contract a viral disease from one infected person) of 2.75, but this number is likely to be a lower bound for norovirus globally given generally high sanitation rates and comparatively easy access to clean food and water in the United States compared to other nations with higher burden of norovirus infection. For context, seasonal strains of influenza in the United States tend to have R0 values between 1 and 2.
 There are three general modes of norovirus transmission: person-to-person, foodborne, and waterborne. Person-to-person transmission occurs mainly through the fecal-oral route and potentially through aerosolized vomitus. Viral shedding in stool can also occur before the onset of symptoms and continue up to eight weeks after a person has been infected, leading to secondary transmission rates, defined as the probability that some or all family members also become infected, of up to 30%. Person-to-person transmission can also occur indirectly through contaminated fomites, such as clothes and utensils, or through environmental surfaces. Foodborne transmission typically occurs by exposure to infected food handlers, although exposure to human waste further upstream in the food distribution system is also a possibility. For example, oysters filter ocean water through their bodies to get food and will absorb viral particulates when exposed to untreated human waste, which can make its way into ocean water in the case of leaky septic systems and/or

dysfunctional waste-water treatment plants. Waterborne transmission can occur through the failure to properly chlorinate municipal water or through the contamination of well water with human waste. Norovirus outbreaks can occur throughout the year, although increased activity is observed in the winter months.
 Preventing the spread of norovirus is challenging. The virus can persist on environmental surfaces such as utensils and countertops for up to two weeks. Norovirus can remain infectious on foods that are frozen and until heated above 140°F. Furthermore, alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not as effective at removing norovirus particles as washing hands with soap and water, and their use in place of hand washing is associated with a greater risk for norovirus outbreaks in long-term care facilities. This resistance to common disinfectants appears to be unique to norovirus, as there have not been similar reports of outbreaks associated with the use of hand sanitizers in lieu of handwashing for other common viruses. The CDC recommends four strategies to help prevent the transmission of norovirus: proper hand hygiene, safe food handling, isolation while sick, and surface decontamination. Hand hygiene with running water and soap is viewed as the most effective method to control norovirus transmission. Fruit and vegetables should be carefully washed before eating, and affected individuals should refrain from preparing food for others for up to two days after symptoms stop. Furthermore, kitchen surfaces and frequently touched objects should be sanitized using chlorine-based disinfectants such as bleach. In the event of an outbreak in a high transmission environment like a cruise ship, nursing home, daycare, or hospital ward, a full decontamination procedure must be performed in order minimize the risk of additional spread.
 Burden in young children
 Norovirus routinely circulates among young children, a mode of transmission categorized as endemic. Although norovirus can infect all age groups, the incidence of norovirus is highest among young children. The GII genogroup is the dominant source of infection in children, accounting for 96% of all sporadic infections, and the GII.4 genotype, in particular, accounts for 70% of detected genotypes. The consistent dominance of GII.4 in circulation over more than two decades, particularly among children, highlights the importance of vaccination efforts to be directed against this strain.
 Most infections are completely resolved, resulting in a full recovery, although severe outcomes such as hospitalization and death are more common among young children when considering global burden. In both high- and middle-income countries with mature rotavirus vaccination programs, norovirus is now the most common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis requiring medical care. In the United States, norovirus is estimated to result in 627,000 outpatient visits, 281,000 emergency room visits, and 14,000 hospitalizations each year for children under the age of five. Globally, norovirus is estimated to result in 450 million illnesses and 95,000 deaths annually for children under the age of four, resulting in a total societal cost of approximately $39 billion. In the United States alone, norovirus is estimated to result in 2.8 million illnesses annually in children under the age of four, resulting in a total societal cost of approximately $1.2 billion.
 For comparison, norovirus today has a similar morbidity, mortality, and economic burden in children as rotavirus did before the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. Prior to rotavirus vaccines becoming available, rotavirus was estimated to result in 2.7 million illnesses each year in children under the age of five in the United States, resulting in a total societal cost of approximately $1.5 billion. Today, rotavirus vaccines are estimated to avert 280,000 outpatient visits, 62,000 emergency room visits, and 45,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. When considering all age groups, the overall burden of norovirus is greater than that of rotavirus.
 Further, norovirus today has a greater morbidity, mortality, and economic burden than shingles did before the introduction of shingles vaccines. Prior to shingles vaccines becoming available, shingles was estimated to result in 1 million illnesses, 46,000 hospitalizations, and 80 deaths each year among adults over 50 years of age in the United States, for a total societal cost of $2.4 billion. In comparison, norovirus results in 22 million illnesses, 96,000 hospitalizations, and 1,350 deaths each year among all age groups in the United States, for a total societal cost of $10 billion.



Burden in older adults
 Adults older than 65 are another high-risk group for norovirus infections. In the United States, older adults are estimated to account for 17% of illnesses due to norovirus yet comprise 52% of hospitalizations and 94% of deaths. Symptoms are often more severe in this age group and include diarrhea lasting up to nine days and headache, thirst, and vertigo lasting up to 19 days. Older adults are also more likely to be found in certain settings vulnerable to norovirus outbreaks. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are the most commonly reported location for norovirus outbreaks, with an estimated 8 – 17% of LTCFs experiencing an outbreak each year. Hospitals are another common setting for norovirus outbreaks. After admittance to a hospital, older adults are more likely to acquire a norovirus infection than younger hospitalized patients. In the United States, norovirus is estimated to result in 3.7 million illnesses, 380,000 outpatient visits, 50,000 hospitalizations, and 1,250 deaths annually for adults over 65. Globally, norovirus is estimated to result in 81 million illnesses and 78,000 deaths annually for adults older than 55.
 Burden in other high-risk groups
 In addition to young children and older adults, there are other groups that are at high risk for norovirus infection. These include healthcare workers, immunocompromised individuals, military personnel, food handlers, and travelers, including cruise ship passengers. More than 100 outbreaks of norovirus have been described in military units since 1988, reducing operational effectiveness and staff availability for duties. Food handlers are another source of concern. Given the small amount of virus needed for infection, a single individual can be responsible for widespread virus transmission. For example, a norovirus outbreak in 2006 resulting in at least 350 gastroenteritis cases was linked to a single food handler. Another series of high-profile outbreaks occurred at Chipotle restaurants between 2015 and 2018, where 1,100 patrons fell ill after eating at various locations of the chain restaurant. This outbreak resulted in the largest fine in food safety in U.S. history. Travelers are another high-risk group, with more than 20% of travelers with diarrheal symptoms testing positive for norovirus. Cruise ships present a high risk of norovirus outbreaks due to their ideal conditions for transmission: common sources for food and drinks, a semi-closed environment, and older adult passengers that may be more vulnerable to infections and complications arising from gastroenteritis. Outbreaks on cruise ships can be quite severe with infection rates for passengers ranging from 19% to 74%. The CDC reported 84 outbreaks of norovirus on cruise ships between 2010 and 2019.
 Our solution: HIL-214
 HIL-214 is a bivalent vaccine candidate in development for the prevention of moderate-to-severe AGE caused by norovirus infection. HIL-214 consists of VLPs which are designed to mimic the structure of norovirus and are co-formulated with an alum adjuvant to enhance immunogenicity and stability of the VLPs in solution. HIL-214 is administered intramuscularly via prefilled syringes and has demonstrated stability at standard refrigeration temperatures of 4°C for 24 months.
 VLP technology
 VLPs are self-assembling structures that mimic the unique and repetitive geometric features that characterize the surface of a live virus. VLPs can be produced using a common range of expression systems, including bacterial, mammalian, or insect cells, and can present a conformationally correct representation of the virus capsid to the immune system. As a result, VLPs can be readily manufactured in cell culture at large scale and offer a highly immunogenic vaccine template.

Importantly, VLPs lack a viral genome and can therefore neither replicate nor cause infection, which may provide an important safety advantage over live vaccines.
 There is ample precedent for the development of safe and effective vaccines that leverage VLP technology. Gardasil, a commercially available vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV) developed by Merck, consists of recombinant VLPs self-assembled from the capsid protein of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. A subsequent iteration of the product, known as Gardasil9, added five additional VLPs to its formulation to cover HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. Other commercially available VLP vaccines include Cervarix, an HPV vaccine manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, and Sci-B-Vac, an HBV vaccine developed by VBI Vaccines. There are also a number of VLP vaccines in clinical development for H1N1, HIV, malaria, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and COVID-19, among other indications. Vaccines that employ VLP technology have been given to millions of patients worldwide.
 HIL-214 construct
 HIL-214 includes VLPs representing the two genogroups of norovirus responsible for the majority of human infection: GI and GII. Our G1.1 Norwalk VLP was selected based on its potential to promote a broad immune response to GI norovirus strains. In an independent study, infection of human volunteers with GI.1 Norwalk virus resulted in a broad antibody response against GI.1, GI.2, GI.3, and GI.4 strains. Our GII.4 VLP is a consensus sequence of three GII.4 strains that were responsible for major outbreaks in 2002 and 2006: GII.4 Houston/2002, GII.4 Yerseke/2006a, and GII.4 Den Haag/2006b. The GII.4 genotype accounts for two-thirds of norovirus outbreaks worldwide and its prevalence is attributed to its ability to rapidly evolve, with novel variants emerging every two to four years that may evade immunity in the human population. We believe that presenting epitopes from three GII.4 strains on our GII.4 VLP will result in a broader response to GII.4 strains than a VLP presenting a single strain. Sera from adult subjects vaccinated with HIL-214 have been shown to generate antibody titers against a broad range of GI and GII norovirus genogroups. Specifically, HIL-214 resulted in a greater than fourfold rise in antibodies against multiple GI strains (GI.1, GI.5, GI.6) and GII.4 strains (2002, 2006a, 2006b, 2009, 2012). The observation that HIL-214 induced antibodies against GII.4 strains that have emerged after the formulation of our vaccine candidate (GII.4 New Orleans 2009 and GII.4 Sydney 2012) suggests that our GII.4 VLP may protect against newly emerging strains in the future.
 HIL-214 also includes aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel 2% or alum) as an adjuvant. Alum is the predominant adjuvant used in human vaccines and is a common component of several pediatric vaccines, including those for pneumococcus, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP), Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B and HPV.



HIL-214 clinical data
 Overview
 HIL-214 has been the subject of nine Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials prior to the initiation of the NEST-IN1 trial, including more than 4,500 subjects of which more than 2,200 subjects have been evaluated for immunogenicity. These subjects have ranged from 6 weeks to 102 years old. An overview of the clinical trials conducted to date by Takeda and its predecessor, LigoCyte Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is tabulated below:
 
Dose finding and formulation trials in infants and children
 A Phase 2 dose finding and formulation trial has been conducted in infants and children for HIL-214. Based on the results from this trial, in addition to considerations around disease burden and maternal antibody concentrations, we have selected the following dose and schedule to continue to evaluate HIL-214 in infants: two doses of 50/150 µg GI.1/GII.4

with 500 µg alum given at approximately 5 months of age at the time of the first dose. Further details on this trial are summarized below.
 NOR-202—A Phase 2 safety, immunogenicity, and dose finding trial of HIL-214 in infants and children between the ages of 6 weeks and 9 years old. The trial enrolled 840 subjects in Colombia, Panama, and Finland into two cohorts. The first cohort was aged 6 months to 9 years old and received one or two doses of one of four potential HIL-214 formulations containing either 15/15, 15/50, 50/50, or 50/150 µg of the GI.1/GII.4 VLP combination and 500 µg of alum at least 28 days apart. The second cohort was aged 6 weeks to 6 months old and received two or three doses of one of the four potential HIL-214 formulations. All dosages of HIL-214 were generally well tolerated with no AEs related to HIL-214 leading to study withdrawal. All HIL-214 formulations were found to be immunogenic in each pediatric age group as measured by HBGA blocking titers. In children between 6 weeks and 6 months of age, both the two- and three-dose regimens of the 50/150 µg formulation of HIL-214 were found to be immunogenic. In children between 6 and 12 months of age, two doses of the 50/150 µg formulation of HIL-214 were found to be more immunogenic than one dose.
 

Dose finding and formulation trials in adults
 Four dose finding and formulation trials have been conducted in adults for HIL-214. Based on the results of these trials, we selected a single dose of 15/50 µg GI.1/GII.4 VLP combination with 500 µg alum to continue to evaluate HIL-214 in adults. Further details on these trials are summarized below.
 LV03-104—A Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled age- and dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HIL-214 or saline placebo in 102 adults aged 18 to 85 years old. Forty-eight subjects aged 18 to 49 years old received either two doses of HIL-214 containing GI.1 and GII.4 VLPs (5, 15, 50, or 150 µg of each VLP) or two doses of placebo administered 4 weeks apart. Subsequently, 54 adults aged 18 to 85 years old received two doses of HIL-214 containing 50 µg of each VLP. At all tested dose levels, the vaccine was generally well tolerated and immunogenic as measured by pan-IG, class-specific IgG, and HBGA blocking titers. One dose of vaccine containing 50 µg of each VLP increased GI.1 antibody levels by 118-fold and GII.4 antibody levels by 49-fold in subjects aged 18 to 49 years old. Local reactions were mainly tenderness (71%) and injection site pain (68%) in the 66 subjects who received HIL-214, with no reported fever or vaccine-related serious AEs. A second dose at day 28 provided no apparent improvement in immunogenicity across any of the age groups. The sample size was chosen to obtain indications of safety, reactogenicity, and immune response data but was not powered for statistical significance.
 NOR-107—A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, dose, and adjuvant justification of HIL-214 in 420 healthy adults aged 18 to 64 years old. One or two doses of HIL-214 were administered 28

days apart in a factorial design testing combination of 15, 50 or 150 µg of each VLP with 0, 15 or 50 µg of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and 167 or 500 µg of alum. For subjects receiving a single dose of HIL-214, a hepatitis A vaccine (Havrix) was given as a control to maintain the blinding. The trial demonstrated that the adjuvant MPL did not significantly improve immunogenicity, and that seroresponse rates (the percentage of subjects with a greater than four-fold rise in antibody levels) were greater with 500 µg of alum than with 167 µg of alum. The most common AEs were injection site pain (46%), headache (18%), and fatigue (14%) in the 420 subjects studied, with no vaccine-related serious AEs reported. The study also showed that a second dose of the 15/50 µg GI.1/GII.4 formulation provided no apparent improvement in immunogenicity. This study was powered for statistical significance.
 NOR-201—A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HIL-214 in 454 adults aged 18 to 49 years old. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned among three groups receiving one dose of saline placebo or HIL-214 containing either 15/50 or 50/50 µg GI.1/GII.4 VLP combinations adjuvanted with 50 µg of MPL and 500 µg of alum. Both HIL-214 formulations were well tolerated and immunogenic, although GII.4 responses were higher with the 15/50 VLP combination (although the difference did not reach statistical significance). The most common AEs were pain near the injection site (69%) and muscle pain (22%) in the 299 subjects who received HIL-214, with no vaccine-related serious AEs reported. The results from this trial suggest that the 15/50 µg dose may be the optimal formulation to evaluate in adults. The sample size was chosen to provide a clinical database to support initiation of larger Phase 2 and 3 studies but was not powered for statistical significance.
 NOR-204—A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, dose formulation, and dose regimen of HIL-214 in 320 healthy adults aged 18 to over 85 years old. Older adults were stratified into three groups of 60-74 years, 75-84 years and greater than 85 years. A cohort of younger adults of 18 to 49 years was enrolled for comparison. One or two doses of HIL-214 were administered in a 15/50 µg GI.1/GII.4 VLP combination adjuvanted with 500 µg alum with or without 50 µg of MPL. For subjects receiving a single dose of HIL-214, a saline placebo was given as a control to maintain the blinding. The most common AEs were injection site pain (33%) and fatigue (12%) in the 73 subjects studied, with no vaccine-related serious AEs reported. The results of this trial suggest that there was no statistically significant benefit of either MPL or a second dose on immunogenicity, and further, suggested that the formulation of 15/50 µg GI.1/GII.4 VLP combination and 500 µg alum may be the optimal formulation to evaluate in adults. The trial also found that the antibody response in each of the older age groups was similar to that in the young adult age group. This study was powered for statistical significance.
 Efficacy trials in adults
 Proof-of-concept of the efficacy of HIL-214 in adults has been demonstrated across three clinical trials: two Phase 1/2 challenge trials and a Phase 2b field efficacy trial. Further details on these trials are summarized below.
 Challenge trial (LV01-103)—A Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an intranasal GI.1 VLP vaccine candidate after challenge with a live, vaccine-matched GI.1 norovirus strain in 98 healthy adults aged 18 and 50 years old. The vaccine formulation used in the trial contained 100 µg of GI.1 VLP and was adjuvanted with chitosan and MPL. Subjects were randomized to receive either two doses of saline placebo or GI.1 vaccine delivered intranasally three weeks apart. Subjects were then challenged with a live GI.1 virus to test the effect of vaccination on norovirus infection and disease. Vaccination significantly reduced the frequency of GI.1 infection (occurring in 61% in vaccine recipients vs. 82% in placebo recipients, p = 0.05). Vaccination also significantly reduced the frequency of GI.1 virus gastroenteritis (occurring in 37% of vaccine recipients vs. 69% of placebo recipients, p = 0.006). Furthermore, disease severity was significantly reduced as measured by modified Vesikari score, which is a validated common metric for rating the severity of gastroenteritis symptoms based on a scale of 20 (3.6 for vaccine recipients vs. 5.5 for placebo recipients, p = 0.009).



A p-value is the probability that the reported result was achieved purely by chance, such that a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 means that there is a less than or equal to 5% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to chance. A p-value of 0.05 or less typically represents a statistically significant result. The United States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) evidentiary standard when evaluating the results of a clinical trial generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05.
 Challenge trial (LV03-105)—A Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of HIL-214 after challenge with a live, GII.4 norovirus strain. The HIL-214 formulation used in the trial contained a 50/50 µg ratio of GI.1 and GII.4 VLPs and was adjuvanted with 500 µg of alum and 50 µg MPL. Subjects were between 18 and 50 years of age and received two doses of either saline placebo or GI.1/GII.4 vaccine intramuscularly four weeks apart. Subjects were then challenged with a live GII.4 virus to test the effect of vaccination on norovirus infection or disease. HIL-214 led to a significant reduction in the severity of vomiting or diarrhea by subject assessment (20% in vaccine recipients vs. 42% in placebo recipients, p = 0.028). HIL-214 also led to a significant reduction in disease severity as measured by modified Vesikari score (4.5 in vaccine recipients vs. 7.3 in placebo recipients, p = 0.002). The results of this trial showed a directional, albeit not statistically significant, reduction in frequency of AGE (26% vs. 33%) and infection (54% vs. 63%) for the HIL-214 group relative to the placebo group after challenge. We believe the lack of statistical significance was potentially due to a lower than expected infection and illness rate; only 57 of the 98 subjects were successfully infected with norovirus which lowered the statistical power for the study.
 
Field efficacy trial (NOR-211)—A Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of HIL-214 to prevent norovirus infection and moderate-to-severe AGE in the field setting. The trial was conducted in U.S. military recruits at a single base in Great Lakes, Illinois over the course of two winter seasons (2016 – 2018). In total, 4,712 subjects aged 18-49 years old were enrolled in the trial and received one dose of either saline placebo or HIL-214 (15/50 µg of GI.1/GII.4 with 500 µg of alum as an adjuvant). The primary endpoint of the NOR-211 trial was the efficacy of a single dose of HIL-214 compared to placebo to prevent cases of moderate to severe AGE due to infection by genotype matched norovirus strains represented in the vaccine (i.e., GI.1 or GII.4). The low attack rate of norovirus strains represented in the vaccine resulted in insufficient cases to assess the primary endpoint. Thirty vaccine-matched AGE cases were required to provide 80% statistical power to detect 70% vaccine efficacy; however, only 6 vaccine-matched cases occurred during the trial. Of those 6 cases, 5 were in the placebo group, corresponding to 80% vaccine efficacy for genotype matched cases of AGE (p=0.1417). On account of this lower than anticipated attack rate of GI.1 and GII.4, the statistical analysis plan was amended prior to locking the database and unblinding the trial. While only 6 vaccine-matched

AGE cases caused by GII.4 were observed, a total of 36 AGE cases caused by any norovirus genotype was observed, which was a sufficient number to evaluate the secondary endpoint of HIL-214 against moderate-to-severe AGE due to norovirus infection irrespective of genotype. Of those 36 cases, 26 were in the placebo group, corresponding to 62% vaccine efficacy (p = 0.0097) for any norovirus genotype, including those not included in HIL-214. In sum, this trial provided statistically significant evidence of heterotypic protection against at least one non-vaccine norovirus strain (GII.2). This trial also provided encouraging evidence of protection against vaccine-matched strains.
 
One potential explanation for the cross-protection observed in this trial is that HIL-214 may have induced cross-reactive antibodies against GII.2 viruses (evidence of heterotypic protection). In support of this hypothesis, HIL-214 was found to induce both binding and HBGA-blocking antibodies against GII.2 VLPs.
 Safety results in infants and children
 Safety data for HIL-214 in infants and children were collected for over 800 subjects in NOR-202, a Phase 2 safety, immunogenicity and dose finding trial. This trial demonstrated that all doses of HIL-214 were well tolerated, and there were no HIL-214-related AEs leading to trial withdrawal. AEs were largely mild to moderate in intensity and tended to subside in 3 to 4 days. In children between 6 weeks to 6 months of age who received two doses of HIL-214, the most common reactions were irritability / fussiness (19—28%), drowsiness (16—21%), pain near the injection site (9—21%), and diarrhea (10—19%) in the 180 subjects studied. In children between 6 months and 9 years of age who received two doses of HIL-214, the most common reactions were pain near the injection site (21—33%), fatigue (16—24%), headache (14—21%), and irritability / fussiness (10—20%) in the 238 subjects studied. A comparison of the reactogenicity of HIL-214 to other common pediatric vaccinations is tabulated below. These data are presented for informational purposes only, as the comparison in the table below is not based on head-to-head clinical studies and these data may not be comparable due to differences in trial designs and populations studied.



Safety in adults
 Safety data for HIL-214 in adults have been collected for over 4,000 subjects across seven clinical trials. These trials have demonstrated that HIL-214 was well tolerated, and there were no HIL-214-related AEs leading to trial withdrawal. In the NOR-211 field efficacy trial of military recruits, the most common reaction was pain near the injection site with a mean duration of 2 days (48% for HIL-214 vs. 38% for placebo) in a safety subset of 377 subjects. Systemic AEs were found to occur at a similar rate to placebo (56% for HIL-214 vs. 60% for placebo).
 
Safety data for HIL-214 in older adults (>60 years old) have also been collected for 294 subjects in NOR-204, a Phase 2 safety, immunogenicity, and dose finding trial. This study found that local AEs were mostly mild in intensity and injection-site pain was the most frequently reported symptom. In addition to these completed trials, a Phase 2 trial is currently ongoing to evaluate the long-term safety and immunogenicity of HIL-214 in 528 subjects between 18 and 85 years of age up to 5 years post vaccination (NOR-213). Interim data from this study have shown no vaccine-related serious AEs reported and maintenance of antibody levels above baseline at 3 years post vaccination. A comparison of the reactogenicity of HIL-214 to other common adult vaccinations is tabulated below. These data are presented for informational purposes only, as the comparison in the table below is not based on head-to-head clinical studies and these data may not be comparable due to differences in trial designs and populations studied.



Our clinical program in infants
 Phase 2b – infant efficacy trial (NEST-IN1)
 We plan to build on the extensive clinical data generated to date through conduct of our ongoing clinical trial in infants. We believe that initial development of HIL-214 in infants will de-risk its development given the endemic nature of disease in this population, which allows for rapid case accrual and enrollment of subjects without pre-existing immunity to norovirus.
 In May 2022, we initiated our ongoing NEST-IN1 Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of HIL-214 in approximately 3,000 infants. This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in infants of approximately 5 months of age at time of initial vaccination at sites in the United States and Latin America. We believe approximately 5 months of age is the optimum time to begin immunization as it is prior to the sharp increase in incidence of norovirus that begins at 6 months of age and coincides with the waning of maternal antibodies to norovirus. Subjects are randomized 1:1 to receive either HIL-214 or placebo. In the vaccine arm, subjects received HIL-214 (50/150 µg GI.1/GII.4 VLP combination with 500 µg alum) in a two-dose regimen delivered 28 to 56 days apart. In the control arm, subjects received saline placebo at the corresponding timepoints. The dosage and scheduling were based on learnings from the NOR-202 Phase 2 trial. The primary objective of NEST-IN1 is to evaluate the protective efficacy of HIL-214 against moderate or severe AGE events associated with GI.1 or GII.4 norovirus strains (excluding certain co-infections) during a pre-determined surveillance period that begins one month after the administration of the second dose of HIL-214. A key secondary endpoint is the evaluation of the protective efficacy of HIL-214 against any GI or GII norovirus strain. Other secondary endpoints include the evaluation of safety and immunogenicity of HIL-214.
 In May 2022, we completed enrollment of the prespecified 200 subject run-in for NEST-IN1. We resumed enrollment in NEST-IN1 in August 2022, following the prespecified safety assessment by the clinical trial's data monitoring committee. In December 2022, we reported positive interim immunogenicity results for the first 200 subjects of NEST-IN1. We expect to report top-line safety and clinical efficacy data in the first quarter of 2024.



We have developed and are qualifying a number of clinical assays to support the determination of our primary and secondary endpoints. These include an assay to detect norovirus in stool samples and determine norovirus genogroup (e.g., GI or GII), a sequencing assay to determine norovirus genotype (e.g., GI.1 or GII.4), and a co-pathogen assay to detect other pathogens that may cause AGE (e.g., rotavirus or Salmonella). The immunogenicity of HIL-214 will be evaluated using assays that measure HBGA-blocking antibody titers and pan-Ig antibody titers. We have designed the assays for NEST-IN1 based on learnings from the NOR-211 Phase 2b study and the NOR-202 Phase 2 study in adults, as well as preliminary feedback Takeda received from the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA). We reported interim safety data for the first 200 subjects in the third quarter of 2022 following a positive recommendation from the data monitoring committee to continue enrollment. We reported positive interim immunogenicity data for the first approximately 200 subjects in the fourth quarter of 2022 where we observed immune responses generally consistent with prior studies of HIL-214 in infants. Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of pan-IG antibodies 28 days following the second dose were 11,102.0 IU/mL and 2,185.5 IU/mL for GI.1 and GII.4, respectively, for HIL-214 compared to 59.6 IU/mL and 73.5 IU/mL for GI.1 and GII.4, respectively, for placebo. These titers corresponded to a Geometric Mean Fold Rise (GMFR) versus baseline of more than 18-fold for HIL-214. Seroresponse rates (SRRs) for HIL-214, defined in NEST-IN1 as the percentage of subjects with at least a 4-fold increase in pan-Ig (immunoglobulin) antibody titers 28 days following the second dose compared to pre-vaccination baseline, were 99.0% for GI.1 and 86.9% for GII.4. SRRs for placebo were 4.1% and 3.1% for GI.1 and GII.4, respectively.
Phase 3 infant efficacy trial
 Based on the results from NEST-IN1, if positive, we intend to consult with key regulatory authorities and initiate a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of HIL-214 in a larger clinical trial. We expect that this trial will enroll approximately 5,000 to 6,000 subjects that will be randomized 1:1 into the vaccine or control arm. Trial sites under consideration are located in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and Japan.



Other trials in infants
 We are planning additional trials in infants to support regulatory submissions. These include a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to establish whether the safety and immunogenicity data obtained is consistent with that previously obtained for non-Japanese pediatric subjects, and to support the potential inclusion of Japanese infants in a Phase 3 trial of HIL-214. These include a Phase 2 trial to evaluate the immune response to routine pediatric vaccinations when co-administered with HIL-214, which is designed to inform our global strategy for our pivotal Phase 3 infant efficacy trial with HIL214.
 We also expect to conduct a Phase 3 trial to evaluate lot-to-lot consistency of HIL-214.
We believe that successful completion of this clinical program in infants, together with existing clinical data, will support regulatory submissions for marketing approval in most territories of the world, including the United States, Europe, Japan, and Latin America.
 Our immunobridging strategy to other age groups
 Overview
 If we are successful in obtaining approval for HIL-214 in infants, we plan to subsequently seek approval of HIL-214 in additional age groups, including older children and adolescents (2 to 17 years of age), adults (18 to 59 years of age), and older adults (60 years of age and older). Our preferred strategic approach for seeking approval in these populations is through conducting immunobridging trials, which aim to demonstrate non-inferiority of immune response between a reference age group (i.e., infants) and target age groups. These trials require an appropriate serological surrogate for efficacy and can potentially support regulatory submissions seeking approval to expand to these other age groups without the need for an efficacy trial. Key requirements for an immunobridging strategy include:
 •Comparability. The same or comparable immune assay should be used in the reference and target populations.
 •Predictability. The immune assay should be reasonably likely to predict protection from infection or disease. Regulatory authorities are more likely to accept functional immune assays (e.g., blocking or neutralization assays) than non-functional immune assays (e.g., assays that measure bulk antibody levels).
 •Well-defined non-inferiority margins. Non-inferiority margins should be prospectively defined and justified to regulatory authorities.
 We believe the most likely serological surrogate will be blocking antibodies to HBGAs, which have previously been shown to correlate with protection against norovirus. We are planning to collect HBGA-blocking titers for all subjects in our planned Phase 2b and Phase 3 infant efficacy trials to use as a reference for immunobridging to other age groups. In addition to HBGA-blocking antibodies, we are also exploring the measurement of other immune parameters that may be reasonably likely to predict protection.
 If we are not able to confirm an appropriate serological surrogate in our planned infant efficacy trials, or if the FDA or EMA do not agree with our proposed immunobridging strategy, we plan to directly evaluate HIL-214 for efficacy in older adults

(65 years of age and older). We would plan to conduct this trial across multiple sites at high-risk for norovirus outbreaks, including nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other older adult communities.
 Historical precedent for immunobridging
 A number of vaccines have successfully used immunobridging to expand the approval of a vaccine to those in other age groups, without conducting further efficacy studies, including Boostrix, Gardasil, Cervarix, and Vaxchora. For example, Boostrix used a prior infant efficacy study to bridge to older subjects and included the use of a different vaccine strength and regimen in infants and older age groups. This immunobridging strategy was based on demonstrating non-inferiority of pertussis antigen seroresponses in adolescents (10 to 18 years of age), adults (19 to 64 years of age), and older adults (65 years of age and older) to prior infant responses in efficacy trials. Of particular note, this strategy was successful for Boostrix even in the absence of an established correlate of protection for pertussis.
 HIL-214 commercial opportunity
 The global vaccine market is estimated to have been over $50 billion in 2020 and is expected to exceed $100 billion by 2027. Pneumococcal vaccines have historically been the largest vaccine category, with $7 billion in sales in 2020. COVID-19 vaccines are the largest category in 2021. We believe that the increased attention given to infectious diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the important role of vaccines in disease prevention, is likely to further increase the size of the global vaccine market.
 There are currently no approved vaccines for the prevention of norovirus-related illness. However, there are market analogues that we believe we can use to estimate the size of the commercial opportunity for HIL-214. In the pediatric market, we believe that rotavirus vaccines are the closest analogue to HIL-214. Rotavirus was the leading cause of pediatric viral AGE before the introduction of the rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix and RotaTeq. These vaccines, approved only in infants, are now widely adopted worldwide, with many countries achieving vaccination rates above 80% among one-year-olds. Rotavirus vaccines generated more than $1.5 billion in sales in 2021. For comparison, norovirus today has a similar morbidity, mortality, and economic burden in children as rotavirus did before the introduction of rotavirus vaccines. When considering all age groups, the overall burden of norovirus is greater than that of rotavirus.
 In the older adult market, we believe that Shingrix, a recombinant protein vaccine developed by GSK to prevent shingles, is an analogue for HIL-214 due to the similarities in morbidity, mortality and economic burden between shingles and norovirus each before the introduction of a vaccine. Shingrix generated $2.3 billion in sales in 2021. For comparison, norovirus today has a greater morbidity, mortality, and economic burden than shingles did before the introduction of shingles vaccines. Prior to shingles vaccines becoming available, shingles was estimated to result in 1 million illnesses, 46,000 hospitalizations, and 80 deaths each year among adults over 50 years of age in the United States, for a total societal cost of $2.4 billion. In contrast, norovirus results in 22 million illnesses, 96,000 hospitalizations, and 1,350 deaths each year among all age groups in the United States, for a total societal cost of $10 billion. Furthermore, we believe that there is a commercial opportunity for a norovirus vaccine in other groups at high risk for norovirus infection, such as healthcare workers, immunocompromised individuals, military personnel, food handlers, and travelers, including cruise ship passengers.
 A key element of our commercial strategy is to receive advisory body recommendations for the use of HIL-214. In particular, we are focused on the ACIP, which is an advisory body of the CDC that develops vaccine recommendations for children and adults in the United States. New pediatric vaccines that received a preferred recommendation from ACIP are nearly universally adopted by pediatricians and are often required by schools. Rotavirus vaccines received an ACIP recommendation in 2006, which has contributed to their broad uptake in the United States. Following completion of our planned Phase 2b and 3 trials in infants, we expect ACIP to review these data with the goal of having ACIP recommend HIL-214 for routine pediatric use. We also plan to pursue an ACIP recommendation in the older adult population.
 Competition
 Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and strong emphasis on proprietary products. According to EvaluatePharma, October, 2021, the current vaccine market is concentrated among a few global biopharmaceutical companies including BioNTech, CSL Bering, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Moderna, Pfizer, Sanofi, and Takeda, which together account for the majority of global vaccine sales. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions are also active in the vaccine market given the continuing global need for both existing and new vaccines.
 While we believe that our team, technology, strategy, and depth of clinical data relative to other products in clinical development provide us with a strong competitive advantage, if HIL-214 receives marketing approval, we will have to compete with new products and therapies that may become available in the future. The key competitive factors that will affect the success of HIL-214 are similar to those faced by other vaccine products: safety, immunogenicity, protective

efficacy, duration of effect, convenience of administration, price, public health policy, and reimbursement by third-party payors.
 There are currently no approved vaccines for the prevention of norovirus-related illness. While we are not aware of all of our competitors’ efforts, based on public statements, we believe that several companies are in various stages of developing a vaccine for norovirus including China National Biotec, Chongqing Zhifei Biological, Icon Genetics and Vaxart. We believe that China National Biotec, Chongqing Zhifei Biological and Icon Genetics are also focused on developing a vaccine consisting of VLPs representing the GI and GII genogroups of norovirus. Further, we believe that China National Biotec and Chongqing Zhifei Biological are also developing a pediatric vaccine for the prevention of norovirus-related illness. We believe that HIL-214 is well positioned to be the first norovirus vaccine approved in any market worldwide.
 Manufacturing
 We do not have, nor do we plan to establish, large-scale manufacturing facilities that are compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). For our Phase 2b infant efficacy trial, we are using clinical material that was previously manufactured by Takeda. We have relied on, and plan to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce cGMP material, including bulk intermediate VLPs, drug substance and drug product, for our future clinical trials and commercial supply, if approved.
 Intellectual property
 Intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, and trademarks, is important to our business. Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary intellectual property protection for HIL-214, as well as for future vaccine candidates and novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know-how. Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing, misappropriating or violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating or violating our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our policy is to develop and maintain protection of our proprietary position by, among other methods, licensing or filing U.S. and foreign patents and applications relating to our technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
 Our patent portfolio, comprising patents and patent applications exclusively licensed to us, is built with a goal of establishing broad protection that generally includes, for the vaccine candidate compound, claims directed to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions or formulations, methods of synthesis, and methods of use of such pharmaceutical compositions or formulations. As of March 1, 2023, our patent portfolio covering HIL-214 consists solely of patents and patent applications exclusively licensed from Takeda. Subject to the terms of the Takeda License we entered into with Takeda on July 2, 2021, we have licensed from Takeda exclusive commercialization rights worldwide, excluding Japan, to patents and patent applications covering the composition of matter, formulation, use and/or manufacture of HIL-214. Our patent portfolio comprises 11 distinct patent families protecting the technology relating to HIL-214 composition of matter, methods of manufacturing HIL-214, formulations of HIL-214 products, as well as methods of use of HIL-214. As of March 1, 2023, our portfolio consists of approximately 23 issued U.S. patents, 4 pending U.S. patent applications, 1 allowed U.S. patent application, 2 pending international PCT applications, 68 issued foreign patents including 6 issued European patents subsequently validated in individual European countries, and 55 foreign patent applications pending in major international markets. The issued patents and pending applications have nominal expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2042, without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
 More specifically, of the 11 distinct patent families, we have in-licensed two patent families relating to manufacturing methods for norovirus VLPs. One of these families contains four U.S. patents projected to expire from 2028 to 2029, as well as a granted patent in each of Canada, Hong Kong, Europe, Republic of Korea and Singapore and two granted patents in Australia, also projected to expire in 2028, in each case without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions. The European patent in this family was validated in Belgium, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Poland and Sweden. There is an additional pending application in Singapore, projected to expire in 2028, without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The other patent family covering manufacturing methods contains two U.S. patents projected to expire from 2033 to 2035, as well as a granted patent in each of Australia, Europe, Hong Kong, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Republic of Korea, Mexico and Taiwan, all projected to expire in 2033, in each case without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions.

There is an additional pending application in Europe, projected to expire in 2039, without accounting for any available patent term adjustments or extensions.
 The term of individual patents in our portfolio depends upon the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent may be eligible for patent term adjustment, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for delays incurred at the USPTO during the patent prosecution process. In addition, for patents that cover an FDA-approved drug, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. While the length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review, patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent per approved drug may be extended, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the

future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek any available patent term extension to any issued patents we may be granted in any jurisdiction where such extensions are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or vaccine candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe, misappropriate or violate our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us or Takeda in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products or the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, issued patents do not guarantee the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Issued patents only allow us to block potential competitors from practicing the claimed inventions of the issued patents.
 Further, patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing HIL-214 and any future vaccine candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and any issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for HIL-214 and any future vaccine candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to HIL-214 and any future vaccine candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular vaccine candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
 It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us, and for employees and consultants to enter into invention assignment agreements with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Where applicable, the agreements provide that all inventions to which the individual contributed as an inventor shall be assigned to Hillevax, and as such, will become our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information. For information regarding the risks related to intellectual property, see “Risk factors—Risks related to our intellectual property.”
 Further, we have filed for three trademark applications in the United States for the HilleVax trademark and logo.
 License agreement with Takeda
 On July 2, 2021, we and Takeda entered into the Takeda License. Pursuant to the Takeda License, Takeda granted us: (a) an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable (with Takeda’s reasonable consent) license under (1) certain patents and know-how relating to HIL-214 (formerly TAK-214), and owned or controlled by Takeda during the term of the Takeda License and (2) Takeda’s rights in intellectual property jointly created by the parties under the Takeda License (the Joint Intellectual Property), in each case, to commercialize for all human uses worldwide outside of Japan (the Territory) any pharmaceutical products (the Products) containing the HIL-214 compounds and any derivatives thereof to prevent or minimize disease and/or infections caused by norovirus (the Compounds), and (b) a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable (with Takeda’s reasonable consent) license under such patents and know-how to develop and manufacture the Compounds and Products solely to: (1) exploit the Compounds and Products in the Territory, (2) perform certain development activities in Japan, and (3) supply the Product to Takeda pursuant to any clinical supply or commercial supply agreement. We granted Takeda: (a) a non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, sublicensable license under our rights in any patents and know-how and our rights in the Joint Intellectual Property that are necessary or useful to enable Takeda to develop and manufacture the Compounds and Products anywhere in the world for the purposes of commercialization of the Products in Japan, (b) an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under such patents

and know-how to (1) commercialize Products in Japan and (2) commercialize Products for purposes other than for use in humans, and (c) an exclusive, sublicensable license to use Product trademarks solely for commercialization of a Product for human uses in Japan. Certain rights granted to us under the Takeda License are subject to rights granted by Takeda to the United States government pursuant to sponsored research, clinical development and material transfer agreements.
 If, other than due to force majeure or our failure to perform our obligations under the Takeda License, Takeda fails to pursue regulatory or commercialization activities by specified deadlines, and does not dispute such failure or initiate such activities by a specified deadline, then the Territory may be expanded to include Japan (i.e., worldwide). During the term of the Takeda License, neither party is permitted to commercialize any vaccine product (other than the Product) that includes norovirus virus-like particles and is being developed for or is approved for the prevention or minimization of symptoms caused by norovirus infections without the other party’s prior written consent. We will be responsible, at our cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the Product in the Territory. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the Product in the Territory, and to seek regulatory approval for the Product throughout the world.
 We paid Takeda upfront consideration consisting of 840,500 shares of common stock and a warrant to purchase 5,883,500 shares of common stock (the Takeda Warrant). We further agreed that, in the event that Takeda’s fully-diluted ownership, including the Takeda Warrant, represents less a certain specified percentage of our fully-diluted capitalization, including shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible promissory notes, calculated immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering (IPO), we would issue an additional warrant to purchase shares of common stock such that Takeda would hold a certain specified percentage of the fully-diluted capitalization immediately before the closing of the IPO (the Takeda Warrant Right). The Takeda Warrant was fully exercised in November 2022. The Takeda Warrant Right expired without effect since no fair value had been allocated to it upon completion of our IPO, and no additional warrant was issued. We also paid Takeda a cash payment of $2.5 million upon the consummation of our convertible promissory note financing in August 2021 and paid Takeda $2.5 million in March 2022 upon release of certain drug products and completion of certain regulatory activities. We are required to make to Takeda a one-time payment of $7.5 million upon achievement of a specified development milestone and one-time commercial milestone payments of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate if certain annual sales targets for Products are met in the Territory. We agreed to pay Takeda tiered high-single digit to low-teen percentage royalties on net sales of Products in the Territory, subject to specified offsets and reductions, and Takeda agreed to pay us tiered mid-single digit to low-double digit percentage royalties on net sales of Products in Japan, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis beginning on the first commercial sale of such Product in such country, until the later of (i) the expiration of the licensed patents covering the applicable Product, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or (iii) 20 years following the first commercial sale of such Product in such country.
 Absent early termination, the Takeda License expires on a country-by-country and Product-by-Product basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to each Product in each country, as applicable, or in its entirety upon the expiration of the royalty term with respect to the last Product commercialized in the last country. We may terminate the Takeda License in its entirety without cause upon six months’ prior written notice. We and Takeda may terminate the Takeda License in the case of the other party’s insolvency, or upon prior written notice within a specified time period for the other party’s material uncured breach. Takeda may terminate the Takeda License in its entirety if we challenge the licensed patents, or if we assist any third party in challenging such patents. Upon termination of the Takeda License, Takeda will have an exclusive, transferable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, sublicensable license under the patents and know-how we license to Takeda under the Takeda License and our rights in the Joint Intellectual Property to exploit the Product in the terminated countries.
 Transitional services agreement with Takeda
 As contemplated by the Takeda License, on December 17, 2021, we and Takeda entered into a Transitional Services Agreement (the TSA). Pursuant to the TSA, Takeda has agreed to provide, on a transitional basis following the effective date of the Takeda License, certain services related to research and development and regulatory assistance services, oversight and management of ongoing clinical and research studies, and maintenance of certain third party vendor contracts. In consideration for the services provided under the TSA, we have agreed to pay certain specified amounts to Takeda in cash for such services and certain pass-through costs.
 Unless earlier terminated under its terms, the TSA will remain in effect until all transitional services are completed. We may terminate the provision of any or all services under the TSA upon certain written notice. We and Takeda may terminate the TSA in the case of the other party’s insolvency, or upon prior written notice within a specified time period for

the other party’s material uncured breach. Takeda may terminate the TSA for non-payment and, in certain circumstances, upon a change of control of our company.
 Government regulation and product approval
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 U.S. biologics regulation
 In the United States, biological products, or biologics, such as vaccines are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice requirements (GLPs);
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials and other necessary studies;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements (GCPs); and
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the product candidate’s toxicity in animals, in an effort to support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations.
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, the trial sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational biologic to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product candidate, chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the product candidate. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the

parameters to be used in monitoring subject safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study, and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or on other grounds, such as failure to demonstrate efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries, including clinicaltrials.gov.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 •Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or sponsors may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA.
 While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 In addition, during the development of a new biologic, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before a BLA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach alignment on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the product candidate.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA submission and review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product candidate for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other

things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product candidate, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product candidate is safe, pure and potent for the proposed indication, and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may include limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once a BLA is approved, the FDA may withdraw such approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety, purity and potency after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited development and review programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA

and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a biologic product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Post-approval requirements
 Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements up. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;


•clinical holds on clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims that are in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict a manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and reference product exclusivity
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Other U.S. regulatory requirements
 In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical companies are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages,

fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
 Coverage and reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of HIL-214 or any potential future vaccine candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for HIL-214 or any potential future vaccine candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors.
 Certain ACA marketplace and other private payor plans are required to include coverage for certain preventative services, including vaccinations recommended by the ACIP without cost share obligations (i.e., co-payments, deductibles or co-insurance) for plan members. Children through 18 years of age without other health insurance coverage may be eligible to receive such vaccinations free-of-charge through the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program. For Medicare beneficiaries, vaccines may be covered under either the Part B or Part D program depending on several criteria, including the type of vaccine and the beneficiary’s coverage eligibility. If our vaccine candidates, once approved, are covered only under the Part D program, physicians may be less willing to use our products because of the claims adjudication costs and time related to the claims adjudication process and collection of co-payments associated with the Part D program.
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of a product, the extent of coverage and the amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Third-party payors may not consider HIL-214 or our potential future vaccine candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval.
 In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing product pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Union (EU) pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products are regulated at a national level under the individual EU member states’ social security systems. Some foreign countries provide options to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and can control the prices and reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A country may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Even if approved for reimbursement, historically, product candidates launched in some foreign countries, such as some countries in the EU, do not follow price structures of the United States and prices generally tend to be significantly lower.
 Healthcare reform
 In the United States, there have been, and continues to be, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates, and similar healthcare laws and regulations exist in the EU and other jurisdictions. Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or

expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how the other healthcare reform measures will impact our business.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price (AMP), beginning January 1, 2024. More recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 Data privacy and security laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the

operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
 Foreign regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product candidates in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Preclinical studies and clinical trials
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Preclinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for preclinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), guidelines on good clinical practices (GCP) as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Certain countries outside of the United States, including the EU, have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. A CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved by the national health authority and the ethics committee has granted a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the trial in the relevant member state(s), in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
 The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU member state in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to become applicable by early 2022, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP). Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Marketing authorizations
 In the EU, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization (MA). To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the

EU, with the exception of, among other things, country specific document requirements. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
 The centralized procedure results in a single MA, issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) which is valid across the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines and (iv) ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases.
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the national competent authority of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference member state.
 Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of a MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process. Innovative medicines fulfilling a medical need may also benefit from different types of fast track approvals, such as a conditional MA or a MA under exceptional circumstances granted on the basis of less comprehensive clinical data than normally required (respectively in the likelihood that the sponsor will provide such data within an agreed timeframe or when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after authorization).
 Classical MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
 Data and marketing exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two year period of market exclusivity, a generic/biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic/biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the

EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
 Foreign post-approval requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs).
 All new MAA must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
