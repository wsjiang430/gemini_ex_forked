 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company advancing clinical candidates with the potential to improve the lives of millions of people living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection around the world, an early-stage development program targeting high-recurrence genital herpes associated with herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection and research programs focused on the discovery of novel antivirals to treat devastating viral diseases, including hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and transplant-related herpesviruses.
 In July 2022, we implemented a strategic restructuring plan to: (1) discontinue development of our first-generation core inhibitor (CI), vebicorvir (VBR), based on review of interim on-treatment efficacy data from then ongoing triple combination studies that did not support continuation; (2) advance our next-generation CIs, ABI-H3733 (3733) and ABI-4334 (4334), in clinical studies; and (3) prioritize research activities, including our: HBV/HDV entry inhibitor; orally bioavailable, liver-focused interferon-α (IFN-α) receptor (IFNAR) agonist; long-acting HSV-2 helicase inhibitor targeting high-recurrence genital herpes; and programs targeting pan-herpes non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors (NNPIs) for transplant-associated infections. The strategic plan included a reduction of our workforce by 30 employees, resulting in a total of approximately 70 remaining employees. In connection with the plan, our Chief Medical Officer and Chief Financial Officer stepped down from their roles.
 Our Strategic Approaches
 Our current business strategy is focused on three parallel paths:
 •Highly Potent Next-Generation HBV Core Inhibitors – Advancing our novel next-generation CIs in clinical studies, with 4334 (currently prioritized) and 3733 (currently paused) in ongoing Phase 1a and Phase 1b studies, respectively.
 •Novel Small Molecule Approaches for HBV and HDV – Advancing research programs targeting (1) an orally bioavailable HBV/HDV entry inhibitor and (2) an orally bioavailable, liver-focused IFNAR agonist.
 •Novel Antivirals Targeting Herpesviruses – Advancing (1) ABI-5366 (5366), a long-acting HSV-2 helicase inhibitor targeting high-recurrence genital herpes to clinical trials, and (2) a research program for pan-herpes NNPIs to treat transplant-associated infections. 
 HBV Strategy
 Inspired by the hundreds of millions of people worldwide living with chronic HBV infection, the goal of our HBV program is to discover and develop finite and curative therapies for these patients. While we have learned that combination therapy with our first-generation CI product candidate, VBR, plus the standard of care, nucleos(t)ide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NrtI), did not result in a finite and curative treatment, we have designed and developed our next-generation CIs for significantly increased potency and ability to engage an additional mechanism of action, targeting the viral reservoir, that VBR could not. We believe that a regimen of our next-generation CIs in combination with NrtI therapy will be the antiviral backbone of future finite and curative therapies. To reach a finite and curative therapy, it may also be necessary to include additional mechanisms of action, whether discovered and developed internally or externally through collaborations, licenses, partnerships and other types of business arrangements.

Development Pipeline Strategy
 To complement our CI programs seeking finite and curative chronic HBV therapies, we have leveraged the depth and breadth of our virology expertise to expand our pipeline with a focus on novel mechanisms acting on clinically validated targets in therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need. Since beginning this portfolio expansion in late 2021, we have announced several new programs, both in- and outside of HBV: our HDV/HBV entry inhibitor program, our IFNAR agonist program, our pan-herpes NNPI programs for transplant-associated infections and the long-acting HSV-2 helicase inhibitor for high-recurrence genital herpes. We recently nominated 5366 as a development candidate for our HSV-2 program and look forward to future candidate nominations from our discovery virology pipeline.
 We believe that these new programs are compelling complements to our CIs, as each program focuses on a clinically validated target in a virologic disease where innovation is critical to improving patients’ lives. In addition, because certain of our new programs are focused on treatments for chronic diseases, rather than curative therapies, the path to proof-of-concept and registrational studies may be significantly shorter than that for our finite and curative HBV therapeutics.
Our HBV and HDV Programs
 The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 296 million people worldwide are chronically infected with HBV as of 2019, and 1.5 million new infections occur each year. HBV is a leading global cause of chronic liver disease and liver transplants, and the WHO estimates that 820,000 people died in 2019 from HBV, mostly due to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Of the 296 million people living with chronic HBV infection as of 2019, only approximately 30 million were aware of their infection, and only approximately 6.6 million of those diagnosed received treatment. HBV is a highly prevalent disease that infects more than three times the number of people infected with hepatitis C virus and HIV infections combined, according to the WHO, and has a higher morbidity and mortality rate.
 The current standard of care for chronic HBV infection, NrtIs, are taken life-long and reduce, but do not eliminate, the virus and result in very low cure rates, leaving an enormous unmet need. No new mechanisms of action (MOA) have been approved for chronic HBV infection in over 25 years. The focus of our HBV program is to improve outcomes and increase the number of patients diagnosed and treated through the development of finite and curative therapies.
We are also progressing two programs with potential application against HDV. HDV is a “satellite virus,” because it can only infect people (1) who are already infected with HBV or (2) at the same time as a person is infected with HBV. HDV impacts a subset of approximately 12 million HBV patients. These patients, which only comprise an estimated 4.5% of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive patients, experience a substantially increased disease burden, as they account for 18% of cirrhosis and 20% of hepatocellular carcinoma associated with HBV. In parallel with our efforts to develop finite therapies and functional cures for HBV, we are also advancing programs targeting HDV given the immediate disease burden facing these patients.
 The current standard of care treatment for HDV is off-label pegylated IFN-α injected weekly or, in some regions, a large, complex molecule that requires daily injections. We believe a safe and effective oral small molecule entry inhibitor would be a significant innovation for patients living with HDV.
 Core Inhibitors
 HBV is a DNA virus that infects hepatocytes and establishes a reservoir of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), a unique viral DNA moiety that resides in the cell nucleus of HBV-infected hepatocytes and is associated with viral persistence and chronic infection. No currently approved oral therapies target cccDNA activity directly, which makes molecules that can modulate cccDNA generation or disrupt its function highly sought in the HBV field. As a result, we have worked to discover and develop compounds targeting the core protein, a viral protein involved in numerous aspects of the HBV replication cycle, including the generation of HBV cccDNA. Through our research efforts, we have discovered several chemically distinct series of small molecule CIs that directly target and allosterically inhibit core protein functions. As a result, we believe that our pipeline offers the potential for both first-in-class and best-in-class compounds that target critical steps involved in cccDNA generation and the HBV viral replication cycle.

A benchmark for therapeutic agents aiming to decrease cccDNA levels is the use of several key viral antigens as surrogate biomarkers of active cccDNA. The same biomarkers can be used in both primary human hepatocyte cells and patients. On this basis, our CIs have shown preclinical proof of principle. In a variety of cell culture models, CIs have demonstrated the ability to reduce production of viral HBV DNA levels as well as the surrogate markers for cccDNA establishment: HBV e antigen (HBeAg), HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg) and viral pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA).
 Our research and development organizations are advancing next-generation CIs through clinical development. These candidates, which exhibit multiple MOAs, have been optimized to potently disrupt both viral replication (MOA #1) and, importantly, prevent the establishment and replenishment of new cccDNA (MOA #2). cccDNA is the viral reservoir that drives HBV’s life-long persistence in patients. First-generation CIs have not demonstrated adequate potency to sufficiently block its formation. Further, the current standard of care, NrtIs, can only inhibit production of new virus—and do so incompletely.
We leveraged our prior experience with our first-generation CI, VBR, which did not have sufficient potency against MOA #2, in the development of our next-generation CIs. VBR was evaluated in a Phase 2 program with treatment for up to 1.5 years across patient populations and exhibited a favorable safety profile. VBR was observed to be potent against MOA #1 but not MOA #2, and, while it demonstrated greater viral suppression in combination with standard-of-care NrtIs than NrtIs alone, it did not achieve functional cure or finite treatment in our clinical studies. As a result, we discontinued development of VBR. Our two next-generation CIs, 3733 and 4334, were developed to optimize activity against both MOAs and show significantly enhanced potency against both mechanisms preclinically.
 3733
 3733 was internally discovered and developed. The chemical scaffold of 3733 is novel and distinct from 4334 and both of our discontinued first-generation CI product candidates, VBR and ABI-H2158 (2158).
 In preclinical studies, 3733 has demonstrated pan-genotypic activity and an improved resistance profile, as well as significantly increased potency against both MOAs and target coverage as compared to both VBR and 2158. In 2020, we initiated and completed a Phase 1a clinical study of 3733 to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) following single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose administration in healthy subjects in New Zealand. Data indicated that 3733 was generally well-tolerated and had favorable PK. Results detailing 3733’s safety and PK from this study were presented in a poster presentation at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) The Liver Meeting® in November 2021 (AASLD 2021). In 2021, following the completion of the Phase 1a trial, our chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) organization developed a new tablet formulation to support Phase 1b for 3733. At the European Association for the Study of the Liver's (EASL) International Liver CongressTM in June 2022 (EASL 2022), we presented 3733’s improved PK profile resulting from the new formulation activities mentioned above.
 In addition, at EASL's International Liver CongressTM in June 2021 (EASL 2021), we presented observations on 3733’s enhanced potency and target coverage for both antiviral activity and inhibition of cccDNA generation as compared to VBR and 2158.
In June 2022, we initiated a randomized, multi-center, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase 1b trial of 3733 evaluating the safety, PK and antiviral activity of 3733 in adults with cHBV infection, including changes in HBV DNA and other viral parameters associated with 3733 treatment in adults with chronic HBV infection who are treatment naïve or off treatment. Patients were randomized 8:2 between the new tablet formulation of 3733 and placebo for a period of 28 days.
In December 2022, we released interim data from the Phase 1b trial, which consisted primarily of HBeAg negative patients. The dose selected for the first cohort was 50 mg. Given the potent antiviral activity observed at 50 mg, a 25 mg dose was selected for the second cohort to further explore the dose response curve of 3733. A dose of 100 mg was selected for the third cohort.
 As of mid-December 2022, dosing in the 3733 Phase 1b trial had been completed for all ten patients in the 50 mg first cohort. Nine of ten patients enrolled were HBeAg negative, so efficacy data was provided for these patients. Interim

efficacy results from this cohort as of mid-December included HBV DNA, HBV RNA and antigen measurements for all patients for the full 28-day dosing period.
 In the 50 mg cohort, six of eight patients receiving 3733 achieved HBV DNA less than the lower limit of quantification (<LLOQ) within 21 days, with a mean decline in HBV DNA over the treatment period of approximately 3.1 logs. Data on HBV RNA declines were limited due to low baseline levels in predominantly e-antigen negative patients.
 The second cohort, evaluating a dose of 25 mg, was fully enrolled by December 2022. Nine of ten patients enrolled were HBeAg negative. In the five patients that had completed 28 days of treatment as of mid-December 2022, the mean reduction in HBV DNA was approximately 1.9 logs. Data on HBV RNA levels were not available as of mid-December 2022.
 The third cohort, evaluating a dose of 100 mg, was fully enrolled by February 2023. Ten of 11 patients enrolled were HBeAg negative so efficacy data were not provided for the single HBeAg positive patient. Interim efficacy results from this cohort as of mid-March included HBV DNA, HBV RNA and antigen measurements for the seven HBeAg negative patients receiving 3733 that had completed 28 days of treatment. All seven patients achieved HBV DNA <LLOQ within 21 days. As all of these patients reached <LLOQ, the mean declines in HBV DNA over the treatment period of approximately 3.0 logs reflect baseline DNA levels and the lower limit of the quantifiable range in this cohort. Data on HBV RNA declines were limited due to low baseline levels in HBeAg negative patients. As expected given the 28-day dosing period, limited changes in viral antigens were observed.
 In the 25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg cohorts through mid-March 2023, all treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities reported were Grade 1 or Grade 2. Further, no AEs led to treatment discontinuation, and no clinically significant ECG abnormalities or patterns of AEs or lab abnormalities were noted.
The observed PK for the new tablet formulation of 3733 was consistent with predictions from preclinical studies, providing exposure equivalent to the liquid formulation evaluated in the Phase 1a study for 3733. Available PK data through mid-March 2023 indicated that exposures exhibited dose-proportional increases in the dose range from 25 mg to 100 mg.
As expected, given the 28-day dosing period, limited changes in viral antigens were observed.
 A 26-week non-clinical chronic toxicology study of 3733 has been ongoing in parallel with the Phase 1b study. This study revealed a time-dependent toxicity in one species that was not observed in the previous 28-day toxicology study. We continue to evaluate the data; however, proceeding with longer-term dosing of 3733 in a Phase 2 study would require further assessment and likely an additional chronic toxicology study in another species, which would add cost and time to the development timeline for 3733.
In March 2023, based on data to date from the ongoing clinical Phase 1 studies of both 3733 and 4334 and a nonclinical chronic toxicology study of 3733, we have paused core inhibitor candidate 3733 and prioritized core inhibitor candidate 4334.
 4334
 In mid-2021, we announced the selection of 4334, the second of our next-generation CI product candidates. As with all our CI product candidates nominated after VBR, 4334 was internally discovered and developed. In addition, the chemical scaffold of 4334 is also novel and distinct from VBR, which is licensed from Indiana University, 3733 and 2158.
 We nominated 4334 based on a preclinical target drug profile that indicates enhanced target coverage and potency against both MOAs. We believe that 4334 has a best-in-class preclinical profile, with single-digit nanomolar potency against the production of new virus and the formation of cccDNA. Preclinically to date, 4334 has also demonstrated pan-genotypic activity, an improved resistance profile and a favorable safety profile. Preclinical characterization of 4334 was shared in a poster presentation at AASLD in November 2021. At EASL 2022, we presented preclinical data demonstrating that 4334 promotes formation of empty capsids and prevents cccDNA formation by disrupting incoming capsids. At AASLD in November 2022 (AASLD 2022), we presented preclinical data demonstrating that 4334 also accelerates capsid assembly and inhibits cccDNA formation through multiple pathways and showed that

4334 can prematurely disrupt capsids containing dendrimer-like-DNA, which has the potential to impact HBV integration.
 In October 2022, we initiated a Phase 1a clinical study of 4334 to evaluate safety, tolerability and PK following single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose administration in healthy subjects in New Zealand.
 We shared interim data from this Phase 1a trial at two time points, as of mid-December 2022 for the initial 30 mg single dose cohort and as of mid-March 2023 for all remaining single dose cohorts (100 mg, 200 mg and 400 mg) and the first 100 mg multiple-dose cohort. Dosing has completed for the second and final multiple dose cohort of 200 mg and a food effect cohort at 200 mg is also ongoing. We expect to share safety and PK data from this final multiple dose cohort when available in April 2023.
Based on data available for the single-dose and 100 mg multiple-dose cohorts as of mid-March 2023, 4334 had a mean half-life supporting once-a-day dosing. Based on the PK data from these cohorts and preclinical studies, daily minimum plasma trough concentrations (Cmin) were projected to achieve double-digit multiples of the protein-adjusted EC50 for both MOAs within the dose ranges studied in the Phase 1a study.
 Through mid-March 2023, treatment-emergent AEs and laboratory abnormalities were mild to moderate and there were no patterns of AEs or laboratory abnormalities noted and no clinically significant ECG abnormalities were reported.
 In March 2023, based on data to date from the ongoing clinical Phase 1 studies of both 3733 and 4334 and a nonclinical chronic toxicology study of 3733, we have prioritized core inhibitor candidate 4334 and paused core inhibitor candidate 3733.
 VBR
 At the time of our decision to discontinue development of VBR, we had three triple combination studies involving VBR ongoing, two of which were terminated early in 2022. The third triple combination study, Study 204, was subsequently terminated in February 2023. Study 204 was being conducted pursuant to a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement with Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Arbutus Biopharma) and consisted of a randomized, multi-center, open-label Phase 2 clinical study to explore the safety, PK and antiviral activity of the triple combination of VBR, NrtI and AB-729 (Arbutus Biopharma’s investigational RNAi candidate) compared to the double combinations of VBR + NrtI and AB-729 + NrtI in virologically suppressed patients. This clinical study was initiated in the first quarter of 2021 and completed enrollment in February 2022. At the time of discontinuation of further VBR clinical development, in consultation with Arbutus Biopharma, we agreed to continue Study 204 and evaluate the primary endpoints of safety and tolerability of the combination regimen. At AASLD 2022, we and Arbutus Biopharma presented an interim analysis of on-treatment data from Study 204. In February 2023, in consultation with Arbutus Biopharma, the companies decided to terminate Study 204 early, at the end of the 48-week on-treatment period, and we are in the process of closing the study.
 2158
 2158 was a first-generation CI with a chemical scaffold novel and distinct from VBR and both of our next-generation CI product candidates, 3733 and 4334. In September 2021, we discontinued development of 2158 following the observation of elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels in the Phase 2 clinical study consistent with drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
 Core Inhibitor Collaboration and License Agreements
 Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation
 In September 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the IURTC License Agreement) with Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation (IURTC) pursuant to which we acquired, with rights to sublicense, the rights to develop and commercialize products associated with multiple patents and patent applications covering aspects of our HBV program held by IURTC. As part of this agreement, we are obligated to make milestone payments based upon the successful accomplishment of clinical and regulatory milestones. The aggregate amount of all

performance milestone payments under the IURTC License Agreement, should all performance milestones through development be met, is $0.8 million, with a portion having been paid. Under the IURTC License Agreement, we are also obligated to pay IURTC royalties based on net sales of the licensed technology ranging from 0.5% to 1.75%. In addition, under the IURTC License Agreement, we pay annual diligence maintenance fees of $0.1 million. Milestone payments received by IURTC are fully creditable against the annual diligence maintenance fee for the year in which the milestone payments are received.
 The IURTC License Agreement may be terminated by us, with or without cause, upon 90 days advance written notice, by IURTC upon our material breach with 60 days advance written notice or by IURTC, in certain cases, upon our insolvency or bankruptcy immediately upon written notice.
 BeiGene, Ltd.
 In July 2020, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with BeiGene, granting BeiGene an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop and commercialize products containing VBR, 2158 and 3733 (the BeiGene Agreement) in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau (the Territory).
 Under the BeiGene Agreement, we and BeiGene will collaborate on development activities with respect to the licensed products in accordance with a mutually agreed upon development plan.
Pursuant to the terms of the BeiGene Agreement, BeiGene paid us an upfront amount of $40.0 million, and we were eligible to receive up to approximately $500.0 million in milestone payments, comprised of up to $113.8 million in development and regulatory and $385.0 million in net sales milestone payments. In September 2021, we discontinued development of 2158 following the observation of elevated ALT levels in the Phase 2 clinical study consistent with drug-induced hepatotoxicity, and in July 2022, we discontinued VBR because it did not achieve functional cure or finite treatment in our two- and three-drug combination studies. Due to the discontinuation of development of VBR and 2158, the maximum cash milestone payments we are eligible to receive for 3733 are $285.0 million, comprised of up to $65.0 million for development and regulatory milestones and up to $220.0 million in net sales milestones. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties at percentages ranging from the mid-teens to the low 30s of net sales. BeiGene has also agreed to pay all development and regulatory costs up to an aggregate of $45.0 million in the Territory for VBR, 2158 and 3733. Following this initial investment, we and BeiGene will share development costs for the Territory equally.
 The BeiGene Agreement also contains provisions such as representations and warranties of the parties, terms as to governance of the collaboration, commercialization and regulatory responsibilities of the parties, and manufacturing and supply, including potential adjustments in the event supply costs exceed certain levels. In addition, during the term of the BeiGene Agreement, neither party will commercialize any competing products in the Territory.
 Under the terms of the BeiGene Agreement, if after 3733 reaches the end of Phase 2 clinical trials, we and BeiGene are unable to mutually agree on the terms of a Phase 3 global study, BeiGene may elect to terminate the BeiGene Agreement solely as it relates to that compound. Such a termination would result in us regaining all rights to the applicable compound in the Territory. In addition, BeiGene may terminate the BeiGene Agreement for convenience at any time upon 90 days’ advance written notice to us. The BeiGene Agreement also contains customary provisions for termination by either party, including in the event of breach of the BeiGene Agreement, subject to cure.
 HBV/HDV Entry Inhibitor
 In March 2022, we announced our research program focused on a novel, orally bioavailable small molecule approach to inhibit entry of HBV and HDV. While HDV is less prevalent in the United States, it is a significant and serious health problem with inadequate treatment in many parts of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, East Asia and parts of South America. HDV is known to accelerate disease progression and increase the incidence of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer, which results in higher morbidity and mortality rates than HBV alone. The current standard of care treatment for HDV is off-label pegylated IFN-α injected weekly or, in some regions, a large, complex molecule that requires daily injections. We believe a safe and effective oral small molecule entry inhibitor would be a significant innovation for patients living with HDV. Our research team has identified a potential opportunity to develop a safe and effective oral small molecule viral entry inhibitor, which could significantly improve convenience and potentially enhance treatment uptake and diagnosis rates. Based on current progress, our aim is to nominate a product candidate for

development in 2023. At AASLD 2022, we presented the preclinical characterization of our novel class of highly potent small molecule HBV/HDV entry inhibitors.
 IFNAR Agonist
 In July 2022, we introduced our new research program advancing a novel, small molecule IFNAR agonist designed to selectively activate the IFN-α pathway within the liver and offer the convenience of oral dosing. IFN-α is a subcutaneous injectable immune modularity therapy approved for HBV that has demonstrated functional cure in some HBV patients, but its poor tolerability profile significantly limits its use. Substantial side effects include flu-like symptoms, cytopenias, serious depression and psychiatric effects. In addition, multiple contraindications limit its use, and it requires weekly injections that result in systemic exposure for up to a year.
By focusing exposure on the liver, our investigational IFNAR agonist program aims to engage interferon-α’s validated antiviral and immune modulatory mechanisms, retaining the efficacy of IFN-α while reducing systemic exposure to improve tolerability. Lead optimization of multiple agonists is progress. At AASLD 2022, we presented the preclinical characterization of our novel liver-focused small molecule agonists efficiently inhibiting HBV by activating type 1 interferon signaling.
 Our Herpesvirus Programs
 In August 2022, in addition to announcing our HBV/HDV inhibitor and IFNAR agonist programs, we introduced our first programs outside of hepatitis, which target HSV-2 and transplant-associated herpesviruses.
 HSV-2
 Up to 40% of patients with genital herpes associated with HSV-2 infection suffer from high-recurrence genital herpes, which results in painful lesions occurring six or more times per year, transmission risk (including neonatal transmission) and increased risk of HIV infection, as well as associated psychological stress.
Helicase-primase inhibitors are antiviral agents with a novel mechanism of action. They inhibit the viral protein complex consisting of helicase, primase, and cofactor subunits, which have functions that are essential for viral DNA replication. These agents are not nucleoside analogues and do not require phosphorylation by the HSV thymidine kinase (TK) to become active drugs; therefore, helicase-primase inhibitors are active immediately upon reactivation of latent HSV. Furthermore, helicase-primase inhibitors are active against TK-deficient HSV, which is a major mechanism of resistance to nucleoside analogues.
Although there are approved antiviral therapies targeting HSV-2, these current therapies are only partially effective in preventing recurrence in patients experiencing high-recurrence genital herpes and require taking one or more pills daily. Due to the limitations of current therapies, we identified an opportunity to develop a potent, long-acting injectable helicase inhibitor with the potential to improve efficacy, convenience and patient compliance. We are targeting long-acting for at least monthly dosing and will continue to evaluate longer dosing intervals as development and formulation progress.
 In February 2023, we nominated a development candidate for our HSV-2 long-acting helicase inhibitor program, 5366, for progression into IND-enabling studies.
 Transplant-Associated Herpesviruses
 In a transplant setting, when patients are experiencing immunosuppression, they are at high risk of uncontrolled viral replication and severe disease brought on by one or more members of the herpesvirus family of viruses including cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus type 1, HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus (VZV). Each of these herpesviruses are highly prevalent, as approximately (1) 60% of the population is CMV-positive; (2) 60% of the population is HSV-positive; and (3) 80% of the population is VZV-positive. These viruses establish lifelong latent infections and frequently reactivate in transplant patients due to immune suppression. These uncontrolled viral infections increase risk of serious complications, including organ rejection and death.
 As with HSV-2, there are approved antivirals that are administered in a transplant setting, but they are limited by a narrow spectrum (no approved drug is effective against all of the herpesviruses indicated above), potentially serious

side effects and significant drug-drug interactions. As a result of these limitations, we identified an opportunity to develop an oral pan-herpes NNPI for these transplant-associated herpesvirus infections, which would greatly simplify treatment. Our research team has discovered multiple series of potent, broad-spectrum herpesvirus polymerase inhibitors.
 Intellectual Property
 We own a U.S. patent application and related foreign patent applications that relate to compositions of matter and methods of using 3733; any patents issuing therefrom are expected to expire in 2039.
 We own an international (PCT) application that relates to compositions of matter and methods of using 4334; any patents issuing therefrom are expected to expire in 2041.
 We also own provisional patent applications relating to compositions of matter, method of using and pharmaceutical formulations of 5366, and provisional patent applications relating to compositions of matter and method of using our HBV/HDV entry inhibitors, IFNAR agonists and pan-herpes NNPIs.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing.
U.S. drug approval process
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable requirements;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in accordance with good clinical practices (GCP), and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA);
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


•FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 Nonclinical studies and IND
 Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of nonclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. For some products, the FDA may waive the need for certain nonclinical tests. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical studies and places the trial on clinical hold. If an IND or clinical study is placed on clinical hold, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to commence.
 Clinical studies
 Clinical studies involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Clinical studies are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical study must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical studies must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (FDORA), which was signed into law on December 29, 2022, made numerous amendments to the FDCA including provisions intended to, among other things, decentralize and modernize clinical trials and enhance diversity in clinical trial populations.
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
 •Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Additionally, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators within 15 calendar days after determining that the information qualifies for reporting. IND safety reports are required for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, findings from animal or in vitro testing or other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. In addition, a sponsor must notify the FDA within seven calendar days after receiving information concerning any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore,

the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 A manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy regarding evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, Fast Track product, or regenerative advanced therapy.
 Marketing approval
 After the completion of required clinical testing, the results of the nonclinical studies and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $3.2 million and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program fee currently set at $0.4 million through September 30, 2023. These fees are typically adjusted on October 1 each year.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission before accepting them for filing to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review of NDAs. Under these goals, the FDA has committed to review most original applications for non-priority products within ten months, and most original applications for priority review products, that is, drugs for a serious or life-threatening condition that the FDA determines represent a significant improvement over existing therapy, within six months. For NDAs for novel products, the ten- and six-month time periods runs from the filing date; for all other original applications, the ten- and six-month time periods run from the submission date. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an NDA to extend beyond the goal date. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drugs or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and integrity of the clinical data submitted. With passage of the FDORA, Congress clarified the FDA’s authority to conduct inspections by expressly permitting inspection of facilities involved in the preparation, conduct, or analysis of clinical and non-clinical studies submitted to FDA as well as other persons holding study records or involved in the study process.
 After the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval and refuse to approve the NDA. Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies,

including Phase 4 clinical studies, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product or impose new labeling, testing or distribution and use requirements. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track designation
 The FDA is required to facilitate and expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 calendar days after receipt of the sponsor’s request.
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product’s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical study process. In 2018, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to VBR for the treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection.
 Priority review
 Under FDA policies, a product candidate may be eligible for priority review, a review generally within a six-month time frame from the time a complete application is received or filed. Products generally are eligible for priority review if they are intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition.
Accelerated approval
 Under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM). In clinical studies, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical studies to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. With the passage of the FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA until completion or termination of the study. FDORA further enables the FDA to initiate criminal prosecutions for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.


Breakthrough therapy designation
 A sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies also may be eligible for priority review. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, as amended, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active moiety to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product and indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. A drug will be considered clinically superior if it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same orphan disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA/BLA application user fee.
 Pediatric information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for drug with certain novel features (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication) must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. A sponsor of a new drug subject to the above pediatric testing requirements also is required to submit to the FDA a pediatric study plan generally 60 days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the agency. Generally, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan drug designation.
 Other regulatory requirements
 Any drug manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements, including REMS, as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical studies, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced

inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REM program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •consent decrees, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs generally may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Physician Drug Samples
 As part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA) regulates the distribution of drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. In addition, the PDMA sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations.
Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical studies, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as

Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Accordingly, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the trials required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product, if approved, does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of us placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 The marketability of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale is dependent on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from government and third-party payors. In addition, the emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. For example the Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, ACA), among other things, imposed an annual fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, under the Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program. In addition to these provisions, the ACA established a number of bodies whose work may have a future impact on the market for certain pharmaceutical products, including the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, established to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, established to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, former President Trump issued directives designed to delay the implementation of certain PPACA provisions or otherwise circumvent requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA, and Congress has considered legislation that would repeal, or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effectively repealed the individual health insurance mandate, which is considered a key component of the ACA. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and because it was repealed as part of the Tax Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. In December 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the lower court decision, which was then appealed to the U.S. Supreme

Court. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that state and individual plaintiffs did not have standing to challenge the individual mandate provision of the ACA; in so holding, the Supreme Court did not consider larger constitutional questions about the validity of this provision or the validity of the ACA in its entirety. Another case challenging the PPACA’s requirement that insurers cover certain preventative services is currently pending before the same U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas who ruled against the individual mandate in 2018. In September 2022, the judge held that certain preventative services violated the U.S. Constitution and set a schedule for additional briefing that continued into January 2023. It is unclear how this or any potential future litigation and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will impact the PPACA. Further, the Trump Administration’s 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on certain high-cost employer-sponsored insurance plans and, on January 1, 2021, eliminated the health insurer tax.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, in January 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent United States Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, enacted on August 16, 2022, seeks to reduce prescription drug costs by, among other provisions, allowing Medicare to negotiate prices for certain high-cost prescription drugs in Medicare Parts B and D, imposing an excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers that refuse to negotiate pricing with Medicare, and requiring inflation rebates to limit annual drug price increases in Medicare. Beginning in 2025, the IRA also eliminates the coverage gap under Medicare Part D by significantly lowering the enrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and imposing on new manufacturer discount program. In addition, in September 2020, the FDA issued a final rule that sets up a legal framework for allowing the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued guidance that addresses the treatment of certain imported drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
 At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, if approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
 Other Healthcare Laws
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, the Company’s business practices, including its research and sales, marketing and scientific/ educational grant programs may be required to comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, the data privacy and security provisions of the Health

Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), federal transparency requirements and similar state laws, each as amended. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other;
 •federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; making a false statement or record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims;
 •HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;
 •HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;
 •the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
 •the U.S. federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs, biologics and medical devices;
 •the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, 


these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; and
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
 Additionally, we are subject to state and non-U.S. equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not just governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties.
 In addition, regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect on May 25, 2018, applies to any company established in the European Union (EU) as well as to those outside the EU if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. Noncompliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process where such processing is subject to the GDPR, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, including as implemented by individual countries.
 California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA will require covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact our business activities. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which went into effect on January 1, 2023, imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and expands consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, among other things. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. Other states, including Virginia and Colorado have similarly passed data privacy laws that will regulate how businesses collect and share personal information.
 New Legislation and Regulations
 From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, and reimbursement status of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is very competitive, and the development and commercialization of new drugs is influenced by rapid technological developments and innovation. We face competition from several companies developing and commercializing products that will be competitive with our drug candidates, including large pharmaceutical and smaller biotechnology companies. Additionally, new entrants may potentially enter the market. Potential competitors include Johnson & Johnson, Roche, Gilead Sciences Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., HEC Pharma, Arbutus Biopharma, Vir Bio, Aligos Therapeutics, AiCuris Anti-infective Cures AG, and Qilu Pharmaceutical, among others. Additionally, we may face competition from currently available HBV treatments. Some of the competitive development programs from these companies may be based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approach, and others may be based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of products similar to ours or that otherwise target indications that we are pursuing.
Manufacturing
 We currently rely on third-party manufacturers to supply the quantities of our investigational product candidates used in our clinical and nonclinical studies. We currently have no plans to establish any manufacturing facilities for our product candidates.
Human Capital Management
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 68 total employees and contracts with a number of temporary contractors, consultants and contract research organizations (CROs). The majority of our employees work out of our facility in South San Francisco, California. We also have a small number of remote employees spread across the United States and one remote employee in the United Kingdom.
 We continually evaluate our needs and make strategic choices regarding whether to hire internal teams or outsource certain functions to CROs or contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), as appropriate. We currently outsource our clinical study management to various CROs and utilize certain CMOs to manufacture both the drug substance and the drug product used in our ongoing and planned clinical studies.
 We compete with both large and small companies in our industry for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill highly specialized needs. We generally target our base salaries and annual performance-based cash bonuses at the 50th percentile of our peers and our long-term equity incentive compensation, which all employees receive, between the 50th and 75th percentiles of our peers. In certain circumstances, we offer compensation above these levels, based on a candidate’s experience, criticality, amount of responsibility and either individual or Company-wide performance. We routinely review our employees’ base salaries to ensure that they remain market competitive. Both annual performance-based cash bonuses and long-term equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on employees’ levels of responsibility. We also offer comprehensive benefits packages to all of our employees, including: 100% Company-covered medical, dental and vision coverage for employees and their families; a 401k program with a Company match; a comprehensive employee assistance program, an employee stock purchase plan; and paid family leave.
 A large majority of our employees have advanced degrees, and we also offer an educational assistance program that reimburses employees up to a maximum amount per year for courses that directly enhance his or her area of professional work or contribute to his or her immediate career growth. This program demonstrates our commitment to analytical growth, enhanced knowledge and professional development.
