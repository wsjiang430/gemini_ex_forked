ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
We are a U.S.-based, independent, pure-play technology foundry that offers advanced semiconductor development and manufacturing services from our fabrication facilities, or fabs, in Bloomington, Minnesota and Kissimmee, Florida. In our technology as a service model, we leverage a strong foundation of proprietary technology to co-develop process technology intellectual property ("IP") with our customers that enables disruptive concepts through our Advanced Technology Services for diverse microelectronics (integrated circuits, or ICs) and related micro- and nanotechnology applications. In addition to differentiated technology development services, we support customers with volume production of ICs for high-growth markets through our Wafer Services.
The combination of semiconductor development and manufacturing services we provide our customers is not available to them from a conventional fab. In addition, we believe our status as a publicly-traded, U.S.-based, pure-play technology foundry with Defense Microelectronics Activity, or DMEA, Category 1A accreditation from the DoD positions us well to provide distinct, competitive advantages to our customers. These advantages include the benefits of enhanced IP security and easy access to a U.S. domestic supply chain. 
We primarily focus on serving diversified, high-growth, end users in numerous vertical markets, including (1) advanced computation, (2) aerospace and defense, or A&D, (3) automotive and transportation, (4) bio-health, (5) consumer and (6) industrial/internet of things, or IoT. By housing both development and manufacturing in a single operation, we rapidly and efficiently transition newly-developed processes to high-yielding volume production, eliminating the time it would otherwise take to transfer production to a third-party fab. Through our Advanced Technology Services, we specialize in co-creating with our customers advanced solutions that directly serve our end markets, such as superconducting ICs for quantum computing and sensing, integrated photonics, carbon nanotube technologies, or CNTs, microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, technologies for biomedical and imaging applications, and advanced packaging. Our Wafer Services include the manufacture of silicon-based analog and mixed-signal ICs for our end markets. Our Advanced Technology Services and Wafer Services customers include Infineon, D-Wave, L3Harris, and Leonardo DRS.
Before we began independent operations, our Minnesota fab was owned and operated by Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, or Cypress, as a captive manufacturing facility for 26 years. We have leveraged the Cypress system, manufacturing technology and process development capabilities to advance our product offerings. We became an independent company in March 2017 when we were acquired by Oxbow Industries, LLC, or Oxbow, as part of a divestiture from Cypress. Our multi-year foundry services agreement with Cypress, which ended in June 2020, created a runway for us to operate the foundry at a high utilization rate while continuing to expand and diversify the customer base initially transferred by Cypress. Cypress was acquired in April 2020 by Infineon Technologies AG, or Infineon.
Before the closing of our initial public offering, or IPO, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to SkyWater Technology, Inc. On April 23, 2021, we completed our IPO and issued 8,004,000 shares of common stock. Shares of our common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market on April 21, 2021 under the symbol “SKYT”.
Our Industry
Microelectronics are the enabling technology of the information age and have served as a conduit for the growth of the electronics industry over the past sixty years. Semiconductors make solid state electronics possible and are vital inputs for products such as computers, communications equipment, consumer products, industrial automation and control systems, military equipment, automobiles, medical equipment and increasingly a broad array of internet- enabled products and devices. As electronics have become more sophisticated and integrated, meeting the demand for semiconductors used in these products has required advances in semiconductor design and manufacturing.
Semiconductor devices are historically classified as either digital or analog based on the type of signals they process. Digital semiconductor devices process discrete, binary (“on-off” or “1-0”) electrical signals that are used for computational or data processing functions and that have driven many of the advances in computing and communication in recent years. By contrast, analog devices condition and regulate “real-world” functions such as temperature, pressure, speed, sound and electrical current. An increasing interest and focus on enabling electronics systems to interact with people has propelled analog processing, a trend which we believe will continue in the future.
To process inputs from analog sensors, digital processing is required to convert these signals into meaningful information. The demand for processing of these analog signals has led to the creation of a semiconductor category known as “mixed-signal,” which processes both analog signals and digital logic. These mixed-signal semiconductors are developed to support the rapidly expanding applications across markets through the emergence of IoT.
Analog and mixed-signal semiconductors as well as derivative and adjacent technologies, such as rad-hard, discrete power devices, carbon nanotubes and microelectronics, such as superconducting, photonics, and MEMS, require higher levels of customizable functionality and performance than digital devices do. Since these analog and mixed-signal devices are produced in lower volumes than digital devices, traditional digital high-volume foundries have been generally unwilling to commit engineering resources to the processes and technologies necessary to innovate beyond their standard process offerings. This has resulted in significant unmet need at a time when demand for these specialty ICs continues to 
grow due to demand from the A&D, automotive and transportation, advanced computation, bio-health, consumer and industrial/IoT applications.
Rad-hard electronics enable electronic devices to be resistant to malfunctions caused by electromagnetic or particle radiation. Traditional semiconductor circuit structures are at a higher risk of damage from radiation, especially in high-radiation environments, such as space, nuclear use cases, weapon systems and high-altitude aircrafts. To modify these circuits to withstand the effects of radiation, manufacturers use extensive development and testing to create circuits that reduce the impact from electromagnetic radiation. As a result, rad-hard ICs are more expensive than traditional ICs. Consequently, most purchasers of rad-hard ICs are well-funded military and scientific organizations or produce products in high-value markets such as medical devices. 
Historically, most semiconductor companies were vertically integrated. They performed all major functions including design, manufacturing, test and assembly, and sales and marketing. These types of semiconductor companies are called integrated device manufacturers, or IDMs.
As the complexity of semiconductor designs has increased over the last several decades, semiconductors have become increasingly challenging to manufacture, requiring both sophisticated manufacturing expertise and exponential increases in fab investments. These requirements have led to the creation of the foundry business model, where the cost of a fab is spread across multiple customers. These economics have driven IDMs to outsource production to foundries and divest their fabs. The industry has therefore matured, consolidated, specialized and evolved to include the following main supplier categories:
•IDMs. Vertically integrated for all major functions including design, manufacturing, test and assembly and sales and marketing. Some of these IDMs also provide foundry services to third parties.
•Fabless Semiconductor Companies. Fabless companies primarily focus on designing semiconductors and outsource the manufacturing of their proprietary design to third-party semiconductor foundries or IDMs using their standard manufacturing process technologies.
•Pure-play Foundries. Pure-play foundries, such as ours, focus exclusively on providing semiconductor manufacturing based on processes and technologies that are developed for other semiconductor companies to utilize for their respective products. Such foundries neither offer nor design their own semiconductor products.
•Packaging Outsourced Assembly and Tests, or OSATs. Also known as OutSourced Assembly and Testers, these companies work in the supply chain downstream of the groups mentioned above, and provide packaging, assembly and testing services. The same trend driving the creation of the fabless semiconductor and pure-play foundry categories described above has indirectly led to the rise of these service providers.
Our Business
We offer a unique, pure-play technology foundry model through Technology-as-a-Service, or TaaS (see following figure), providing innovation to our customers through Advanced Technology Services and 200 mm volume wafer manufacturing capabilities through Wafer Services. By having both services in one operation, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of the market opportunity in our end-market industries, build key market relationships as technology develops, and produce those technologies at scale as adoption expands. One advantage of our combined offering is our ability to develop a technology inside a production environment that stabilizes the production line with extensive controls managed by the operations and maintenance teams. These tools and process technology are exercised by the baseline production business, which enables quick cycles of learning and reproducible results. Furthermore, once a technology is developed inside this production environment, the ramp to commercial production is expeditious as it is unimpeded by the transfer to an outside production facility that typically follows development inside a prototyping facility. Our combined business model also takes advantage of amortizing costs of the production facility across the entire business, which allows us to have access to production-grade tooling and systems without significant capital and operating costs.
Advanced Technology Services
We deliver Advanced Technology Services to co-create advanced technologies with our customers by providing engineering and process development support. Our programs focus on the next wave of microelectronics technologies, including carbon nanotube transistors, infrared imaging, superconductors, integrated photonics and 3D integration. These technologies are brought online inside a production environment that reduces the process development timeline needed to manufacture at production level scale and yield quality. This gives our customers a significant time-to-market advantage by avoiding a process transfer to another site for manufacturing, as well as stabilizing the new technology on the same tooling as will be used in manufacturing.
We have established an IP and service model that is specifically architected to enable a high degree of collaboration with innovators to facilitate a strong connection between device and process technologists. We foster collaboration by offering a diverse range of enablement services that allow us to engage across many technology platforms and with a spectrum of technology maturity levels.
Wafer Services
We offer semiconductor manufacturing services for a wide variety of silicon-based analog and mixed-signal, power discrete, MEMS and rad-hard ICs. It is our opinion that our focus on the differentiated analog and mixed-signal complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor, or CMOS, space supports long product life-cycles and requirements that value performance over cost efficiencies. We also have strong design enablement capabilities that provide customers with the ability to leverage our IP portfolio. We target customers that are underserved by larger foundries and are looking for a foundry partner that can offer the process customization or operational services and flexibility that they need but do not have the buying power to negotiate elsewhere.
In our Wafer Services category for mixed-signal technologies, the base design IP portfolio for S130 and S90 technologies originating from Cypress was licensed via a technology license agreement in 2017. As our technology platforms evolve, we are making investments in process design kit, or PDK, development with industry partners and expanding partnership with critical electronic design automation suppliers alongside emerging relationships with design service and IP suppliers to create and maintain the IP required over the next several years to enable continued customer success.
Further technology and design enablement specialization and differentiation will be aligned with emerging business domains. Examples include industrialization of CNT 3-dimensional system on a chip, or 3D-SoCs, resistive random-access memories, or RAM, and power components integrated into the base S130 and S90 platforms. The enablement for custom technologies is aligned with customers using a variety of models. These in turn can support emerging applications across the medical, automotive and standard foundry markets.
Our model depicted in the figure below employs this multi-faceted design enablement ecosystem and our combination of Advanced Technology Services and Wafer Services enables engagement with a wider range of technologies and commercial readiness. During this highly collaborative framework, a strong relationship is built between process and design teams, and significant IP is generated in both of those categories. This is an important defining characteristic of our pure-play technology foundry model.
Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe we are a leader in technology innovation services, and believe that we have significant points of differentiation that will enable us to continue to succeed in the pure-play technology foundry industry. Our core strengths include the following:
•Our status as a publicly-traded, U.S.-based pure-play technology foundry partner with DMEA Category 1A accreditation from the DoD. This status provides us with a strong position to service the aerospace and defense market. Our current and potential aerospace and defense customers are required to comply with a range of information security protocols for protecting sensitive device intellectual property with national security implications. The DoD established the Trusted Foundry Program in 2007 to provide secure access to leading-edge semiconductor technology and to ensure a trusted microelectronics supply chain for sensitive government programs with national security interests. As of January 1, 2023, there were 81 suppliers designated as “Trusted” under this program by the USG. Of those suppliers, we are one of only sixteen foundry companies that have DMEA Trusted Category 1A accreditation through the DoD. In addition, there are other end markets, such as automotive and medical, that value working with a supplier operating within the United States, which offers a high level of protection for IP rights, or that value the convenience and branding advantage of services and products made in the United States.
•Unique IP model that offers customers an end-to-end solution for microelectronics and next-wave technology needs. We believe our pure-play technology foundry model combines the integrated process technology development services and manufacturing capability and expertise needed to address the high levels of customization specified by our customers. By combining our development lab capabilities in an advanced volume production fab, we are able to leverage our Advanced Technology Services to accelerate our customers’ time-to-market. We work alongside our customers to co-create customized ICs to meet or exceed stringent semiconductor requirements. By providing a full-scale semiconductor technology and manufacturing ecosystem, with substantial process flow integration and customized solutions, we are able to continually attract and retain customers.
•Accelerated time-to-market advantage for our customers. Our integration of development and manufacturing into a single ecosystem enables our customers’ products to be designed for manufacturing robustness without sacrificing the unique customization needed for differentiation. In addition, our wafer fab offers rapid prototyping and validation and accommodates small lot manufacturing, making our facility an optimal size for providing a complete solution for our customers and allowing them the opportunity to access the market more quickly than with other semiconductor foundries.
•A seasoned engineering team that leverages our extensive IP portfolio to support the development of emerging technologies in a fully integrated lab-to-fab environment. Our team of over 100 engineers employs intellectual property created over decades, and our fab is specially geared toward managing the complexity of developing emerging technologies alongside manufacturing with world-class excellence. Through direct collaboration with our customers, our team of engineers can leverage existing wafer process technology and process flow options to create custom fabrication processes that best serve our customers’ needs for high-performance analog and mixed-signal ICs. We also specialize in developing advanced processes for emerging technologies such as silicon photonics, superconducting and quantum computing, CMOS image sensing and DNA sequencing, among others. Our Advanced Technology Services provide us with a competitive advantage by offering significant technical expertise and customized engineering practices required for the creation and delivery of scalable specialty applications. The technological capabilities of our foundry shorten design cycles to create an expedited path for our customers’ products to reach the market.
•Optimized manufacturing environment for highly-engineered projects. Customers in our end markets value high performance and are willing to pay a premium for the Advanced Technology Services needed for the development of specialized products. Many of our customers are focused on high-margin specialty applications, which typically involve a smaller volume of production. We believe such customers are underserved by our competitors, which primarily focus on higher-volume opportunities. Our high-mix foundry automation and manufacturing systems are geared to handle high levels of customization, making smaller volume projects more economical than for competitive fabs. Our right-sized fab provides opportunities for us to leverage our manufacturing scale and expertise for customized processes and to realize higher margins for the significant engineering effort required by these complicated projects.
•Expertise in highly customized projects in a low-volume research and development environment. We specialize in, and have the equipment and process expertise necessary to deliver, effective and cost-efficient solutions while co-creating next-generation technology with our customers. We couple our Advanced Technology Services with existing PDKs that leverage proven intellectual property acquired in our divestiture from Cypress to allow our customers to co-create tailored product offerings. Our technical experience enables us to either modify existing processes or develop new, innovative solutions that are tailored to our customers’ needs. The ability of our competitors to engage in highly customized process development activities within their large-scale manufacturing operations is not feasible without the significant IP and capital expenditures required to retrofit the larger operations for the high-mix and logistically complex requirements of the technology foundry model. Our 200 mm manufacturing lines deliver a degree of agility that allows us to efficiently customize projects without significant lead-times or capital investment, and provides us with the ability to complete rapid prototyping that can quickly translate to volume production. With substantial experience in complex high-mix, mid-market manufacturing, we have consistently demonstrated our ability through deployment of our Advanced Technology Services to excel in customer programs that require specialty knowledge and expertise.
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to become a prominent U.S.-based pure-play technology foundry by leveraging our core competencies in specialty process development and advanced manufacturing, while expanding our customer base and presence in high-margin end markets. To achieve this goal, we intend to pursue the following key strategies:
•Diversify our customer base, grow our presence in existing markets, and expand into new end markets. Our Trusted Foundry designation, various industry accreditations and broad range of capabilities and services have established our presence in high-growth specialty applications. We have reduced our revenue concentration from Infineon to approximately 28% of our revenues for the year ended January 1, 2023 from approximately 100% of our revenues from the period of acquisition to July 1, 2017. We intend to continue to build upon our success in the advanced computation, A&D, automotive and transportation, bio-health, consumer and industrial/IoT markets while expanding into new markets over time. Our technology foundry services, coupled with our Trusted Foundry designation and various industry accreditations, offer unique value to our customers that we plan to leverage as we expand our presence across both current and new end markets.
•Leverage our Trusted Foundry status and find USG investments to add to our capabilities and expand our markets. We are one of only sixteen companies that have DMEA Category 1A Trusted Foundry accreditation through the DoD. We believe most foundries are not positioned to deeply partner with the USG because of the Trusted Foundry’s security requirements, stringent government contract provisions and small lot manufacturing typical of government contracts. We have extensive experience working with highly-sensitive government projects that enable new capabilities and subsequently re-applying those capabilities to expand our market. In 2018, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, awarded the largest contract in the agency’s Electronics Resurgence Initiative, or ERI, program to a team consisting of SkyWater, MIT and Stanford University, for the 3DSoC program. We will continue to evaluate these government opportunities as the USG invests to regain global technology leadership in the semiconductor industry by optimizing and securing its IC manufacturing supply chain.
•Expand in the microelectronics value chain and champion U.S.-based pure-play advanced packaging foundry services. As our industry evolves, we believe 2.5D, 3D, and System-in-Package, or SiP, advanced packaging concepts will be adopted broadly and our domestic offering for development and manufacturing of solutions in this space will be in high demand. Furthermore, our strategy is to make these services available not only to our customers developing highly differentiated and disruptive front-end technologies but also to advanced packaging services that may source chips from other foundries and seek our support for onshore heterogeneous integration solutions. In addition, as interest grows within the federal government to enhance domestic infrastructure in this area, we believe we are well-positioned to lead efforts to position the U.S. as a leader in advanced packaging technology.
•Expand in the rad-hard market. There are increasing uses for various radiation-hardened applications across multiple industries. In September 2019, we received a DoD contract for up to $170 million and in August 2022, we received a phase II contract for up to an additional $99 million to build a next-generation rad-hard chip manufacturing capability. We believe our fab’s lower capital requirements will provide an attractive opportunity for future projects of this nature.
•Co-develop next-generation technologies with our customers, and grow our Advanced Technology Services. We intend to continue to engage in advanced development opportunities and leverage technologies developed to broaden our portfolio of semiconductor solutions. Access to our engineering team, production-grade technology 
and equipment, verified IP and trade secrets developed over several decades enable us to provide highly differentiated and customized process development and Advanced Technology Services. We believe that investing in these capabilities will enable us to maintain our market leadership and attract customers that require lower volumes and intricate engineering specifications.
•Invest in design block IP development and enable third-party creation of IP. The foundation of a PDK-driven foundry offering for wafer services is a comprehensive library of silicon-proven, well-characterized design IP blocks. We will continue to invest in IP blocks organically, through targeted external investments, by encouraging IP design companies to offer their blocks for use with customer-paid royalties.
•Expand our capabilities through cost-effective capital management, including seeking M&A opportunities to drive growth. We will continue to invest in additional manufacturing capacity and evaluate growth opportunities through acquisitions of other businesses and operations, including, with respect to (1) other foundries, (2) larger foundries looking to divest existing low-volume programs, (3) low-cost manufacturing capacity that increases our scale, and (4) adjacent markets such as advanced packaging, or AP, and bond/assembly/test, or BAT. We also may expand our current facility or convert existing spaces into clean rooms to add to our contaminant-free manufacturing environment. We believe acquiring low-cost U.S.-based facilities will expand our scale and customer base while maintaining our domestic competitive advantage without disrupting current operations.
•Expand our capabilities and capacity leveraging the CHIPS and Science Act. On August 9, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors, or CHIPS, and Science Act, which provides $52 billion in incentives for U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, funding for research, and up to 25% in refundable tax credits for semiconductor equipment and upgrades to manufacturing facilities. The stated goal of this legislation is to increase domestic semiconductor production, reinvigorate semiconductor research, and expand the semiconductor workforce, all with a focus on improving economic and national security. We believe SkyWater is well-positioned to take advantage of this landmark legislation, across both our Advanced Technology Services and Wafer Services business lines, because of our demonstrated business model of serving defense and commercial markets across development and production parts of the technology lifecycle. In July 2022, we announced our plans to build a production and research and development facility in West Lafayette, Indiana through a public-private partnership with the State of Indiana and Purdue University. In addition, we are considering site expansions of our existing facilities in Minnesota and Florida.
Our Customers
We serve a diverse array of customers, ranging from designers producing near-commodity volume chips to those requiring highly-specialized, next-wave technology solutions. Infineon accounted for 28% and 25% of our revenue for the years ended January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. Two customers, other than Infineon, represented 20% and 11% of our revenue for the year ended January 1, 2023. One customer, other than Infineon, represented 24% of our revenue for the year ended January 2, 2022. 
Our Platform Technologies
We deliver our Advanced Technology Services and Wafer Services through a wide range of proprietary platform process technologies that are targeted to multiple markets. The table below summarizes the platform technologies and the corresponding target markets.
Analog and Mixed-Signal Based Technologies
Our S90 (90 nm gate length), S130 (130 nm) and CMOS process flows (greater than 130 nm) are the foundation of our business. These process flows have collectively produced a multitude of devices at our fab for products across a range of applications including IoT, memory, automotive, consumer wearables, and vision systems. Our process technology enables application specific integrated circuit, or ASIC, designers to produce a wide range of system-on-chip devices, or SoCs, with embedded memory. Further, we possess unique IP technology acquired from Cypress, which is anticipated to drive additional demand with IoT customers. With the deployment of 5G networks, we expect an increase in IoT devices leveraging 5G for smart sensors and connectivity applications with low power device capabilities. We offer a set of solutions for these applications with an ideal mix of digital and analog performance and a mature field of portable IP.
Rad-Hard CMOS
Our rad-hard technology is used extensively in microelectronics and mission-critical applications across aerospace & defense and bio-health end markets. We have a long legacy of supporting rad-hard CMOS. In 2019, we were awarded rad-hard program by the DoD of up to $170 million and, in 2022, we were awarded up to $99 million in additional funding to fund a facility expansion to house and develop a new 90 nm radiation hardened by process (RHBP) mixed-signal CMOS process that is expected to be qualified for production in early 2025. This new process technology, which is forecasted to double the performance of devices, is expected to become the most advanced strategic RHBP foundry in the United States. Furthermore, this RH90 platform uses the already- proven 90 nm fully depleted silicon-on insulator, or FDSOI, frontend process licensed from MIT-Lincoln Laboratory, where the FDSOI architecture provides improved radiation tolerance, higher transistor speed, and lower power operation. This contract also includes an option for the DoD to fund enhancements and extensions to this technology.
Discrete Power Devices
We believe our fab capabilities are well-suited for high-volume manufacturing of various discrete switching devices used in power management applications including metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFETS, insulated-gate bipolar transistors, or IGBTs, transient-voltage-suppression, or TVS, diodes and comparable topologies. These technologies are in high demand and growing as semiconductor content grows across product categories. These less-complex devices typically require fewer mask layers than full CMOS IC flows and thus afford us the ability to produce these and other low mask count devices structures in relatively high volumes. This product category has seen continued innovation and investment in device performance and process integration, and is ideally aligned with our Advanced Technology Services which are often needed for new devices architectures. We have licensing agreements and partnerships with fabless design companies that utilize our fab to manufacture a wide variety of discrete power devices for the general market, along with one partnership to offer radiation-hardened discrete power devices.
Advanced Packaging & Silicon Interposers
While transistor scaling is slowing and the industry at large considers new avenues for improving system performance while defraying costs, advanced semiconductor packaging is providing a solution for end markets such as computing, communications and aerospace & defense. This has created a large market opportunity which we believe we are well-positioned to address through our proprietary IP. Our silicon interposer process has a variety of advantages over traditional printed circuit board implementations including improved size, speed, power, thermal matching and excellent reliability, among others. 
Our foundational mixed-signal CMOS platforms and developing copper interconnect capability align well with various requirements for passive and active solutions. Our approach confers cost, yield and IP reuse benefits that combine with recent advances in interposer interconnect standards that lower the cost and improve the speed of interconnected signals routed through the interposer as well as increase the level of security. Our Florida facility adds unique interposer technology licensed from IMEC and we expect it to also accelerate our roadmaps for other key technologies in this category including hybrid bonding, fan-out wafer level packaging (FOWLP) and assembly/test. In October 2021, we announced a license and transfer agreement with Deca Technologies to establish our Florida site as the onshore source for Deca’s second generation M-SeriesTM FOWLP technology. 
In May 2022, we announced a licensing agreement with Xperi (now Adeia) for their state of the art ZiBond® wafer bonding and DBI® hybrid wafer bonding technologies, establishing a key assembly technology for our heterogeneous integration strategy
Heterogeneous integration technologies are gaining traction in the advanced computing field to combine chips produced with different process technologies in order to achieve improved performance at the system level with attractive economics. This methodology requires integration of disparate devices using various wafer level and 2.5D and 3D integration and packaging concepts, which in turn requires new manufacturing flows and corresponding business offerings.
Superconducting
Since our initial partnership with D-Wave in 2013, we have been a leading superconducting process flow developer. We have expanded our customer base in this market to include numerous other companies as they develop their own proprietary superconducting technologies for both quantum computing, quantum sensing Qubits and supercomputing applications. For example, in order to address non-traditional architectures required by quantum computing, D-Wave’s device team co-created superconducting qubits based on new materials, new devices and new architecture in order to develop efficiently, enable manufacturing and maintain confidence that their IP remains highly-competitive. D-Wave is now a leader in quantum computing hardware and cloud services and formed a partnership with Amazon Web Services in 2020 for cloud quantum computing services. We also support customers developing superconducting microelectronics for 
non-quantum devices for supercomputing applications where the use of zero-resistance architectures can significantly reduce the staggering amount of energy consumption used by today’s supercomputers and data centers.
3DSoC & Carbon Nanotube Transistors
In 2018, DARPA awarded the largest contract in the agency’s ERI program to a team consisting of us, MIT and Stanford University, for the 3DSoC program. The ERI funding program is focused on restoring U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing technologies.
The 3DSoC initiative was focused on transitioning technology concepts demonstrated at MIT into a commercial foundry environment at SkyWater and create a multilayer stackup of logic and memory that is interconnected with fine-pitch vias that are only possible with monolithic fabrication. This combination of technologies, which tightly integrates memory with digital logic, is predicted to overcome the performance “memory wall” which is currently slowing device performance gains. The technology has disruptive potential due to facilitating leading-edge computing performance at a fraction of leading-edge costs, along with improved power and performance.
With the improved power and performance made possible through the 3DSoC program, we have the capability to apply this technology in areas such as computing, IoT and aerospace & defense.
Silicon Photonics
Optical data transmissions are pushing further into our digital infrastructure, including in data center interconnect data transmission and also within-chip data process domains to increase computation throughput.
We co-create unique solutions for customers in a range of applications, including high-speed data links, such as 100G, and 400G, light detection and ranging, or LiDAR, phased-array photonics, and photon-based quantum computing. Today, we focus on serving photonics with fabrication of low-loss waveguides with integrated detectors, optical modulators, grating couplers, phase modulators, and passive alignment fiber couplers. With the recent addition of a deep trench etching capability, we can serve a larger range of photonics capabilities in our facility. In addition, we see further potential for integration of active photonics light source elements, along with integration of these architectures with our foundational CMOS technologies to unlock inherent performance gains and lower overall system cost structure with this integration.
MEMS
We have supported MEMS fabrication since 2013 for microfluidic applications for DNA sequencing applications and have co-developed a process flow for a highly sensitive infrared imager. The infrared imager was so well-received that many subsequent USG-funded and customer-funded enhancements have pushed the performance of infrared imaging performance to even higher levels. In 2020, we added deep-trench etching capability which enables us to serve a variety of MEMS customers. This expansion has yielded new opportunities for revenue growth by allowing us to address a new market.
Manufacturing
Process Technologies. In our Minnesota facility’s 200 mm fab, process flow for a number of different node dimensions is offered ranging from 90 nm—350 nm. Given that high performance analog and mixed-signal applications do not typically benefit from the advanced node dimensions, we believe we are well-positioned to service IoT markets with high-performance analog and mixed-signal solutions on 90 nm and 130 nm process flows. 
Operational Capabilities. Managing the technology foundry’s signature high-mix manufacturing operation requires special competencies with respect to the manner by which the volume production activities flow through the fab, while experimental and development efforts are interspaced on the same equipment sets. This capability has been developed within our organization over decades as the site was previously the center for Cypress process development and volume manufacturing. A unique operational model also has been developed for fab asset-tracking and equipment ownership to ensure efficient operations despite, at times, competing interests within the fab. 
Equipment. Front-end semiconductor foundry wafer manufacturing services utilize unique combinations of film process steps including photolithography, film deposition, etching and ion implantation. We maintain the equipment sets to support these processing steps and maintain a skilled internal staff to service and repair equipment to enable the 24/7 manufacturing operation. Onsite capabilities also exist for wafer testing which support our quality programs and customer required acceptance testing. As described above, government and customer programs are adding a wide variety of capabilities.
Raw materials. As a manufacturer of high precision products, we maintain critical supplier relationships to ensure high quality starting materials are available to be used in our processing activities. These raw materials include silicon wafers, high-purity compressed gases, high-purity metals for film deposition processes, high-purity acid, base, and cleaning solutions for various wet processing steps, and semiconductor grade photoresist and developer for photolithography. Our principal suppliers for these materials are:
•Globalwafers Co. LTD. (silicon wafers)
•SEH America Inc, subsidiary of Shin-Etsu Handotai, Ltd. (silicon wafers)
•Honeywell Electronic Materials, Inc. (metal sputtering targets)

•Rohm and Haas EM LLC (a subsidiary of DuPont) (photoresist)
•JSR Micro Inc. (photoresist)
•Tokyo Ohka Kogyo America, Inc. (photoresist)
•Moses Lake Industries Inc. (developer)
Certifications. We maintain several quality certifications, including industry-specific certifications required to supply products into safety-sensitive applications. These certifications require extensive information system handling audits to verify business processes ensuring best practices are followed to enable devices to be manufactured at low defect levels and with traceability to ensure individual die can be traced from foundry manufacturing process steps through their life in their real-life use cases. Our current certifications for our Minnesota facility include the following:
•ISO 9001:2015
•IATF 16949:2016 (Automotive)
•ISO 14001:2015
•RoHS Directive 2011/2015
•ISO 13485 (Medical)
•ISO9100 (Aviation, Space & Defense)
Our SkyWater Florida facility has also achieved IS09001:2015 certification and we are working on expanding the certifications to meet additional customer requirements. 
Our Competition
We compete internationally and domestically with dedicated foundry service providers as well as with these IDMs which have in-house semiconductor manufacturing capacity or foundry operations. Many of our competitors in the conventional foundry or IDM categories have substantial production, financial, research and development and marketing resources. These competitors include the “mega” foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, United Microelectronics Corporation and Intel Corporation, as well as specialty foundries such as Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation, Tower Semiconductor Ltd. and XFAB Silicon Foundries SE.
In the aerospace and defense foundry market, our competition includes fabs which partner with major U.S. defense contractors. While these fabs will continue to serve the critical, but often boutique, needs of the USG, we expect the USG and defense community to gradually shift to more economical routes to serve their mission. Other competition in this market includes U.S.-based commercial IDMs and foundries, such as ON Semiconductor Corporation, Tower Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Global Foundries Inc. Other competitors for technology services may include prototype fabs/labs such as MIT Lincoln Labs, IMEC, Fraunhofer, and CEA-Leti.
Our Advanced Technology Services category is highly distinguished, and we do not believe there is a directly competitive offering in the market today. There are alternative solutions for concept demonstration and feasibility work with vastly contrasting value propositions that include university, government or corporate laboratories. These options lack manufacturing expertise and scale to take customers to market and do not have the same position to support design for manufacturability from an early point in the development cycle as their facilities do not support quality focused manufacturing. In contrast, our TaaS model accelerates new technologies to market by streamlining the development and scaleup activities for our customers.
The principal elements of competition in the semiconductor wafer foundry industry include: technical competence; production speed and cycle time; time-to-market; research and development quality; available capacity; fab and manufacturing yields; customer service; price; management expertise; and strategic relationships.
We believe that our custom end-to-end non-recurring engineering, manufacturing, scalable production, U.S. location and the flexibility built into our core process positions us as a “right sized” fab for diverse projects of all sizes and is a key differentiator within the market.
Our ability to compete successfully also depends on factors outside of our direct control, including industry and general economic trends. Any significant increase in competition may erode our profit margins, weaken earnings or increase losses. If we cannot compete successfully in our industry, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
Sales and Marketing
Sales. Our sales processes are driven by the typical electronic system design cycle and follow standard project phases including scoping, prototyping, evaluation and qualification, and production. Variations of this cycle are common as unique customer purchasing cycles exist in different engagements across government programs and public versus private company customer types. The multi-phase purchase process results in sales cycles ranging from several months to more than a year from initial contact to volume production. In addition, for Advanced Technology Services sales engagements of next-wave technologies, close relationships are built while serving our unique Advanced Technology Services due to close collaboration between technical teams as well as business leaders in order to monitor progress and drive engagements forward. Customer relationships are important due to the long sales cycles. Our sales and business development staff members possess significant technical competence and well-developed interpersonal skills to win and maintain customer relationships. This differentiates our front-end business organization from conventional foundries. Our highly technical 
staff members serve in customer-facing roles early and often in engagements in order to communicate the value of these services during a customer’s decision process.
Marketing. Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing industry awareness of our corporate value proposition and our product offerings, customer engagement and ultimately converting need into demand that can be captured by the sales team. In support of these objectives, we are focused on investing in operational capabilities to help us define markets for our offerings guided by a marketing funnel that measures our marketing performance and return on investment as customers progress through stages of awareness, interest, consideration, intent, evaluation and eventually, purchase. These efforts benefit customers by helping them in pre-purchase stages to understand our offering and how it may benefit their objectives and serves to indicate to us the state of interest of various customers so that we can engage sales resources with them as their plans evolve. In addition, the nature of our business-to-business relationships provides for a unique customer purchase process in which numerous stakeholders participate. These stakeholders usually represent various parts of the customer’s business and engage with different parts of our organization. This means that building a strong brand reputation, which is consistent across all types of the customer experience, is important and presents the opportunity to differentiate our organization from our competition as we efficiently and consistently meet various customer needs across all engagement types.
Intellectual Property and Research and Development
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology. We also rely on a number of registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our brand. 
In addition, we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by requiring our employees and independent contractors involved in development of intellectual property on our behalf to enter into agreements acknowledging that all works or other intellectual property generated or conceived by them on our behalf are our property, and assigning to us any rights, including intellectual property rights, that they may claim or otherwise have in those works or property, to the extent allowable under applicable law.
Despite our efforts to protect our technology and proprietary rights through intellectual property rights, licenses and other contractual protections, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other technology. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our international operations, and effective intellectual property, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Further, companies in the communications, technology, and other industries in which we operate may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks and may frequently threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. In the future, we may also face allegations that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of third parties. 
We have also made significant investments in research and development for our platform. Our research and development activities seek to upgrade and improve our manufacturing technologies and processes. A substantial portion of our research and development activities are undertaken in cooperation with our customers and equipment vendors. Due to the rapid changes in technology that characterize the semiconductor industry, effective research and development is essential to our success. We plan to continue to invest significantly in research and development activities in order to develop advanced process technologies for new applications. Our research and development expenses were approximately $9.4 million, $8.7 million, and $4.2 million, for the years ended January 1, 2023, January 2, 2022, and January 3, 2021, respectively.
Environmental, Safety and Quality Matters
We use, generate and discharge hazardous chemicals and waste in our research and development and manufacturing activities. United States federal, state and local regulations, in addition to those of other foreign countries in which we operate, impose various environmental rules and obligations, which are becoming increasingly stringent over time, intended to protect the environment and in particular to regulate the management and disposal of hazardous substances. As a result, our facilities are ISO 14001 certified, an international standard that provides management guidance on how to achieve an effective environmental management system.
We also face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and other hazardous substances that apply to specified electronic products put on the market in the European Union (Restriction on the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC, also known as the RoHS Directive) and similar legislation in California. Other laws impose liability on owners and operators of real property for any contamination of the property even if they did not cause or know of the contamination. While to date we have not experienced any material adverse impact on our business from environmental regulations, we cannot provide assurance that environmental regulations will not impose expensive obligations on us in the future, or otherwise result in the incurrence of liabilities such as the following:
•a requirement to increase capital or other costs to comply with such regulations or to restrict discharges;
•liabilities to our employees and/or third parties; and
•business interruptions as a consequence of permit suspensions or revocations, or as a consequence of the granting of injunctions requested by governmental agencies or private parties.
We have placed significant emphasis on achieving and maintaining a high standard of manufacturing quality. Our facilities are ISO 9001 certified, an international quality standard that provides guidance to achieve an effective quality management system. In addition, our facilities are TS16949 certified. As previously discussed, our facilities also have been accredited as a Category 1A Trusted Fab for fabrication, design and testing of DoD Trusted Microelectronics.
Our facilities are currently pursuing ISO45001 certification, which recognizes compliance with international occupational health and safety standards that provide guidance on how to achieve an effective health and safety management system. The health and safety standard management system assists in evaluating compliance status with all applicable health and safety laws and regulations as well as establishing preventative and control measures. We believe we are currently in compliance with all applicable health and safety laws and regulations. 
Our goal in implementing ISO45001, ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and TS16949 systems is to continually improve our environmental, health, safety and quality management systems. We are committed to environmental, social and governance best practices with a company-wide focus on sustainability through diverse initiatives and activities.
Human Capital Resources
As of January 1, 2023, we had 706 employees. All employees reside in the United States of America.
Our goal is to attract and retain highly qualified, passionate and agile personnel. On occasion we will employ independent contractors to support our efforts. None of our employees or contractors are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good and we have never experienced a work stoppage.
Our human capital management objectives are to acquire, engage, develop and retain our top talent. We are committed to fostering an environment where all employees can grow and thrive. A diverse workforce results in a broader range of perspectives, helping drive our commitment to growth. We believe that our compensation and benefit programs are appropriately designed to attract and retain qualified talent. To create and maintain a successful work environment, we offer an annual base salary and a comprehensive package of additional benefits that support the overall well-being of all our employees and their families. Additionally, we may also grant equity awards to attract, reward and retain key employees to allow for them to share in our overall performance.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions. 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have generally elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period, if, at the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year, or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Securities Exchange Act.
