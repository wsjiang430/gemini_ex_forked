Item 1.    BUSINESS
General

Our business consists principally of marketing, manufacturing and selling floorcovering products to high-end residential customers through our various sales forces and brands. We focus exclusively on the upper-end of the floorcovering market where we believe we have strong brands and competitive advantages with our style and design capabilities and customer relationships. Our Fabrica, Masland, and Dixie Home brands have a significant presence in the high-end residential floorcovering markets.
Our business participates in markets for soft floorcoverings, which include broadloom carpet and rugs, and hard surfaces, which include luxury vinyl flooring (LVF) and engineered wood. There has been a significant shift in the flooring marketplace as hard surface products have grown at a rate much faster than soft surface products. We responded to this accelerated shift to hard surface flooring by launching several initiatives in hard surface offerings. We launched TRUCOR™ and TRUCOR Prime™ offering LVF products. In 2022, we experienced significant growth in sales of our TRUCOR™ family of products, including our new TRUCOR Boardwalk collection, and our Fabrica Wood program. In 2022, we introduced our new decorative programs, 1866 by Masland and Decor by Fabrica, which are targeted at high end, luxury soft surface markets including wool broadloom and decorative rugs. 
We have one reportable segment, Floorcovering. 
Our Brands
Our brands are well known, highly regarded and offer meaningful alternatives to the discriminating customer.
Fabrica markets and manufactures luxurious residential carpet, custom rugs, and engineered wood at selling prices that we believe are approximately five times the average for the residential soft floorcovering industry. Its primary customers are interior decorators and designers, selected retailers and furniture stores, luxury home builders and manufacturers of luxury motor coaches and yachts. Fabrica is among the leading premium brands in the domestic marketplace and is known for styling innovation and unique colors and patterns. Fabrica consists of extremely high quality carpets and area rugs in both nylon and wool, with a wide variety of patterns and textures. Fabrica is viewed by the trade as the premier quality brand for very high-end carpet and enjoys an established reputation as a styling trendsetter and a market leader in providing both custom and designer products to the very high-end residential sector.
Masland Residential, founded in 1866, markets and manufactures design-driven specialty carpets and rugs for the high-end residential marketplace. In addition, it offers luxury vinyl flooring products to the marketplace it serves. Its residential broadloom carpet products are marketed at selling prices that we believe are over three times the average for the residential soft floorcovering industry. Its products are marketed through the interior design community, as well as to consumers through specialty floorcovering retailers. Masland Residential has strong brand recognition within the upper-end residential market. Masland Residential competes through innovative styling, color, product design, quality and service.
Dixie Home provides stylishly designed, differentiated products that offer affordable fashion to residential consumers. Dixie Home markets an array of residential tufted broadloom carpet and rugs to selected retailers and home centers under the Dixie Home and private label brands. In addition, it offers luxury vinyl flooring products to the marketplace it serves. Its objective is to make the Dixie Home brand the choice for styling, service and quality in the more moderately priced sector of the high-end residential market. Its products are marketed at selling prices which we believe average two times the soft floorcovering industry's average selling price.
Industry

We are a flooring manufacturer in an industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals.  In 2021, according to the most recent information available, the U.S. floorcovering industry reported $33.6 billion in sales, up approximately 21.7% from the 2020 sales total. In 2021, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on sales dollars, were carpet and rug (39%), luxury vinyl flooring (LVF) (22%), wood (13%), ceramic tile (12%), stone (6%), vinyl (4%), and laminate and other (4%). In 2021, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on square feet, were carpet and rug (45%), luxury vinyl flooring (LVF) (23%), ceramic tile (13%), vinyl (7%), wood (6%), laminate (4%), and stone and other (2%). Each of these categories is influenced by the residential construction, commercial construction, and residential remodeling markets. These markets are influenced by many factors including consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy.

The carpet and rug category has two primary markets, residential and commercial, with the residential market making up the largest portion of the industry's sales. A substantial portion of industry shipments is made in response to replacement demand. Residential products consist of broadloom carpets and rugs in a broad range of styles, colors and textures. Commercial products consist primarily of broadloom carpet and modular carpet tile for a variety of institutional applications such as office buildings, restaurant chains, schools and other commercial establishments. The carpet industry also manufactures carpet for the automotive, recreational vehicle, small boat and other industries.
The Carpet and Rug Institute (the "CRI") is the national trade association representing carpet and rug manufacturers. Information compiled by the CRI suggests that the domestic carpet and rug industry is comprised of fewer than 100 manufacturers, with a significant majority of the industry's production concentrated in a limited number of manufacturers focused on the lower end of the price curve. We believe that this industry focus provides us with opportunities to capitalize on our competitive strengths in selected markets where innovative styling, design, product differentiation, focused service and limited distribution add value.

Competition

The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. We compete with other carpet, rug and hard surface manufacturers. In addition, the industry provides multiple floorcovering surfaces such as luxury vinyl tile and wood. Though soft floorcovering is still the dominant floorcovering surface, it has gradually lost market share to hard floorcovering surfaces over the last 25 years. We believe our products are among the leaders in styling and design in the high-end residential carpet markets. However, a number of manufacturers produce competitive products and some of these manufacturers have greater financial resources than we do.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our primary floorcovering markets are styling, color, product design, quality and service. In the high-end residential markets, we compete with various other floorcovering suppliers. Nevertheless, we believe we have competitive advantages in several areas. We have an attractive portfolio of brands that we believe are well known, highly regarded by customers and complementary; by being differentiated, we offer meaningful alternatives to the discriminating customer. We believe our investment in new yarns and innovative tufting and dyeing technologies, strengthens our ability to offer product differentiation to our customers. In addition, we have established longstanding relationships with key suppliers of luxury vinyl flooring and with significant customers in most of our markets. Finally, our reputation for innovative design excellence and our experienced management team enhance our competitive position. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of this report.
Backlog

Sales order backlog is not material to understanding our business, due to relatively short lead times for order fulfillment in the markets for the vast majority of our products.
Trademarks

Our floorcovering businesses own a variety of trademarks under which our products are marketed. Among such trademarks, the names "Fabrica", "Masland", "Dixie Home" and TRUCOR™ are of greatest importance to our business. We believe that we have taken adequate steps to protect our interest in all significant trademarks.
Customer and Product Concentration

As a percentage of our net sales, one customer, a mass merchant, accounted for approximately 3% in 2022 and 9% in 2021 and as a percentage of our customer's trade accounts receivable, accounted for approximately 0% in 2022 and 20% in 2021. No customer was more than 10 percent of our net sales during the periods presented. During 2022, sales to our top ten customers accounted for approximately 8% of our sales and our top 20 customers accounted for approximately 12% of our sales. We do not make a material amount of sales in foreign countries.
We do not have any single class of products that accounts for more than 10% of our sales. 
Seasonality

Our sales historically have normally reached their highest level in the second quarter (approximately 26% of our annual sales) and their lowest levels in the first quarter (approximately 23% of our annual sales), with the remaining sales being distributed relatively equally between the third and fourth quarters. Working capital requirements have normally reached their highest levels in the third and fourth quarters of the year.
Environmental

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. The costs of complying with environmental protection laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past. See "Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
Raw Materials

Our primary raw material is continuous filament yarn. Nylon is the primary yarn we utilize and, to a lesser extent, wool and polyester yarn is used. Additionally, we utilize polypropylene carpet backing, latex, dyes and chemicals, and man-made topical applications in the construction of our products. The volatility of petroleum prices could adversely affect our supply and cost of synthetic fibers. Our synthetic yarns are purchased primarily from domestic fiber suppliers and wool is purchased from a number of international sources. Our other raw materials are purchased primarily from domestic suppliers, although the majority of our luxury vinyl tile is sourced outside the United States. Normally, we pass raw material price increases through to our customers; however, there can be no assurance that cost increases can be passed through to customers and that increases in raw material prices will not have an adverse effect on our profitability. See "Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report. There are multiple sources of nylon yarn; however, an unanticipated termination or interruption of our supply arrangements could adversely affect our supplies of raw materials and could have a material effect on our operations. See "Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
Utilities

We use electricity as our principal energy source, with oil or natural gas used in some facilities for dyeing and finishing operations as well as heating. We have not experienced any material problem in obtaining adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or oil. Energy shortages of extended duration could have an adverse effect on our operations, and price volatility could negatively impact future earnings. See "Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
Working Capital

We are required to maintain significant levels of inventory in order to provide the enhanced service levels demanded by the nature of our business and our customers, and to ensure timely delivery of our products. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to maintain such inventory levels. Failure to maintain appropriate levels of inventory could materially adversely affect our relationships with our customers and adversely affect our business. See "Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
Human Capital Resources

At December 31, 2022, our total employed associates was 1,138 which included 138 employees under separation agreements. 
As stated in the Company's Code of Ethics, Company policy is to promote diversity, prohibit discrimination and harassment in the workplace and to provide a safe and healthy workplace for Company associates.
