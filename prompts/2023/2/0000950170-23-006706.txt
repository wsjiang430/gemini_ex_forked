 Overview
 We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on saving teeth from tooth decay, the most prevalent chronic disease globally. We have developed and manufacture the GentleWave® System, an innovative technology platform designed to treat tooth decay by cleaning and disinfecting the microscopic spaces within teeth without the need to remove tooth structure.
 The GentleWave System is a Class II device and has received 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") for preparing, cleaning, and irrigating teeth indicated for root canal therapy ("RCT"). Our initial focus is on leveraging the GentleWave System to transform RCT by addressing the limitations of conventional methods. The key components of our GentleWave System are a sophisticated and mobile console and pre-packaged, sterilized, single-use procedure instruments ("PIs"). The GentleWave System utilizes a proprietary mechanism of action that is designed to combine procedure fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics to efficiently and effectively reach microscopic spaces within teeth and dissolve and remove tissue and bacteria with minimal or no removal of tooth structure. We have invested significant resources in establishing a broad intellectual property portfolio that protects the GentleWave Procedure and its unique mechanism of action, as well as future capabilities under development. As of December 31, 2022, we held 135 issued patents and there were 83 pending patent applications that include device, design, system and method claims.
 We believe our GentleWave System transforms both patient and dental practitioner experience and addresses many of the limitations of conventional RCT by providing the following key benefits:
 Clinical Outcome Benefits
 •Superior cleaning and disinfection.
 •Less invasive procedure.
 •High and rapid rates of healing.
 •Minimal to no post-operative pain.
 Practice and Dental Practitioner Benefits
 •More procedures completed in a single patient visit.
 •Standardized protocol enabling procedure efficiency and predictable outcomes.
 •Simple to use technology.
 •Low risk of cross-contamination.
 •Practice differentiating technology
 Our business is operated through two segments, Product and Software. Our Product segment includes the sales of the GentleWave System console and related accessories and instruments. Our Software segment includes the sales of our traditional software licenses for practice management software to enable an integrated digital office for endodontists.
As of December 31, 2022, we had an installed base of approximately 976 GentleWave Systems that had performed a milestone of more than one million GentleWave patient procedures since commercialization. We generated revenue of $41.7 million and incurred a net loss of $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to revenue of $33.2 million and a net loss of $48.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, our accumulated deficit was $369.1 million.
Milestones Achieved in 2022
 Since the commercialization of our current technology in 2017, we have been focusing on establishing the GentleWave Procedure as the standard of care for RCT. We achieved the following major milestones in 2022:
 •In the second quarter of 2022, we launched our CleanFlow PI, which is designed to work with all GentleWave Systems. With the addition of CleanFlow, the GentleWave Procedure now enables a 


simpler workflow as compared to earlier GentleWave Procedures and helps create a better patient experience. Over time, the CleanFlow PI will replace all existing PIs, creating a more efficient platform.
•In the fourth quarter of 2022, we released our GentleWave G4 System, the next generation of our innovative technology platform designed for an optimized doctor and patient experience to treat tooth decay, demonstrating our continuing commitment to delivering superior clinical results and improving the practitioner experience by delivering innovative products.
 •As of December 31, 2022, with thanks to our dedicated community of GentleWave doctors, over one million patients have now been treated with the GentleWave Procedure since commercialization.


Market Overview
 Tooth decay is the most prevalent chronic disease globally. In the United States, 92% of adults between the ages of 20 and 64 have had dental cavities in their permanent teeth. The incidence of tooth decay has grown significantly over the past several decades, primarily driven by an aging population and unhealthy diets that are high in sugar and other carbohydrates. The United States spends approximately $148 billion annually on professional dental services, of which we estimate that approximately 55%, or $81 billion, of spending is directly associated with treating tooth decay. If left untreated, tooth decay may progress and also result in a number of uncomfortable symptoms, including tooth discoloration, severe toothache or tooth sensitivity, and may eventually lead to tooth loss. Additionally, studies have shown that poor oral health may impact overall health and is associated with diseases such as cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, and pregnancy and birth complications.
 We are initially focused on utilizing our GentleWave System to transform RCT. Our commercial efforts are primarily focused on driving awareness and adoption of our system in our initial target markets of the United States and Canada, where we estimate that approximately 17 million root canal procedures are performed annually, accounting for approximately $17 billion in healthcare-related expenditures. We estimate that there are approximately 5,000 endodontists and 176,000 general dentists in this market. Within the general dentist population, we estimate that a subset of approximately 50,000 general dentists perform approximately 90% of their root canal procedures instead of referring to a specialist. Collectively, we estimate that endodontists and this subset of non-referring general dentists perform more than 75% of all root canal procedures in the United States and Canada. Given the average selling price of our products and our estimates on replacement cycle, and the number of root canals performed annually, we estimate that our total annual addressable market in the United States and Canada is approximately $1.9 billion. We also believe there is a significant opportunity for our GentleWave System in RCT outside the United States and Canada, with more than 50 million root canal procedures performed annually on a global basis including the United States and Canada.
 In addition, we are exploring opportunities to leverage our technology platform beyond RCT to treat cavities in earlier-stage tooth decay, for which we estimate there are approximately 175 million procedures performed in the United States each year. We believe that by utilizing our GentleWave System to treat cavities, the number of general dentists that we target could be expanded to include all 176,000 general dentists in the United States and Canada. We believe treatment for cavities would require separate regulatory approval.
 Our direct sales force markets and sells the GentleWave System to dental practitioners in the United States and Canada, primarily endodontists and general dentists, performing a high volume of root canals as part of their practice. Our commercial strategy and sales model involves a focus on driving adoption of our GentleWave System by increasing our installed base of consoles and maximizing recurring PI revenue through increased utilization. We have been expanding, and will continue to expand the size of our sales and clinician support teams to support our efforts of driving adoption and utilization of the GentleWave System. We also plan to pursue marketing authorizations and similar certifications to enable marketing and engage in other market access initiatives over time in attractive international regions in which we see significant potential opportunity.
 Our Success Factors
 We believe the continued growth of our company will be driven by the following success factors:
 •Paradigm-shifting platform technology for tooth decay, with an initial focus on transforming root canal therapy. We have developed the GentleWave System, an innovative technology platform designed to treat tooth decay and save teeth by cleaning and disinfecting the microscopic spaces within teeth without the need to remove tooth structure. Our initial focus is on transforming RCT by addressing the limitations of conventional methods. Conventional methods of RCT depend primarily on instruments to manually scrape at and remove tooth structure and open the canals inside of the tooth in order to remove and irrigate infected tissue. These methods, however, are limited in their ability to clean the entire root canal system, which increases the risk of treatment failure, and are commonly associated with post-operative pain, which has contributed to patient fear of the procedure. Utilizing our proprietary mechanism of action, which combines fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics, the GentleWave System debrides and disinfects deep regions of the complex root canal system in a less invasive procedure that preserves tooth structure. The GentleWave 


Procedure has been shown to produce favorable clinical outcomes, which we believe provides us an opportunity to transform the patient experience and encourage more patients to choose the GentleWave Procedure. Our goal is to leverage our disruptive technology to establish the GentleWave Procedure as the standard of care for RCT.
 •Large market opportunity with significant need for innovation. As noted above, we estimate that our total annual addressable market in the United States and Canada is approximately $1.9 billion. We are exploring opportunities to leverage our technology platform beyond RCT to treat cavities in earlier-stage tooth decay, for which we estimate there are approximately 175 million procedures performed in the United States each year.
 •Compelling and growing body of clinical and real-world evidence. The clinical benefits delivered by our GentleWave System have been demonstrated across two prospective, multi-center clinical studies, over 30 peer-reviewed journal publications and in real-world, clinical practice, with over one million patients treated using the GentleWave System as of December 31, 2022. Our robust base of peer-reviewed research and clinical data shows that the GentleWave System has delivered strong clinical outcomes, including high and rapid healing rates with minimal to no post-operative pain, and provided superior cleaning of the entire root canal system in a less invasive procedure. For example, we observed a treatment success rate of 97% for patients treated using the GentleWave System in our PURE study, the results of which were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry and Journal of Endodontics. The GentleWave System has also been shown to drive procedure efficiency, enabling a greater proportion of root canal procedures to be completed in a single patient visit and reducing the need for endodontic files. Results from a survey of GentleWave users that we performed in 2020 indicated that the number of root canal procedures performed in a single patient visit increased from 57% to 90% following adoption of the GentleWave System. These survey results are supported by data from our peer-reviewed, prospective clinical studies as well as commercial experience. We believe our compelling and growing body of clinical data and real-world evidence will continue to serve as a catalyst for driving adoption of our GentleWave System.
 •Attractive value proposition for dental practitioners and their patients. We believe the GentleWave System offers a myriad of benefits for dental practitioners and their patients that will facilitate adoption and incorporation into their clinical practice. The clinical benefits of the GentleWave System include superior cleaning and disinfection of the root canal system that is independent of complexity and anatomy, high and rapid rates of healing, minimal to no post-operative pain, a less invasive procedure that enables the preservation of tooth structure and a closed-loop system with a sterilized PI. In addition to the clinical benefits, the GentleWave System offers dental practitioners several other benefits to improve the workflow and economics of their practice. For example, the GentleWave System provides a standardized protocol that promotes procedure efficiency and predictable, consistent outcomes. The GentleWave System also empowers dental practitioners to complete their root canal procedures in a single patient visit, increasing practice efficiency by reducing non-billable patient visits and is also more convenient for patients. In addition, we designed the GentleWave System to be simple to use with an intuitive touchscreen interface, generally requiring only a few days of training before dental practitioners are able to independently perform procedures. We believe these benefits will allow endodontists to establish stronger referral relationships with general dentists and result in improved practice economics for all dental practitioners. 
 •Transformative research and development capabilities and a robust intellectual property portfolio. We have invested significant resources in establishing strong research and development capabilities that are focused on developing simple-to-use solutions. We have also invested significant resources in establishing a broad intellectual property portfolio that protects the GentleWave Procedure and its unique mechanism of action, as well as future capabilities under development. As of December 31, 2022, we had 135 issued patents and 83 pending patent applications that include device, design, system and method claims.
 •Established and growing digital infrastructure to enhance our business. We utilize technology to enhance all elements of our business, from how we engage with clinicians to how we collect and use data. For example, we offer The Digital Office ("TDO"), a practice management software designed to improve practice workflow and seamlessly integrate with the GentleWave System. As of December 31, 


2022, approximately 50% of all GentleWave System clinicians used TDO. In the future, we intend to leverage TDO to allow referring general dentists and patients to schedule consultations and appointments directly with providers of the GentleWave Procedure from our website. In addition to TDO, we have integrated wireless connectivity capabilities into the GentleWave System, allowing for the real-time capture of data. This data is then fed to our proprietary data-warehouse via cloud reporting, providing us with the ability to analyze system usage and utilization. These capabilities also enable automatic software updates and remote diagnostic evaluation.
 •Recurring revenue business model. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our GentleWave Console and related PIs and accessories. Our PIs are sterilized devices with embedded features that do not allow for reuse. Our business model of selling capital equipment that generates corresponding recurring utilization is designed to provide a stream of predictable, recurring revenue.
 Our Growth Strategies
 Our mission statement is "Saving Teeth, Improving Lives." Our goal is to establish the GentleWave Procedure as the standard of care for tooth decay, with an initial focus on transforming RCT. The key elements of our growth strategy are:
 •Execute Our Commercial Strategy in the United States and Canada. 
 oGrow GentleWave install base by increasing awareness and education among dental practitioners and increasing our team of capital sales representatives. We have initially focused on driving adoption of the GentleWave Procedure among endodontists. To drive further adoption of our system, we will continue to increase our team of capital sales representatives, who are focused on system placement by directly engaging with dental practitioners and educating them about the compelling value proposition of the GentleWave Procedure. To facilitate the efforts of our capital sales team, we will strive to increase awareness of the GentleWave Procedure among dental practitioners and their patients by communicating the benefits of our system through various marketing and educational initiatives, including publications and podium presentations at various industry conferences and scientific forums, organizing peer-to-peer dialogue and educational events and leveraging our strong network of supportive key opinion leaders. In addition, we will continue to leverage our relationship with clinicians using TDO who have not yet adopted the GentleWave System into their practices.
 oIncrease utilization of our GentleWave System by partnering with clinicians and increasing awareness among dental practitioners and patients. We intend to increase awareness of the GentleWave Procedure among dental practitioners and, in select markets where we establish a large installed base, directly with patients through various targeted direct-to-patient marketing initiatives, showcasing the benefits and points of difference of the GentleWave Procedure from conventional RCT. We believe that once patients become aware of the GentleWave Procedure, they will seek the GentleWave Procedure over conventional RCT. We believe these initiatives will drive a greater volume of root canal procedures to dental practitioners who offer the GentleWave Procedure, thereby increasing utilization of our system.
 •Reduce product costs and improve production efficiency. We expect to realize operating leverage through increased scale efficiencies as our commercial operations grow. We are undertaking continuous margin improvement programs, including implementing lean manufacturing methods and collaborating with our suppliers to reduce material costs. We have also executed several product design improvements to reduce product cost. For example, we expect further adoption of CleanFlow PI to have a positive impact on the gross margin profile of our PIs. We anticipate that the combination of these strategies will drive margin improvement.
 •Continue to invest in research and development to drive future innovations and expand our addressable market. We are currently developing new features and next generation products to further improve the usability of the GentleWave System and enhance the efficiency and predictability of the GentleWave Procedure. In the future, we intend to pursue marketing authorization to expand the application of our GentleWave System beyond RCT for use in treating cavities in earlier-stage tooth 


decay. By introducing our next-generation innovations, we believe we have an opportunity to leverage and expand our position in the market and add incremental revenue to our business.
 •Grow our footprint into international markets. While our current commercial focus is on the United States and Canada, we believe the GentleWave System can offer compelling benefits to the large population of patients suffering from tooth decay in other international markets. We plan to pursue marketing authorizations and related certifications, and engage in other market access initiatives over time in attractive international regions in which we see significant potential opportunity.
 Our Solution
 We have developed a proprietary technology platform with an innovative approach to the treatment of tooth decay. Our GentleWave System is a Class II device and is FDA-cleared for preparing, cleaning and irrigating teeth indicated for RCT and is the first and only FDA-cleared system for RCT that employs a sterilized, single-use PI to automate the cleaning and disinfection of microscopic spaces within root canals without the need to remove tooth structure.
 In addition to our GentleWave Console and single-use PIs, we also offer ancillary products, such as SoundSeal and our Sonendo-branded liquid solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ("EDTA"). SoundSeal is a material used during the GentleWave Procedure to build and create a sealing platform on the top of the crown, which facilitates an airtight seal between the PI and the tooth. Our company-branded EDTA is used during the GentleWave Procedure to help debride and disinfect the root canal system, and is introduced and circulated throughout the root canal system via the GentleWave System. We also offer our widely used TDO practice management software, which is designed to improve practice workflow and seamlessly integrate with the GentleWave System.
 Benefits of our solution in comparison to conventional RCT
We believe our GentleWave System transforms the patient and clinician experience and addresses many of the limitations of conventional RCT. The following table summarizes the limitations of conventional RCT as compared to the benefits of our GentleWave solution in terms of clinical outcomes and clinical workflow.

Conventional RCT | Our Solution 
Clinical Outcomes: | 
Ineffective cleaning. We believe that conventional methods of RCT do not adequately clean and disinfect the entire root canal system, primarily due to the complexity and uniqueness of each root canal and the inability of current endodontic technologies to reach the microscopic spaces within the tooth. For example, studies have shown that instrumentation alone does not successfully remove all bacteria and infected tissue, with endodontic files generally only able to reach between 35% and 65% of the surfaces within the root canal. In addition, studies have demonstrated that approximately 74% of all root canal procedures show signs of residual tissue and bacteria post-procedure, most often occurring in regions of the root canal with complex anatomic features. | Superior cleaning and disinfection. Utilizing our proprietary mechanism of action that combines fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics, the GentleWave System debrides and disinfects deep regions of the complex root canal system in a less invasive procedure that preserves tooth structure. Our innovative mechanism of action enables more consistent and complete cleaning and disinfection of the root canal system in a manner that is independent of its complexity and anatomy. In multiple published studies, the GentleWave System was observed to clean significantly more debris as well as more complex anatomies compared to conventional methods of RCT.
Extensive use of instrumentation. Conventional methods of performing RCT rely on extensive use of instrumentation to remove infected tissue and enlarge root canals in preparation for irrigation, which may weaken the tooth and impact its long-term survival. Use of instrumentation within the root canal system during conventional RCT is also frequently associated with several risk factors and may increase the likelihood of | Less invasive procedure. Our technology is designed to clean and disinfect multiple root canals within the root canal system simultaneously, without requiring insertion of our PI into each root canal, thereby reducing the need for instrumentation and removal of healthy tooth structure. We believe this helps clinicians avoid common risk factors associated with the excessive use of files, such as extrusion, perforation or thinning of the root canal walls 


procedural errors that can result in fracture and therefore loss of the tooth. For example, endodontic files may cause bacteria and debris to extrude into the periapical region around the apex of the root, causing post-operative pain and preventing the tooth from properly healing. Endodontic files may also perforate the wall of the root canal, at which point tooth extraction is required. Pieces of endodontic files can break off into the canal, which may cause additional inflammation and post-operative pain, and generally requires retreatment to remove the instrument fragments from the root canal. | which may result in fracture and therefore loss of the tooth. For example, once the tooth is accessed using traditional access methods, the clinician will generally rely on the GentleWave System’s mechanism of action to debride and disinfect the root canal system. Based on our commercial experience, we have observed that clinicians using the GentleWave System require fewer and smaller files, and in some cases no files, instead of using many files to manually scrape and remove tooth structure and enlarge canals. In addition, in a published study, the GentleWave System was observed to completely clean the root canal system of debris and tissue without any instrumentation while leaving the original tooth structure intact. 
Poor clinical outcomes. The limitations of conventional methods of RCT may lead to poor clinical outcomes, such as treatment failure and post-operative pain. Published studies have shown that 28% to 74% of endodontic lesions can remain unhealed at 12 months after treatment with conventional methods of RCT. These methods are also commonly associated with more frequent and more severe post-operative pain as compared to other dental procedures. According to published studies, between 29% and 70% of patients undergoing conventional RCT report post-operative pain and the estimated weighted average success rate of conventional methods of RCT at 12+ months after treatment ranges between 68% and 85%. | High and rapid rates of healing. In our PURE study, 97% of patients treated using the GentleWave Procedure were healed or healing at the six-month follow-up, which was sustained through the 12-month follow-up. We believe our high and rapid healing rate is the result of the GentleWave System’s novel mechanism of action that enables cleaning and disinfection of microscopic spaces within root canals.Minimal to no post-operative pain. In our PURE study, patients treated using the GentleWave Procedure experienced minimal to no post-operative pain. We believe this is due to the ability of our technology to remove and clean diseased tissue and bacteria from within even the smallest spaces in the root canal system. In addition, the risk of extrusion of debris, tissue and bacteria beyond the apex of the root is minimized by dramatically reduced or no use of files as well as the negative pressure of the GentleWave System. These results are supported by our commercial experience and clinician feedback, where patients are reporting less post-operative pain and are requiring fewer prescriptions for pain-relieving medications such as opioids.
Clinical Workflow: | 
Lack of standardized procedure protocols. Given the uniqueness and complexity of the root canal system, there is generally a lack of standardized protocols for critical steps of conventional RCT. For example, the chemical concentrations, techniques and devices utilized during irrigation can vary widely between clinicians. The concentration of the most important chemical used during irrigation – sodium hypochlorite – also varies between 3% and 8%, depending on the brand, season and method of storage. Clinicians typically select, manually mix and inject this and other chemicals during the procedure, which requires time and caution in administration and can result in inconsistent concentrations across procedures. Additionally, the amount of instrumentation, including the depth to which the root canal is instrumented, is determined on a case-by-case basis by each individual dental practitioner, and can vary significantly based on | Standardized protocol that enables procedure efficiency and predictable outcomes. The GentleWave System is designed to provide a consistent, automated and standardized cleaning and disinfection protocol, regardless of anatomy or complexity. Key parameters, such as the sequence and duration of delivery of each solution are controlled by the software. For example, the system measures and adjusts procedure fluids, including distilled water, sodium hypochlorite and EDTA, for clinicians, thereby standardizing the concentration and mixing of procedure fluids across every procedure and delivering these fluids through the PI to a sealed root canal system. We believe the standardization of this procedure enables clinicians to have a more predictable procedure time and outcome and reduces the number of personnel required for the procedure, freeing up time and improving efficiency. 


the complexity of the procedure. We believe this lack of standardization contributes to unpredictable procedure times and outcomes. | 
Complex procedure. RCT using conventional methods can be difficult to perform due to the complexity and uniqueness of each root canal system, which can lead to outcomes that are dependent on the experience of the clinician and drive large disparities in patient outcomes. For example, one of the challenges in conventional RCT is to locate all root canals within the tooth. This process is considered to be a crucial part of the procedure and is entirely technique-dependent. Peer-reviewed literature indicates that approximately 12% of root canal procedures miss at least one root canal, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of treatment failure by over six times. General dentists also may elect not to perform some or all root canal procedures due to their complexity, instead referring those patients to endodontists for treatment. In addition, conventional methods of RCT utilize techniques and devices that create aerosols during the procedure, which became a concern for some clinicians and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the with the potential cross-contamination associated with aerosols. | Simple-to-use technology. We designed our technology to enable ease of use due to its standardized treatment protocol and intuitive touch screen interface. In our commercial experience, clinicians are generally able to independently perform procedures following a few days of training.Low risk of cross-contamination. The console and PI together form a closed-loop fluid management system, whereby fluids are delivered via the PI and then collected and evacuated into the waste canister inside the console. The procedure is designed to generate virtually no aerosols, which is not only convenient, but may appeal to clinicians and patients concerned with the potential cross-contamination associated with aerosols, which became a particularly sensitive issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, our PIs are pre-packaged, sterilized and single-use, which further reduces the risk of cross contamination.
Need for multiple visits. In many cases, conventional methods of performing RCT require multiple visits, depending on a variety of factors such as the clinician’s experience and preference, severity of the disease and anatomy of the root canal system being treated. Peer-reviewed data shows that approximately half of root canal procedures are completed in a single patient visit, with more complex cases typically requiring multiple visits. The need for multiple visits may be inconvenient for patients and may result in more non-billable visits for the practice, as payment is typically the same regardless of the number of visits. | More procedures completed in a single patient visit. Our GentleWave System empowers clinicians to perform even the most challenging RCT procedures in a single patient visit. This was demonstrated by our PURE study, where 92% of GentleWave Procedures were completed in a single-visit procedure. These results were further supported by our survey of GentleWave users, which showed the number of RCT procedures completed in a single patient visit increased from 57% to 90% following the clinician's adoption of the GentleWave System. We believe the GentleWave System enhances practice efficiency for clinicians by reducing non-billable patient visits and is also more convenient for patients. 
 | Practice differentiating technology with the ability to establish stronger referral relationships with general dentists and attract patients. Based on our commercial experience, we believe clinicians who use and promote our GentleWave System benefit from stronger referral relationships with other general dentists resulting in more profitable practices and differentiation relative to peers who do not use our system.

 Components of the GentleWave System and Mechanism of Action
 The key components of our GentleWave System are a sophisticated and mobile console and a sterilized single-use PI. We also offer ancillary products such as SoundSeal and our company-branded EDTA. The console is a one-time capital equipment purchase, while the PIs and ancillary products are recurring consumable purchases based on the number of procedures performed and clinician need.
 GentleWave Consoles
 Our consoles, including the GentleWave G4, are designed to prepare and deliver procedure fluids into the PI via a high-pressure hose. The consoles include fluid containers, electronics, software, corrosion-resistant tubes, a high-pressure pump, sensors, valves and a waste canister. The consoles are controlled by advanced software and operated via an intuitive touchscreen interface that simplifies procedure setup and treatment delivery. The consoles also collect the waste fluids delivered from the PI via a low-pressure evacuation tube. The consoles feature an integrated RFID reader, which reads the RFID tag inside the PI and verifies that the correct PI is being used while also preventing re-use. The consoles are enabled with wireless connectivity capabilities that allow for automatic software updates, remote monitoring of the system to ensure reliability and real-time tracking of system utilization.
 GentleWave Procedure Instruments
 The PI is a pre-packaged, sterilized, single-use instrument connected to the console via a high-pressure hose that delivers optimized fluids from the console to the end of the PI.
 In April 2022, we announced the launch of the CleanFlow PI, which has received 510(k) clearance by the FDA and has been approved by Health Canada. The CleanFlow PI utilizes the same mechanism of action as our existing PIs, but has been improved so that no components of the PI enter the tooth, regardless of tooth type. We believe the CleanFlow PI will transform the way root canal procedures are performed by cleaning the inside of the tooth from outside the tooth through the endodontic access opening, and will further simplify the GentleWave Procedure, expand our indications for use, improve user experience and enable clinicians to preserve even more tooth structure. We are actively transitioning our clinicians to CleanFlow from our legacy PIs for molar teeth (a "Molar PI") and premolars. In 2023, we expect to expand CleanFlow’s FDA clearance to include anterior teeth and replace the legacy PI designated for anteriors and premolars (an "APM PI").

The image below depicts our Molar PI and CleanFlow PI and their respective mechanisms of action:
 
GentleWave System Mechanism of Action
 The GentleWave System mechanism of action is designed to clean and disinfect the entire root canal system simultaneously and remotely, or without requiring insertion of our PI into each root canal. The key components of the GentleWave System utilize a proprietary mechanism of action that combines procedure fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics to efficiently dissolve tissue and bacteria using minimal or no instrumentation.
 The console enables a multi-stage process of optimizing procedure fluids, which include distilled water, sodium hypochlorite and EDTA, before they are delivered to the PI. Initially, the console extracts fluids from built-in containers and passes them through degassers, or components designed to reduce the fluid’s dissolved air content. In the absence of the console’s proprietary degassing process, air bubbles in the procedure fluids may act as barriers that inhibit the delivery of fluids and broad-spectrum acoustic energy throughout the root canal system. After degassing, the concentration of each procedure fluid is measured and adjusted precisely in preparation for delivery to the root canal system, thereby standardizing the concentration of procedure fluids, including sodium hypochlorite, across every procedure. The console detects and notifies the user if an incorrect or chemically degraded solution is being used, and also continuously refreshes procedure fluids during treatment.
 The PI enables a process by which broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics are created within the root canal system. Once optimized and pressurized, procedure fluids are delivered from the console to the PI via a high-pressure hose. In the distal end of the PI, a proprietary orifice converts the procedure fluids into a high-speed fluid jet. This fluid jet interacts with surrounding fluids within the procedure instrument and creates a strong shear force, which causes continuous hydrodynamic cavitation in the form of a cavitation cloud containing thousands of cavitation bubbles. The continuous formation and implosion of cavitation bubbles generates shock waves and broad-spectrum acoustic energy that propagate throughout the root canal system. The hydrodynamic cavitation that is created generates a broad range of frequencies that enables the optimal delivery of acoustic energy into structures of various dimensions inside the root canal system. The PI is also designed to generate a flow over the orifices of the root canal, which induces a vortical flow and negative pressure inside the root canals. The vortical flow is optimized to rapidly dissolve and remove tissue, bacteria and debris from the root canal system, while the negative pressure minimizes the possibility of extrusion of the procedure fluids beyond the apex of the root.
 The GentleWave Procedure
 We designed the GentleWave Procedure to be simple to learn, requiring only general dental skills to perform, and easy to integrate into a practice’s existing workflow. Certain steps of the GentleWave Procedure, including access and obturation and tooth restoration, are generally the same as conventional RCT. However, the GentleWave

Procedure transforms cleaning and disinfection, the most important aspect of RCT, by replacing the cumbersome, ineffective and invasive step of shaping and irrigation with the following simpler, more effective and less-invasive steps:
 

 | Ensuring an unobstructed path within the root canal: Once the tooth is accessed using traditional access methods, the clinician may use endodontic files to ensure there is an open fluid path to the apex and to facilitate obturation later in the procedure. Based on our commercial experience, we are seeing clinicians move towards using only one file, and in some cases no files, for this step of the procedure, instead of using many files to scrape and remove tooth structure and enlarge canals. 
 | Standardizing and automating cleaning and disinfection: Once a fluid pathway is established, a material, such as our SoundSeal product, is used to create a platform on top of the crown, which facilitates an airtight seal between the PI and the tooth. Once the PI is positioned on the tooth and a sealed environment is confirmed, the clinician uses the intuitive touchscreen interface on the GentleWave Console to select from a predefined set of treatment protocols. The foot pedal attached to the GentleWave Console is depressed to activate the GentleWave System, creating a closed loop fluid management system that seamlessly transitions between stages of the procedure, requiring minimal intervention from the clinician during treatment.

 Peer-Reviewed Research and Clinical Studies
 We are committed to continuing to generate evidence to support the clinical benefits of the GentleWave System. These benefits have been observed in-vivo and in-vitro across two prospective, multi-center clinical studies, over 30 peer-reviewed journal publications and by real-world, clinical practice, with over one million patients treated using the GentleWave System as of December 31, 2022. Our robust base of research and clinical data supports our belief that the GentleWave System has delivered strong clinical outcomes, including high and rapid healing rates with minimal to no post-operative pain, and provided superior cleaning of the entire root canal system in a less invasive procedure. In addition, the GentleWave System has been observed to drive procedure efficiency, enabling a greater proportion of root canal procedures to be completed in a single patient visit and reducing the need for endodontic files. Other than the SUPREME study referred to below, we do not believe any studies were powered for statistical significance, which we believe is common in the field of endodontic and dental research.
 Strong Clinical Outcomes
 We have conducted two prospective, multi-center clinical studies to date, in which we have observed strong clinical outcomes and benefits for patients treated with the GentleWave System. For these studies, the primary effectiveness endpoint was treatment success, defined as teeth that were considered to be healed or healing. Healing was assessed using a composite endpoint that included both clinical and radiographic components. Post-operative pain was also assessed as a secondary endpoint using a visual analog scale, where each patient ranked their level of pain from zero to ten, with ten being the highest level of pain.
Healing Rates after Endodontic Treatment Using the GentleWave System
 In 2013, we conducted a prospective, multi-center, non-significant risk clinical study to assess the long-term performance of the GentleWave System (the "PURE study"), which evaluated healing rates for molars 12 months after root canal treatment. The study also included data evaluating healing rates at six months after treatment. Six-month results were published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Dentistry in 2016 and 12-month results were published in the Journal of Endodontics in 2016.
 The study cohort was composed of 89 patients in need of endodontic therapy who were consented and received treatment via a GentleWave System from one of six private endodontic clinics in Southern California. The six endodontists that participated as investigators were trained to use the GentleWave System and performed a standardized treatment procedure at each respective clinical site. Additionally, 92.1% of the enrolled patients were treated in a single patient visit. Pre-operative, intra-operative and post-operative data were collected from the patients and assessed by two trained, blinded and independent evaluators. Seventy-seven patients, or 86.5%, returned for the six-month follow-up and 75 patients, or 84.2%, returned for the 12-month follow-up.


At the six-month follow-up, the cumulative success rate was 97.4%, with 77.9% classified as healed and 19.5% as healing. At the 12-month follow-up, the cumulative success rate was 97.3%, with 92.0% classified as healed and 5.3% as healing. The observed high, rapid and sustained healing rates in this study imply efficient cleaning of tissue debris, bacteria and biofilm from the root canal system in a single-visit procedure using the GentleWave System.
 In addition to the high rate of healing, patients reported minimal to no post-operative pain. At two days after treatment, zero patients experienced severe post-operative pain and 3.8% experienced moderate post-operative pain. Zero patients reported any incidence of pain after 14 days following treatment.
 Healing Rates of Periapical Lesions after Endodontic Treatment Using the GentleWave System
 A study was published in the Journal of Endodontics in 2018 that included data from the PURE study and another prospective, multi-center study conducted in 2015 comparing healing after treatment with the GentleWave System as compared to a traditional root canal therapy literature control (the "SUPREME study"). The published study evaluated healing rates for molars with significant periapical lesions 12 months after root canal treatment using the GentleWave System.
 The study cohort was composed of 45 patients from the PURE and SUPREME studies with periapical lesions in need of endodontic therapy who were consented and received treatment via a GentleWave System from one of four private endodontic clinics in Southern California. The four endodontists that participated as investigators were trained to use the GentleWave System and performed a standardized treatment procedure at each respective clinical site. Additionally, 88.9% of the enrolled patients were treated in a single-visit procedure. Data were collected from the patients and assessed by two trained, blinded and independent evaluators. Forty-four patients, or 97.8%, returned for the 12-month follow-up.
 At the 12-month follow-up, the cumulative success rate was 97.7%, with 81.8% classified as healed and 15.9% as healing. Further, all teeth that were treated successfully were considered completely functional and had resolution for measured indices of mobility, soft tissue lesions, sinus tract and furcation involvement. The exhibited healing rate in this study implies that the GentleWave System treats root canal infections, causing inflammation in or around the root canal system to abate, ultimately allowing periapical lesions to heal.
 In addition to the high rates of healing, patients reported minimal to no post-operative pain. At two days after treatment, zero patients experienced moderate or severe post-operative pain, and 15.6% reported mild pain. No patients reported post-operative pain at the six- and 12-month follow-up visits.
 Superior Cleaning in a Less Invasive Procedure
 Numerous in-vitro studies have been conducted that validate the novel mechanism of action of our GentleWave System. In these studies the GentleWave System successfully cleaned the root canal system, including complex anatomies, in a procedure that is less invasive than conventional methods.
Cleaning of Complex and Small Root Canal Anatomies Superior to Conventional Methods
 A study supported by us and published in the Dentistry Journal in 2016 compared the penetration depth of treatment fluids using the GentleWave System with devices commonly used in conventional methods. Specifically, the conventional methods in the study used passive ultrasonic activation with a PiezonMaster 700 (EMS) with an ESI-tip and active ultrasonic activation using a PiezonMaster 700 with an ESI-tip with maximum irrigation rate. The in-vitro study included 40 extracted human molars. The GentleWave System achieved statistical significance in

cleaning deeper into the dentinal tubules in the apical, middle and coronal regions, with treatment fluids cleaning dentinal tubules in the apical region between 4 and 8.5 times deeper than the other devices.
 


Debridement of GentleWave Compared to Conventional Methods
 A study published in the Journal of Endodontics in 2015 compared the debridement efficacy of the GentleWave System with a conventional method for cleaning root canals. This study was funded by us and our employees were involved in the design of the study. Study data was acquired and analyzed independently of us. The conventional method in the study used a 30G Max-i-Probe side-vented irrigation needle and NiTi rotary instruments (endodontic files). The in-vitro study included 45 freshly extracted molars. The GentleWave System showed a statistically significant greater cleaning capacity and reduction in residual debris compared to teeth that were cleaned conventionally. Conventional instrumentation and irrigation cleaned debris from 67.8% and 87.3% of the apical and middle regions of the root canal, respectively. The GentleWave System cleaned substantially more debris, removing 97.2% and 98.1% of the debris from the apical and middle regions, respectively. The GentleWave System also

demonstrated more complete cleaning in complex anatomies. In teeth with isthmi, 98.3% of isthmi areas were free of tissue debris after the GentleWave Procedure, compared to 64.3% of isthmi areas after conventional methods.
 

Removal of Biofilm and Bacteria Superior to Conventional Methods
 A study funded by us and published in Materials in 2019 compared disinfection and biofilm removal efficacy using the GentleWave System with minimal instrumentation with a device commonly used in conventional methods with conventional instrumentation. The device used in conventional methods used passive ultrasonic activation with a PiezonMaster 700 with an ESI-tip together with conventional rotary instrumentation (endodontic files). The in-vitro study included 47 freshly extracted human molars. The GentleWave System showed an ability to remove biofilm and bacteria in complex anatomies, demonstrated by statistically significant greater biofilm removal in the apical and isthmus regions of the root canal compared with conventional methods. Independent evaluators assessed and scored treated teeth on a scale from zero to three, with zero representing no bacteria and three representing large colonies of bacteria with greater than 50% of the wall covered in biofilm. In the middle and isthmus regions of the root canal, teeth treated with the GentleWave System all received scores of zero while teeth treated conventionally received scores of two and three. In the apical region of the root canal, teeth treated with the GentleWave System received scores ranging from zero to one while teeth treated conventionally received scores ranging from two to three.
Ability to Preserve More of the Original Tooth Structure without Instrumentation
 A study funded by us and published in the Journal of Endodontics in 2018 examined root canal wall anatomy in uninstrumented premolar teeth cleaned using the GentleWave System. The in vitro study included 24 freshly extracted human premolars. The GentleWave System fully cleaned the root canal system of organic material without any instrumentation while leaving the original tooth structure intact. No organic tissue remnants or dentin debris were detected following treatment.
Enhanced Procedure Efficiency
 The GentleWave System has been shown to improve procedure efficiency by enabling clinicians to perform RCT in a single patient visit while reducing the need for instrumentation. In 2020, we conducted a survey of 35 clinicians that focused on quantifying the practice benefits provided by our GentleWave System. The survey compared the percentage of single-visit RCT procedures and endodontic file costs before and after adoption of the GentleWave System. The results of the survey showed an increase in the number of single-visit RCT procedures from 57% to 90% of total RCT procedures following GentleWave System adoption. This increase in the proportion of single-visit RCT procedures enabled by the GentleWave System was observed across cases of varying complexity. These survey results are supported by data from our peer-reviewed, prospective clinical studies as well as commercial

experience. Our survey also demonstrated a reduction in the need for instrumentation, with users reporting an average reduction in endodontic file costs of 41% after adopting the GentleWave System. The results of this survey may not be representative of the entire dental population and are based on informal feedback we received in performing the survey.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our commercial strategy and sales model focuses on facilitating adoption of our GentleWave System by increasing our installed base of consoles and maximizing procedural instrument revenue through increased utilization of our GentleWave Systems. As of December 31, 2022, our sales and marketing team consisted of approximately 85 employees working collaboratively across a range of clinician facing roles to support an installed base of approximately 976 GentleWave Systems. We have structured our sales and clinician support team with specialized roles, including 25 capital sales representatives, 16 consumable sales representatives, five clinical training specialists, nine field service engineers and 20 marketing team members.
Sales
 Our capital sales representatives are responsible for generating demand for consoles both from new clinicians and broadening adoption among clinicians that already use our products. Our sales and marketing teams identify key opportunities that enable capital sales representatives to drive expansion of console placements across markets. Following the sale of a console, capital sales representatives participate in the onboarding process with the clinical training specialist and consumable sales representatives.
 Our clinical training specialists are dedicated to clinician training and continuing education, often within larger group practices, and universities. Our clinical training specialists lead comprehensive onsite training programs, which generally allow clinicians to perform procedures independently following a few days of training. They play an important role in supporting our sales organization to enable increased confidence and utilization.
 Our consumable sales representatives are focused on building relationships with clinician and dental practitioners, driving higher utilization and increasing PI revenue within the practice. Our consumable sales representatives will train and onboard new accounts and provide continuing education and practice support for existing accounts. Our consumable sales representatives partner with clinicians to enhance practice efficiency and clinical workflow and increase patient volumes.
 Our field service engineers, augmented by a third-party service partner, work closely with our sales team to ensure high uptime for the GentleWave Systems and a positive user experience by performing preventive maintenance and responding to on-site device needs. Field service engineers operate efficiently to ensure our console installed base remains well-maintained and capable of high utilization levels. The GentleWave System has continuous monitoring capabilities that we can use to remotely diagnose and proactively identify needed maintenance to maximize the efficiency of our targeted site visits.
 The GentleWave System is currently authorized for sale within the United States and Canada. We plan to pursue regulatory clearances, certifications and other market access initiatives over time in attractive international regions in which we see significant potential opportunity. For these select international regions, we intend to explore the commercial opportunity either through distributors or direct sales.
 Marketing
 Our marketing team is focused on expanding awareness of the GentleWave System and its benefits among prospective patients and the broader dental practitioner community. Our professional marketing and educational initiatives include publications and podium presentations at industry conferences and scientific forums, organizing peer-to-peer dialogue and events to educate clinicians on the benefits of the GentleWave System and leveraging our strong network of supportive key opinion leaders. Moving forward, we will work to draw more attention to the GentleWave Procedure in select markets where we have established a large installed base by communicating the benefits of our system through targeted direct-to-patient marketing activities including social, digital and search optimization.


We partner with clinicians through various practice support programs, which focus on increasing awareness and strengthening referral relationships with general dentists. For example, through our GentleWave Practice Success (“GPS”) Program, we provide guidance to our partner practices on comprehensive staff training, expansive Sonendo-sponsored marketing initiatives and engaging self-marketing strategies. We also provide content for digital marketing and social media postings to educate patients on the GentleWave Procedure and increase new business for practices. We believe our marketing programs help differentiate the GentleWave System and are valuable in helping clinicians further grow their practices.
 Research and Development
 We are committed to developing innovations that transform dentistry, with a focus on saving teeth. We have strong research and development capabilities in the treatment of tooth decay using fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics as well as integrating hardware and software to create an exceptional user and patient experience. A core part of our research and development strategy is engagement with our network of clinicians, which enables us to leverage real-world feedback to deliver meaningful innovation to clinicians. We believe our strategy will allow us to continue to develop new functionalities and upgrades to our GentleWave System, enable us to innovate, enhance our competitive position and expand our addressable market.
 As we continue to transform RCT, our research and development efforts are focused on innovating our technologies to improve the usability of the GentleWave System and enhancing the efficiency and predictability of the GentleWave Procedure. We are also exploring development of next-generation technologies that expand the application of our GentleWave System beyond RCT for use in treating cavities in earlier-stage tooth decay.
 Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We currently manufacture, assemble, test and ship our GentleWave System, which includes our console and single-use PI, at our approximately 55,000 square foot facility in Laguna Hills, California. This facility provides approximately 10,000 square feet of space for our production operations, including receiving, manufacturing, quality control, inventory and shipping.
 We use a combination of internally manufactured and externally-sourced components to produce our GentleWave System. Externally-sourced components include off-the-shelf materials, sub-assemblies and custom parts that are provided by approved suppliers. Our GentleWave Console includes a number of components, including high pressure lines, high pressure pumps, fluid temperature control systems, degassing components and user interface control systems, most of which we source externally from third party suppliers. For certain of these components, there are relatively few alternative sources of supply. We seek to manage single-source supplier risk by regularly assessing the quality and capacity of our suppliers and actively managing lead times and inventory levels of sourced components. In addition, particularly as we expand our business and sales, we are continuously reviewing sources and approving alternative suppliers to dual or multi-source certain of our components. We generally seek to maintain sufficient supply levels to help mitigate any supply interruptions and enable us to find and qualify another source of supply. Finished single-use PIs are sterilized at one of two qualified suppliers. The manufacture of our ancillary products, including our branded EDTA solution and SoundSeal Material, is outsourced to a contract manufacturer. For a discussion of associated risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors – "We depend upon third-party suppliers, including contract manufacturers and single and sole source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations."
 We are undertaking continuous margin improvement programs, including implementing lean manufacturing methods and collaborating with our suppliers to reduce material costs, and have executed several product design improvements to reduce product cost. We are also currently working to optimize several parts of our manufacturing process as well as consolidate the manufacture of several of the components for our console and single-use PI to fewer third-party suppliers.
 Competition
 Our proprietary technology platform represents an innovative approach to the treatment of tooth decay. As a result, our treatment method competes directly against conventional methods of treating root canals. We compete with

manufacturers and suppliers of devices, instruments and other supplies used in connection with such conventional treatments. The market for these devices and instruments is highly fragmented with primary supply chains concentrated across a few larger manufacturers and distributors, such as Dentsply Sirona, Envista and Henry Schein. Many of our competitors have longer, more established operating histories, and significantly greater name recognition and financial, technical, marketing, sales, distribution and other resources.
 We believe the primary competitive factors for companies that market new or alternative treatments and solutions in dental applications include acceptance by leading clinicians, patient outcomes and adverse event rates, patient experience and treatment time, ease-of-use and reliability, patient recovery time and level of discomfort, economic benefits and cost savings, intellectual property protection and the development of successful sales and marketing channels. One of the major hurdles to widespread adoption of our solutions will be overcoming established treatment patterns, which will require education of patients, clinicians and their referral sources.
 In addition, we may compete with additional competitors and products outside the United States and Canada when we pursue plans to market our products internationally. Among other competitive advantages, such companies may have more established sales and marketing programs and networks, established relationships with clinicians and greater name recognition in such markets.
 We believe our ability to compete effectively will depend on our ability to build the commercial infrastructure necessary to demonstrate the value of the GentleWave Procedure, maintain and improve product quality and feature functionality, build the infrastructure to support the operating needs of the business and achieve cost reductions.
 Intellectual Property
 We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and protective contractual provisions with our employees, contractors, consultants, suppliers, partners and other third parties, to protect our intellectual property rights.
 We have more than 200 active patents worldwide and have many patent applications in process. We continually seek additional U.S. and international patents on our technology. Our pending patent and trademark applications may not result in issued patents or registered trademarks, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents or registered trademarks will protect our intellectual property rights, provide us with any competitive advantage or withstand or retain its original scope after a validity or enforceability challenge from a third party.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 32 U.S. patents, which are expected to expire between February 9, 2027 and April 18, 2038, and there were 30 pending U.S. patent applications. As of December 31, 2022, we had 103 total issued foreign patents with anticipated expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2035, 51 total pending foreign patent applications, and two pending Patent Cooperation Treaty applications.
 As of December 31, 2022, our patent portfolio included 16 U.S. patents, 12 pending U.S. patent applications, 66 foreign patents, 21 pending foreign patent applications, and one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application that relate to our GentleWave Console and PIs. These patents and patent applications belong to patent families relating to the following technology areas:
 •Three utility-type patent families directed to procedure instruments with pressure wave generators and to the use of such instruments for dental procedures, the patents and patent applications (if issued) in these three patent families have anticipated expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2031;
 •Five utility-type patent families directed to pressure waves and irrigational flow for dental procedures, the patents in these four patent families have anticipated expiration dates ranging from 2033 to 2035, and the patent applications in these four patent families—if issued—would have anticipated expiration dates ranging from 2033 to 2041;
 •Four design-type patent families directed to designs for a procedure instrument and console, the patents and patent applications (if issued) in these three patent families have anticipated expiration dates ranging from 2029 to at least 2038; and


•One utility-type patent family directed to other aspects of our GentleWave products, including console features such as security, authentication, and fluid management, the patents and patent applications (if issued) in this patent family have anticipated expiration dates in 2034.
 The term of any individual patent depends on the relevant laws and regulations in the country in which it is granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term for a utility patent is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a nonprovisional patent application in the applicable country.
 As of December 31, 2022, we owned 120 registered trademarks and 43 pending trademark applications worldwide, including trademark registrations for “Sonendo” and “GentleWave” in the United States and other countries.
 Our pending patent and trademark applications may not result in issued patents or registered trademarks, and we cannot assure you that any current or subsequently issued patents or registered trademarks will protect our intellectual property rights, provide us with any competitive advantage or withstand or retain its original scope after a validity or enforceability challenge from a third party. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop competitive products that are not covered by our intellectual property, and we may be unable to stop such competitor from commercializing such products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or technologies may be alleged to infringe. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. We may, from time to time, be forced to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, protect our trade secrets or know-how, defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages and/or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay significant royalties to such third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using our product or techniques, any of which could severely harm our business.
 We are committed to protecting our intellectual property and any future application of our intellectual property and investments in innovation. For example, in January 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary, PIPStek LLC, filed a patent infringement lawsuit against BIOLASE, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. In the lawsuit, PIPStek asserts infringement of two of its U.S. patents by BIOLASE's Waterlase laser.
 Our knowledge and experience, creative product development, marketing staff and trade secret information, with respect to manufacturing processes and product design, are important in maintaining our proprietary product lines. As a condition of employment, we require all employees and key contractors to execute an agreement obligating them to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information and assign to us inventions and other intellectual property created during their employment. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information regarding these and other risks related to our intellectual property portfolio and their potential effect on us.
Government Regulation
Our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. For example, our GentleWave device is subject to regulation as a medical device in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"), as implemented and enforced by the FDA.
United States Regulation
 The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements


Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a premarket notification submitted under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, or approval of a premarket approval application ("PMA"). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising for certain devices, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidance documents.
 While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
Our currently marketed GentleWave System, which includes our GentleWave Console and PIs, is a Class II device and has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA.
 510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway
 Our current products are subject to requirements for pre-market notification and clearance under section 510(k) of the FDCA. To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval (i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process, or a 501(k)-exempt device). The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until such marketing authorization has been granted. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
 Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the 510(k) pathway. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the

use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, although the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.
 More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.
 Post-market Regulation
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
 •establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
 •QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
 •labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of uses of cleared or approved products;
 •requirements related to promotional activities;
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a new or different intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;
 •medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
 •correction, removal, and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
 •the FDA’s authority to hold, detail, or refuse imported shipments of FDA-regulated products, including medical devices and their components;
 •the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
 •post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
 Manufacturing processes for medical devices and accessories are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation, and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled and unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations, adverse inspection or audit reports such as Form 483 Notices of Inspectional Observations, recall, market withdrawal, or seizure of marketed products, or other enforcement actions

by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or approval, or by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. On February 23, 2022, the FDA proposed to amend the QSR requirements to align more closely with the international consensus standards for medical devices, the FDA proposed to incorporate by reference the 2016 edition of the ISO 13485 standard, and also proposed to withdraw the current requirements in 21 C.F.R. part 820. We do not have certainty on when or if the proposed rule will be finalized or even if it is finalized, whether it will be finalized in its current proposed form. While ISO 13485 and the FDA’s QSR requirements are similar in certain aspects, it is possible that we may need to revise our compliance system and processes to be in line with the ISO 13485 requirements, and any revisions that the FDA may make to the requirements.
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers and manufacturers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer or supplier has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following, among others:
 •warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
 •recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
 •operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 •refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
 •placement of our products or their components on the FDA's Import Alert;
 •withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
 •refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or
 •criminal prosecution.
 Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union
 In the European Union, ("EU"), until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the Council Directive 93/42/EEC, or the EU Medical Devices Directive, which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the "EU Medical Devices Regulation"). Unlike directives, regulations are directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law.
 All medical devices placed on the EU market must meet general safety and performance requirements of the EU Medical Devices Regulation, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and – where applicable – other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art.
 Compliance with the general safety and performance requirements is a prerequisite for European Conformity Marking ("CE-Mark"), without which medical devices cannot be marketed or sold in the EU. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility, metrology or reuse aspects), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturer's quality system. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and

performance requirements, the notified body issues a CE marking certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE Mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU.
 Throughout the term of the CE Mark, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant CE marking certificate(s) or in case of substantial changes to the device or quality system.
 All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (the "FSCAs") must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area ("EEA"), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Regulation of Medical Devices in Canada
 Canada regulates the import and sale of medical devices through Health Canada ("HC"). HC classifies medical devices into four classifications, with Class I being the lowest risk and Class IV being the highest. Class I and II devices are often cleared for sale after they are CE marked or listed on the company’s ISO certification and filed via fax-back applications for a Medical Device License. Higher classification risk devices (Class III and IV) require filing dossiers that resemble U.S. 510(k) applications. These applications can range in cost and typically take longer for approval. Our Canadian medical device license (#101958) was issued in 2018 and, as a holder of such a license, we are subject to inspection by HC and must maintain a valid Medical Device Single Audit Program ("MDSAP") certificate. We were issued a MDSAP certificate by DQS Medizinprodukte GmbH in June 2020 and it remains valid through June 2023. We plan to renew the certificate before it expires.
U.S. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
 In the United States, we are subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict certain business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, transparency laws governing payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers, and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. Failure to meet the requirements of the safe harbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances, including the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse, and may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
 The Federal False Claims Act (the "FCA") prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or from making a false statement or using a false record to have a claim approved. The federal FCA further provides that a lawsuit thereunder may be initiated in the name of the United States by an individual, a “whistleblower,” who is an original source of the allegations. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Penalties for a violation of the FCA include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim.
 Further, the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to

offering remuneration to a federal health care program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder (collectively "HIPAA") also established federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals, and teaching hospitals. Applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations must also report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
 Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program.
 Violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, additional reporting requirements and compliance oversight obligations, contractual damages, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and/ or imprisonment.
 U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement
 Our customers are typically reimbursed, in part, for the cost of our products by third party payors or are otherwise paid directly by patients in connection with procedures performed. In the United States, approximately 50% of adults aged 18 to 64 with private health insurance have dental care coverage. Dental practitioners bill for the procedures using the applicable Code on Dental Procedures and Nomenclature ("CDT") established by the American Dental Association. Reimbursement rates vary by payor, however, based on the procedure performed and are unrelated to the costs actually incurred by the dental practitioner in that procedure. We believe that the reimbursement rates for RCT have remained stable and generally cover dental practitioners for the cost of the GentleWave Procedure under existing billing codes. Where patients are uninsured and are not otherwise covered by a third party payor, these patients are expected to pay their respective dental practitioner out-of-pocket for their RCT.
 Further, in the United States, government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, generally provide limited to no coverage and reimbursement for dental procedures in which our products are used. Where third-party payor coverage is not available, patients are responsible for all of the costs associated with treatment using our products. As a result, our success depends in part on the ability and willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket for treatment using our products. Certain commercial payors, Medicare Advantage plans and plans purchased through the ACA marketplace do, however, provide coverage and reimbursement for the procedures in which our products are used. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among payors in the United States exists and coverage and reimbursement for procedures can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process can be a time consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. To contain costs of new technologies, third-party payors are increasingly scrutinizing new and existing treatments by requiring extensive evidence of favorable clinical outcomes. Dentists may not purchase our products if they do not receive sufficient reimbursement from payors for the cost of the product or procedures using our product. If third-party payors do not provide

coverage or adequate reimbursement levels for procedures using our products, the demand for our products will not increase and/or there may be significant pricing pressure, either of which could adversely impact our business and financial condition.
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system, many of which are intended to contain or reduce healthcare costs. By way of example, the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. President Biden has issued executive orders instructing certain governmental agencies to review their existing policies or practices to identify ways to expand the availability of affordable health coverage, to improve the quality of coverage, to strengthen benefits, and to help more Americans enroll in quality health coverage. It is unclear how these and other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA will impact post-market regulation, the ACA or our business.
 We expect additional state and federal healthcare reform measures to be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners.
 For example, HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of such covered entities. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties.
 Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.
 In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), and the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts

more challenging, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on data processing.
 Human Capital Resources and Employees
 We employ a growing and highly-skilled employee base, including our sales force, and promote a culture of innovation to continuously iterate and enhance our products, systems and commercial footprint. Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and future employees.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 261 employees (including 244 full-time employees). Employee turnover has not had a material impact on our operations. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a trade or labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our employees are our greatest asset and we seek to attract purpose-driven individuals who are devoted to our mission of saving teeth while improving lives. We have the following core values around three key focuses of Patients, Accountability and Positivity:
 •Diversity and inclusion. Our team is comprised of a diverse group of different backgrounds, orientations, beliefs, perspectives and capabilities. We are committed to a culture where diversity, respect, belonging and authenticity are valued. In our recruitment practice we have diversity outreach to various employment boards.
 •Attraction and recruitment efforts. We are committed to hiring the best talent. Our recruiting strategy involves utilization of social media, employee referral programs, as well as internal and external recruiters. 
 •Training and development. We are committed to developing our employees through on-boarding and continuous training sessions which are routinely re-administered, updated and refreshed. Employees are encouraged to participate in a variety of Company-provided learning resources and external training programs.
 •Workplace safety. The safety, health, and well-being of our employees is our first priority by maintaining high safety and health standards. In addition to complying with all Federal, State and Local ordinances, we sponsor a safety committee to routinely review our polices, practices and programs to seek opportunities to further improve our safety and health standards. 
 •COVID-19 Response. As an essential manufacturer we implemented numerous guidelines and policies to enable us to meet customer demands and at the same time provide a safe workplace for our employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. These guidelines and policies were developed based on directions from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. We have also provided support and guidance regarding the health and well-being of our employees and their family members.
 •Financial benefits and rewards. We have designed and implemented our cash and stock compensation programs to attract, motivate, and retain our employees. We regularly review our compensation structure to ensure that we remain competitive, reward top performance, and ensure internal equity, while maintaining proper fiscal governance. Our compensation packages are designed based on market benchmarks. We offer robust benefits package including health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, a retirement plan and life and disability coverage.
 •Employee engagement. We believe having employees be the best version of themselves is critical to our success, which is achieved by keeping our employees engaged through frequent and transparent communication across management levels. “Let the Best Idea Win” is our core value underlying the communication.
