ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are an integrated discovery through clinical development biopharmaceutical company, with a focus on developing therapeutics that target the dysregulated transcription that causes cancer and other serious diseases. We are enrolling patients in clinical trials for two compounds. Our product engine, which includes our proprietary small molecule microarray (SMM) screening platform, provides us with the capability to map and target transcription regulatory networks (TRNs) in a differentiated manner to enable discovery of novel compounds and improve our ability to discover and optimize clinical development candidates. In addition to our own internal preclinical programs, we have entered into a collaboration agreement with Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group (Genentech). 
 We are developing KB-0742, our internally discovered, oral cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) inhibitor, for the treatment of MYC-amplified and other transcriptionally addicted solid tumors. We have initiated the Phase 2 portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial. KB-0742 was generated from our optimization of a compound that was identified using our SMM platform.
We are also developing lanraplenib, our next generation orally-administered SYK inhibitor, and are in the dose escalation stage of our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial. This clinical trial will evaluate lanraplenib in combination with gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3- mutated AML. Lanraplenib has multiple advantages over our first-generation SYK inhibitor, entospletinib. In November 2022, we announced the decision to close enrollment of our Phase 3 clinical trial of entospletinib in combination with intensive chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed NPM-1 mutated AML for strategic reasons, and study closure is anticipated in mid-2023.
 In our research efforts, we are leveraging our product engine to drive multiple oncology discovery programs targeting dysregulated transcription factors and their associated TRNs. Some of the most powerful oncogenes in all of human cancer encode transcription factors: proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences on the genome and control how sets of genes are turned on and off. Transcription factors historically have been difficult to target in drug development because they generally lack hydrophobic pockets amenable to ligand binding to disrupt function and are typically intrinsically disordered, adopting a functional structure only when assembled with a complex of cofactors in the nucleus on the genome. Transcription factors with aberrant expression or activity result in dysregulated TRNs, which are frequently responsible for reprogramming healthy cells into cancerous tumor cells. Therapeutically modulating dysregulated transcription factors requires a sophisticated and holistic approach due to their complexity and their regulation of complex TRNs in a context-dependent manner. Based on this work, in November 2021, we announced the advancement of two programs, one focused on the MYC TRN and one focused on the androgen receptor (AR) TRN, which we are continuing to advance.
In addition, in January 2023, we entered into a research collaboration with Genentech, focused on discovering and developing small-molecule drugs that modulate transcription factor targets selected by Genentech. Under the collaboration, we will leverage our proprietary drug discovery platform, including the small molecule microarray, for hit finding, to build upon research conducted by Genentech.
We take a systems biology approach to unlocking therapeutic mechanisms within dysregulated TRNs using our differentiated product engine. Our product engine includes three interconnected components, each of which is informed by our translational expertise, and which we believe enables efficient discovery and development of new product candidates:
•Map TRNs – Leverage our computational biology expertise, engineered cell systems and high throughput transcriptomic profiling to map the structure of TRNs defined by specific dysregulated transcription factors and identify the gene expression signature of selective TRN modulation that can be carried forward into discovery and clinical translation.
•Define Dependencies – Apply causal and mechanistic insights to analyze TRNs and to identify critical nodes that may represent tractable targets for drug discovery. We do this by identifying which genetic 
sequences transcription factors bind to, which proteins they interact with, and which genes they regulate in specific cellular contexts. 
•Identify Modulators – Conduct high throughput screens using our proprietary SMM screening platform against dysregulated transcription factors in tumor cell lysates to identify selective TRN modulators and determine mechanism of action. Such modulators are then further optimized to refine their pharmacological properties.
KB-0742 
KB-0742, generated from our product engine’s SMM platform, is a highly selective, oral CDK9 inhibitor being developed to treat MYC-amplified solid tumors and other transcriptionally addicted tumors. In February 2021, we initiated the Phase 1 portion of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KB-0742 to evaluate its safety, PK and PD. In December 2022, we announced the selection of the recommended Phase 2 dose of 60 mg. While continuing to dose escalate in the Phase 1 portion of the trial, we also began enrollment of expansion cohorts at the recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule in patients with MYC-amplified solid tumors and other transcriptionally addicted cancers. We plan to present results of the trial, including the Phase 1 stage and initial data from the Phase 2 expansion stage, at a medical conference in the second half of 2023.
Lanraplenib
We are developing a next-generation SYK inhibitor, lanraplenib. In August 2022, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, which includes a dose-escalation and an expansion cohort study design. In the Phase 1b stage of this trial, we are evaluating initial safety, PK and anti-leukemic activity of escalating once-daily doses of lanraplenib in combination with the standard approved dose of gilteritinib in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients. Once a recommended dose is established and pending the data from the Phase 1b stage, we plan to initiate the Phase 2 stage of the trial, with an expansion cohort of approximately 30 patients to further evaluate the safety of lanraplenib and assess its anti-leukemic activity as measured by composite CR rate and duration of response. We anticipate sharing initial data, along with the recommended Phase 2 dose, in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024.

Our Pipeline
We have developed a robust clinical pipeline through a combination of internal discovery efforts and focused asset acquisition. The following chart summarizes the current stages of our development programs, including KB-0742 and lanraplenib, and our next anticipated milestones. 
We are also executing on robust discovery programs across multiple TRNs, which focus on four cancer types where dysregulated transcription plays a central role: hematologic malignancies, prostate cancer, MYC-driven cancers, and small cell/neuroendocrine cancers.
KB-0742: our CDK9 Inhibitor 
KB-0742 was generated from our product engine’s SMM screening platform. KB-0742 is an oral CDK9 inhibitor with a differentiated biochemical selectivity and clinical PK profile. CDK9 is a serine/threonine kinase that forms the catalytic core of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). CDK9 is a global regulator of transcription, and has been recognized as a high-value oncology drug target due to its essential role in maintaining high levels of transcription for oncogenes and short-lived anti-apoptotic proteins.
In February 2021, the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1 stage of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate KB-0742’s safety, PK and PD properties across multiple dose levels. In November 2021, we reported initial results from the first three dose levels of our ongoing dose escalation stage of our Phase 1/2 trial of KB-0742 in patients with solid tumors. In December 2022, we announced the selection of 60mg as our recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). An analysis of the trial results demonstrated that treatment with a 60mg dose of KB-0742 led to a targeted reduction in PBMCs of approximately 50% in levels of phosphorylated Ser2 on RNA Polymerase II (pSer2), a direct substrate target of CDK9. This level of target engagement is consistent with demonstrating anti-tumor activity based on preclinical models. The 60mg dose appears to have an acceptable safety profile and the maximum tolerated dose has not yet been defined. This analysis further showed that KB-0742 continued to demonstrate a differentiated PK profile, with oral bioavailability and dose-proportional exposure across all four dose levels, and low to moderate variability between patients. At the time of RP2D selection, a total of 26 patients had been enrolled and treated in the dose escalation phase of the study. Among these patients, PK data were collected and analyzed for 25 patients and KB-0742 continued to demonstrate a terminal half-life of 24 hours, with approximately 2.1 to 2.5 fold accumulation between day 1 and day 10.
While continuing to dose escalate in the Phase 1 portion of the trial, we are also actively enrolling expansion cohorts of patients with MYC-amplified solid tumors and other transcriptionally addicted tumor types at the RP2D. The subsequent development path to registration will be based on the frequency, magnitude and durability of responses observed in these expansion cohorts.
Our initial development focus for KB-0742 is for potential use in advanced transcriptionally addicted solid tumors, including tumors with MYC genomic copy number gain (amplification). MYC is a well-characterized transcription factor and a long-recognized driver of cancer that is dysregulated in a significant proportion of malignancies, including lung, breast, ovarian, and various gastrointestinal cancers, as a result of genomic amplification and other mechanisms. CDK9 is a critical node in the MYC TRN, acting both as an upstream driver of MYC expression and a downstream co-factor of MYC itself that is required to drive the MYC-dependent oncogenic gene expression program. Preclinical characterization of KB-0742 has demonstrated that MYC over-expression resulting from genomic amplification and other mechanisms is associated with increased tumor sensitivity across multiple histologies, potentially enabling a tissue of origin-agnostic development strategy.
Lanraplenib: our SYK Inhibitor
Lanraplenib is a small molecule selective inhibitor targeting SYK, a critical node in a dysregulated TRN within AML defined by persistent high expression of the transcription factors HOX/MEIS. SYK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and is an important mediator of immunoreceptor signaling in hematopoietic cells with a clearly established role in both malignant and non-malignant hematologic disease.
SYK is a critical dependency in biomarker-defined subsets of AML patients characterized by persistent high HOX/MEIS expression. Multiple AML driver mutations, including NPM1, MLL (KMT2A) gene rearrangements (MLL-r) and DNMT3A, have been associated with elevation of HOX/MEIS, which increases quantity and activity of SYK as part of an oncogenic TRN. SYK contributes to the leukemia cell state through multiple mechanisms, including direct modulation of downstream growth-promoting transcriptional programs, phosphorylation of FLT3, a known driver of leukemogenic signaling, and participation in a positive feedback loop to MEIS1 that maintains 
high MEIS1 expression. We believe these multiple oncogenic functions make SYK a compelling therapeutic target and a critical node in the HOX/MEIS TRN.
Our expertise in TRN biology allowed us to recognize SYK as a critical node in the HOX/MEIS TRN, and in July 2020, we acquired a portfolio of selective, orally bioavailable small molecule SYK inhibitors from Gilead. The acquisition included two clinical-stage product candidates:
•Lanraplenib – A next generation SYK inhibitor with improved PK and pharmacologic properties compared with entospletinib, including once daily (QD) dosing, no food restrictions and compatibility with proton pump inhibitors. Lanraplenib was previously studied in clinical trials that included more than 250 healthy volunteers and patients with autoimmune diseases, establishing an acceptable safety profile. Our preclinical evaluation of lanraplenib showed equivalent anti-leukemic activity in head-to-head comparisons with entospletinib. We dosed the first patient in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in August 2022. This clinical trial includes a dose-escalation and an expansion cohort study design. In this trial, the Phase 1b stage will evaluate initial safety, PK and anti-leukemic activity of escalating once-daily doses of lanraplenib in combination with the standard approved dose of gilteritinib in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients. Once a recommended dose is established and pending the data from the Phase 1 stage, we plan to initiate the Phase 2 stage of the trial, with an expansion cohort of approximately 30 patients to further evaluate the safety of lanraplenib and assess its anti-leukemic activity as measured by composite CR rate and duration of response. We anticipate sharing initial data, along with the recommended Phase 2 dose, in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024.
•Entospletinib – An orally administered SYK inhibitor with high selectivity, dosed twice-daily (BID). In December 2021 we initiated a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial of entospletinib using MRD-negative CR as the primary endpoint in support of potential accelerated approval. In November 2022, we announced the decision to close enrollment of the Phase 3 clinical trial for strategic reasons. The trial was not discontinued due to adverse events or lack of efficacy signals. Final study closure is anticipated in mid-2023.
Discovery Programs
We continually invest in early discovery efforts utilizing our proprietary product engine, with the goal of expanding our pipeline of future product candidates, either alone or with third party collaborators. Our current efforts are focused on four cancer types where dysregulated transcription plays a central role: hematologic malignancies, prostate cancer, MYC-driven cancers, and small cell/neuroendocrine cancers (SCNC). We are developing a deep understanding of the underlying disease biology within these cancer types, engineering robust systems to characterize transcription factor perturbation signatures, and are evaluating multiple potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention through modulation of key TRN components. We select our discovery targets based on scientific, translational and competitive considerations, prioritizing those where dependency has been demonstrated in a defined patient population with high unmet medical need, and where we believe we can design an efficient early clinical translation strategy based upon our understanding of the disease biology.
We have a discovery collaboration with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, focused on discovering and developing small-molecule drugs that modulate transcription-factor targets selected by Genentech.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company by discovering transformational small molecule modulators of historically challenging targets in cancer and other serious diseases, and then developing those product candidates through regulatory approval, and ultimately commercializing those agents, using a precision medicine approach for patient populations with high unmet medical need. We intend to do this by continuing to employ our proprietary product engine to discover and develop product candidates. The key near-term elements of our strategy include:
•Establish clinical proof of concept for KB-0742 (CDK9 program). In February 2021, the first patient was dosed in the first stage of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, designed to initially assess the safety, PK and PD profile of KB-0742 in patients with advanced solid tumors. We have announced a recommended Phase 2 dose and begun enrolling subsequent signal-seeking expansion cohorts in cancer patients with MYC-amplified solid tumors and other transcriptionally addicted cancers while continuing to dose escalate in the Phase 1 portion of the trial. We reported initial data from the dose escalation stage of the clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2021, and reported the recommended Phase 2 dose and data from the Phase 1 portion of this trial in December 2022.
•Determine RP2D for lanraplenib and pursue rational combinations in AML (SYK program). In August 2022, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial which includes a dose-escalation and an expansion cohort study design. In the Phase 1b stage of this trial, we are evaluating initial safety, PK and anti-leukemic activity of escalating once-daily doses of lanraplenib in combination with the standard approved dose of gilteritinib in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients. Once a recommended Phase 2 dose is established and pending the data from the Phase 1 stage, we plan to initiate the Phase 2 stage of the trial, with an expansion cohort of approximately 30 patients to further evaluate the safety of lanraplenib and assess its anti-leukemic activity as measured by composite CR rate and duration of response. We anticipate sharing initial data, along with the recommended Phase 2 dose, in the fourth quarter of 2023 or first quarter of 2024.
•Leverage our product engine to grow our pipeline of internally-generated product candidates. Our research efforts are directed to establishing a robust pipeline of additional highly differentiated product candidates targeting dysregulated transcription factors and their associated TRNs, leveraging our SMM platform, and our chemical biology, and computational and experimental biology capabilities.
•Selectively enter into strategic collaborations to maximize the potential of and to expand our pipeline. We plan to pursue, selectively evaluate, and, if appropriate, enter into strategic collaborations that leverage complementary capabilities of current or future collaboration partners to advance and accelerate the clinical development of our product candidates, as well as maximize our commercial reach for product candidates that receive regulatory approval. In addition, our product engine has the potential to identify differentiated product candidates addressing a wide variety of diseases with high unmet medical need and we believe that, building on our strategic collaboration with Genentech, we may have the opportunity to enter into research collaborations with potential partners to expand upon their research to date or to explore together new areas of dysregulated transcription. We also continue to evaluate potential assets and technologies from third parties and believe we have built a team well suited for the continued identification, evaluation and acquisition of additional product candidates or technologies that complement our scientific focus, core efforts and capabilities.
•Leverage our experienced management team to build a fully-integrated, science-driven biopharmaceutical company addressing high unmet medical needs. Our management team possesses significant expertise across all stages of discovery, translation, late-stage clinical development 
and commercialization. Collectively, our management team has obtained regulatory approval and has successfully commercialized over 25 therapeutic products, including several that have fundamentally transformed patient outcomes. We plan to progress our product candidates expeditiously through regulatory approval, with the vision of ultimately building a fully-integrated, science-driven biopharmaceutical company.
KB-0742: Our Investigational CDK9 Inhibitor
KB-0742 is an oral CDK9 inhibitor with a differentiated selectivity profile. CDK9 is a global regulator of transcription and a critical node in the oncogenic TRN resulting from MYC overexpression. While CDK9 is a required component of transcriptional machinery for many genes across the genome, certain tumors are “transcriptionally addicted,” meaning that they require a higher level of transcription than normal cells in order to survive. 
KB-0742 was internally optimized from an SMM hit and we believe it possesses differentiated selectivity for CDK9 among other attractive pharmacologic properties. While several other compounds targeting CDK9 are being clinically investigated by third parties for the treatment of cancer, their published biochemical selectivity profiles indicate the potential for cross-reactivity to cell cycle CDKs at clinical exposures. We believe this may contribute to the toxicity and limited therapeutic index observed with these agents and explain why in general they have not advanced to later-stage clinical trials. In addition, our pre-clinical models suggest that sustained partial inhibition of CDK9 is essential for anti-tumor activity while avoiding on-target toxicity. Because of its oral bioavailability and long plasma half-life, KB-0742 lends itself to achieving this target coverage profile in patients.
The FDA cleared our IND submission of KB-0742 in December 2020. In February 2021, we initiated the dose-escalation stage of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KB-0742 to evaluate its safety, PK and PD. While continuing to dose escalate, we are enrolling the expansion cohorts at the recommended Phase 2 clinical trial dose and schedule in patients with MYC-amplified solid tumors and pother transcriptionally addicted cancers. We reported initial data from the dose escalation stage of the clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2021 and reported the recommended Phase 2 dose and initial data from the Phase 1 portion of this trial in December 2022.
Therapeutic Rationale in MYC-amplified tumors
MYC family transcription factors (CMYC, MYCN and MYCL) are master regulators of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation and metabolism, and are among the most frequently dysregulated targets in malignancies. While MYC can be up-regulated through various mechanisms and participates in many oncogenic TRNs, we believe that MYC gene copy number amplification is one of the clearest markers of transcriptional addiction. MYC amplification appears frequently in many common tumor types and is associated with aggressive disease. 
Percentage of Tumors in the National Cancer Institute’s the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Dataset (2018) With Copy Number Gains of MYC, MYCN or MYCL 
We believe that CDK9 is an attractive therapeutic target in transcriptionally addicted cancers, and specifically MYC-amplified solid tumors, due to its essential role in transcriptional elongation. MYC is critically dependent on CDK9 in order to drive transcription of downstream target genes and effect the oncogenic program. Additionally, a high rate of transcription is required to maintain elevated MYC protein levels, which creates an additional upstream dependency on large quantities of CDK9. These upstream and downstream dependencies are particularly acute in tumors with MYC genomic amplification, as these cells are addicted to high levels of MYC.
MYC Upstream and Downstream Regulation
In vivo efficacy modeling with KB-0742 was initially conducted in a MYC-dependent AML mouse xenograft model, MV4-11, and demonstrated dose dependent tumor growth inhibition at well-tolerated doses as measured by body weight. Assessment of PD markers in tumor also showed dose-dependent effects, including levels of pSer2 (a direct phosphorylation target of CDK9), MCL1 (an anti-apoptotic oncoprotein known to depend on CDK9) and cleaved PARP (a marker of apoptotic cell death). Importantly, we demonstrated that an intermittent dosing strategy of 60 mg/kg on a three days on / four days off schedule showed equivalent activity compared to the same amount of drug delivered with continuous daily dosing (25 mg/kg QD). We believe that intermittent dosing may be better tolerated clinically and has the potential to improve the therapeutic index for CDK9 inhibition.
MYC-Driven Xenograft Model
While the initial xenograft data in the AML cell line are encouraging, we believe that a greater therapeutic opportunity lies in treating MYC-amplified solid tumors. Based on large scale in vitro viability profiling of KB-0742, we observed that MYC genomic amplification is correlated with increased sensitivity to compound treatment in non-small cell lung cancer tumors.
Differential Sensitivity in MYC-Amplified NSCLC Cell Lines
Additional in vivo experiments are ongoing to inform selection of appropriate patient populations for clinical development of KB-0742
Differentiated Opportunity
We believe that KB-0742 represents a differentiated opportunity for targeting CDK9 based on its selectivity profile, oral bioavailability and extended plasma half-life.
Multiple CDK9 inhibitors are currently being investigated clinically; however, clinical results published to date have shown limited therapeutic index and, to our knowledge, none has advanced into late-stage clinical trials. We believe that three primary factors differentiate KB-0742 and our translational strategy, and may enable an enhanced potential therapeutic index relative to other programs:
CDK Selectivity. CDK9 bears a high degree of structural similarity to other CDK family members, and many of the previously reported CDK9 inhibitors possess significant inhibitory activity on other CDKs, including cell cycle CDKs. Even many purportedly selective CDK9 inhibitors have shown a relatively narrow fold-selectivity in biochemical assays, which may not be sufficient to avoid off-target activity at the physiologically relevant concentrations achieved in a clinical setting. This off-target activity may meaningfully contribute to the clinical profile of these molecules, and in particular we believe that a lack of selectivity against cell-cycle CDKs may introduce safety liabilities unrelated to the transcriptional mechanism of CDK9. In contrast, KB-0742 was highly selective for CDK9 over other CDK family members, potentially enabling a superior opportunity to achieve therapeutically-relevant target coverage in vivo without meaningful inhibition of off-target CDKs.

PK Profile and Dosing Schedule. Because of the essential role of CDK9 in all normal tissues, it is critical to optimize dosing schedule and duration of target coverage in order to achieve anti-tumor activity without eliciting undue toxicity in normal tissues. Based on our team’s prior experience developing anti-cancer agents targeting epigenetic targets, we are pursuing an intermittent dosing strategy, with the goal of maintaining a consistent level of target coverage for several days followed by a drug holiday to allow for recovery in normal tissue. Many other CDK9 inhibitors possess short half-life or are administered intravenously, resulting either in pulsatile target coverage or short overall duration of target coverage. By contrast, KB-0742 has demonstrated oral bioavailability and a twenty-four hour plasma half-life in humans. We believe that this is an attractive profile and affords the flexibility to establish a therapeutic index by varying dose and schedule to achieve optimal target coverage in tumor.
Patient Selection. We believe that the underlying biology of a tumor and degree of transcriptional addiction is critical in determining its sensitivity to CDK9 inhibition, and by extension, therapeutic index. Rather than selecting 
patients solely based on a tumor’s tissue of origin, we intend to take a differentiated approach to clinical translation by focusing on development in patient populations with clear genomic markers of transcriptional addiction including MYC amplification. 
Development Strategy
The FDA cleared our IND for KB-0742 in December 2020. In February 2021, we initiated the dose escalation stage of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of KB-0742 in cancer patients to evaluate its safety, PK and PD across multiple dose levels to identify a recommended dose and schedule. After having identified the recommended dose level and dosing schedule, we have begun enrolling expansion cohorts of patients with MYC-amplified solid tumors and other transcriptionally addicted tumor types, with the goal of assessing safety and PD response in these patient populations. We are continuing to dose escalate in the Phase 1 portion of the trial.
Two-Stage Phase 1/2 Dose Escalation Clinical Trial
Following identification of a recommended Phase 2 clinical trial dose and schedule, we are actively enrolling expansion cohorts in biomarker-defined patient populations with transcriptionally addicted cancers, including MYC-amplified solid tumors. Additionally, we are actively enrolling patients with transcription factor fusions and patients with chordoma, an incurable solid tumor addicted to the brachyury transcription factor. Although patients with these tumor types are relatively rare, we believe it is feasible to enroll such patients at major academic centers, which may provide a unique opportunity to demonstrate proof of concept for KB-0742. Clinical results from these expansion cohorts will inform the future development and registration strategy for KB-0742.
Our Next Generation SYK Inhibitor Product Candidate: Lanraplenib
Lanraplenib is a selective inhibitor of SYK, an important mediator of immunoreceptor signaling in hematopoietic cells with a clearly established role in both malignant and non-malignant hematologic disease. Lanraplenib was previously developed by Gilead for autoimmune indications and has been evaluated in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials in more than 250 patients including healthy volunteers and patients with autoimmune disease. Lanraplenib has exhibited improved PK properties compared with entospletinib, including an improved half-life, which is compatible with QD dosing among other benefits. 
Preclinical modeling suggests that dose levels selected for Phase 2 clinical trials of lanraplenib in autoimmune disease resulted in lower SYK target engagement compared to the dose of entospletinib used in hematologic malignancies. We believe that a higher dose of lanraplenib resulting in equivalent SYK target engagement 
achieved with entospletinib may create an opportunity to develop lanraplenib in oncology and other indications. Based on our detailed preclinical evaluation of lanraplenib, which showed equivalent anti-leukemic activity in head-to-head comparisons with entospletinib in various AML models, we are conducting a Phase 1b/2 trial in which we enrolled the first patient in August 2022, and which will evaluate lanraplenib in combination with gilteritinib in patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. 
Therapeutic Rationale for Targeting SYK in Genetically Defined Subsets of AML
AML is one of the most common forms of acute leukemia in adults. Despite multiple recent drug approvals, the disease still bears a poor prognosis with less than 30% of patients surviving five years from diagnosis. Although the median age at diagnosis is 67, only younger, typically less than 65 years old, and fitter patients are eligible for intensive chemotherapy, involving seven days treatment with cytarabine and three days treatment with an anthracycline drug such as daunorubicin or idarubicin (7+ 3). Approximately 60% to 70% of these patients achieve CR, but most will experience disease relapse in less than 18 months. Among patients who achieve CR but remain positive for minimal residual disease (MRD), remissions are often particularly short-lived. For older and less fit patients, prognosis is even worse. Therapeutic options for these patients have historically been limited to palliative treatment with HMAs with CR rates of approximately 30% followed by relapse within a matter of months in a majority of responding patients. 
SYK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that normally functions to mediate signaling between various cell surface receptors on myeloid cells and the transcriptional machinery. SYK activity becomes dysregulated because of certain recurring mutations in AML and is critical for the leukemogenic potential of these mutations. Specifically, mutated FLT3, a well-known driver of high-risk AML, needs to be phosphorylated by SYK for full leukemogenic potential. Mutations, predominantly internal tandem duplications, of FLT3 are found in approximately 30% of AML patients and are associated with a high risk of relapse and poor overall survival. A number of FLT3 inhibitors have recently been approved or are in development, including midostaurin, a first-generation inhibitor, which is approved in combination with 7 + 3 in newly diagnosed AML with FLT3 mutations. Quizartinib, a more selective second-generation inhibitor of FLT3, has also shown a survival benefit in newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML patients when combined with 7 + 3, but has not yet received FDA approval. Despite improved outcomes with the addition of FLT3 inhibitors to front line therapy, patients continue to relapse with FLT3-driven AML.

Gilteritinib is an oral, second generation FLT3 inhibitor that is approved as monotherapy for relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. In the ADMIRAL trial, patients treated with gilteritinib experienced a 21% CR rate and a median overall survival (OS) of 9.3 months as compared to 10.5% CR and 5.6 months OS with conventional salvage chemotherapy. While this was a significant improvement over the existing standard of care, fewer than 20% of relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients treated with gilteritinib survived at two years of follow-up. Moreover, the CR rate in patients who were treated with midostaurin in the front line, which has become more common since the approval of gilteritinib, may be as low as 16%. Thus, there continues to be a significant unmet need for patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. We hypothesize that concurrent inhibition of FLT3 and SYK will lead to superior anti-leukemic activity compared to inhibition of either kinase alone.
In patient-derived preclinical models of FLT3-mutation driven AML we have observed greater than additive anti-leukemic activity with the combination of lanraplenib and gilteritinib. Combination anti-leukemic activity was also seen in vivo in preclinical models of FLT3-mutation driven AML. Leukemic cell burden in mice was decreased and survival was increased when lanraplenib was administered with gilteritinib compared to lanraplenib or gilteritinib given alone.
In addition to its role as a key mediator of FLT3 leukemogenic signaling, SYK has been implicated as a critical node in AML driven by the dysregulated HOXA9/MEIS1 TRN. HOXA9 and MEIS1 are transcription factors that work together to drive a gene expression program in primitive myeloid cells. As these cells normally mature, expression of these transcription factors is down-regulated. Mutations of NPM1, found in approximately 30% of AML patients (often in association with FLT3 mutations) and rearrangements of the KMT2A (MLL) gene (MLLr) which occur in 5 – 10% of AML patients, prevent the physiologic down-regulation of HOXA9 and MEIS1. SYK expression and activity are upregulated as a consequence of high HOXA9 and MEIS1 expression and this elevated SYK activity is critical for the leukemogenic potential of NPM1 mutations and MLL rearrangements. 
The figure below is based on our internal analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data from over 400 AML patient samples obtained through the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s “Beat AML” program. The figure below depicts mRNA levels for either the HOXA9 or MEIS1 genes across the common AML driver mutations NPM1 (left) and MLL-r (right). For each AML driver mutation, HOXA9 and MEIS1 mRNA levels are shown for either patients that are wildtype for that mutation (grey boxes) or mutated (blue boxes). For each cohort (wild type or mutant), outliers are defined as those patients with mRNA levels exceeding 1.5x the interquartile range (IQR). In all cases, AML driver mutations are associated with increased mRNA levels of HOXA9 and MEIS1 that are consistent with a failure to down-regulate HOX/MEIS expression and are considered statistically significant by a two-sided Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test.
Entospletinib has shown clinical activity in these mutationally defined AML subsets including 3 CRs among 23 MLLr patients treated with entospletinib monotherapy, consistent the hypothesis that inhibiting SYK is a promising therapeutic approach for these subsets of AML. Although for strategic reasons we recently discontinued the AGILITY Phase 3 trial which was testing this hypothesis in newly diagnosed NPM1 mutated AML patients in combination with 7 + 3, we believe that this remains a compelling opportunity for lanraplenib in combination with MLL-MENIN inhibitors such as Sydax’s SNDX-5613 or Kura’s KO539.
Inhibitors of the interaction between MLL and its cofactor MENIN have shown promising activity in NPM1 mutated and MLLr relapsed or refractory AML. Based on published data, SNDX-5613 has been tested in 48 patients with NPM1 mutation or MLLr and has shown a composite CR rate (CR + CRh) of 27% in both subsets. Fewer patients (N = 20) have been dosed with KO539 for a composite CR rate of 5.6% in MLLr and 30% in NPM1 mutated patients. 
We hypothesize that concurrent inhibition of the MLL-MENIN interaction, upstream of dysregulated HOXA9/MEIS1, and SYK, downstream of HOXA9/MEIS1, can lead to improvement in both the rate and depth of CR, leading to longer survival. Preliminary data that is consistent with this hypothesis and generated by our research team is summarized below. The MLLr AML cell lines MV411 and MOLM13 were treated in vitro with lanraplenib or SNDX-5613 individually or in combination and the effects on differentiation (CD11b expression) and apoptosis (annexin V) were measured after 9 days. The combination treatment resulted in synergistic increases in both differentiation and apoptosis.
We believe that lanraplenib and MLL-MENIN inhibitors could be a promising combination to explore in a future clinical trial. 
Background on our Research and Development Strategy: Targeting the Activity of Oncogenic Transcription Factors through their Transcription Regulatory Networks (TRNs)
Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences on the genome and control how sets of genes are turned on and off. This ability to exert systematic control on gene expression underlies the functional importance of transcription factors and consequently, transcription factor activity is recurrently deregulated in many human cancers. This is exemplified by two transcription factors: MYC, the most commonly amplified oncogene, and p53, the most commonly inactivated tumor suppressor gene. Together, these two genes account for two thirds of all human cancers. The human genome encodes more than 500 transcription factors, of which more than 30% have been functionally implicated in cancer, including in recent pan-cancer genetic screens that identify highly selective tumor dependencies.
While there are examples of approved therapies that directly target transcription factor activity (such as those targeting the nuclear hormone family of transcription factors which contain ligand binding domains, or those which act as molecular glues that degrade zinc finger transcription factors), transcription factors as a class remain challenging drug targets. Traditional drug discovery approaches have struggled to target transcription factors for two main reasons. First, most are considered intrinsically disordered proteins, which means that when recombinantly purified they fail to adopt a defined structure, rendering most biochemical and biophysical drug screening approaches unusable. Second, most transcription factors lack active sites or “ligandable” pockets within their protein structure that can be used to modulate their activity. The core biological activity of transcription factors is their ability to recruit cofactors and form large multi-subunit protein complexes on the genome; however, it is only in a cellular context that transcription factors bind to such cofactors and form a unique and defined protein structure. To overcome these two challenges, we believe transcription factors must be drugged in their appropriate physiological context.
Our approach to drug discovery addresses this by mapping and understanding transcription factor activity within the context of its TRN. Within a tumor, a dysregulated network of hundreds of regulatory proteins, including cell-signaling proteins, transcription factors, epigenetic regulators and core transcriptional machinery, coordinate to drive the oncogenic gene expression program. These interactions are dynamic, interdependent and frequently contain redundant pathways, compensatory mechanisms or feedback loops that may drive resistance to targeted therapies. Collectively these hundreds of interactions make up an oncogenic TRN.
By mapping a specific oncogenic TRN, we believe we are better able to understand the context of transcription factor dependency, which can inform both model selection at the discovery stage and patient biomarker strategy in the clinic. Additionally, TRN maps enumerate the specific inputs and outputs of gene 
expression, which can provide insights into how TRNs can be perturbed as well as direct readouts of TRN perturbation. Such direct readouts are crucial in enabling the development of assays to identify on-target TRN perturbation and to distinguish selective inhibition of transcription factor activity from less desirable global inhibition of transcription. 
Understanding the structure of a TRN also helps inform our target selection. In an oncogenic TRN, many parallel signals and feedback loops converge to define and drive cancer. Dysregulated transcription factors are the proteins that directly control aberrant transcription of the genome and are critical nodes in oncogenic TRNs. These TRNs may also contain additional critical nodes of signaling or epigenetic regulation that play an essential role in perpetuating the oncogenic TRN. Our core hypothesis is that TRNs are most easily targeted by drugging their critical nodes. We believe these critical nodes present attractive therapeutic targets that expand the opportunity to target transcription factor activity in cancer. By potentially collapsing the oncogenic TRN, therapies directed to these targets hold the promise of limiting potential mechanisms for resistance. 
The figure below illustrates an example TRN and shows how the structure of a TRN can be altered in a tumor specific context. In this diagram, nodes represent distinct proteins and edges represent functional, regulatory, or genetic interactions. Upregulation of oncogenic signaling can alter the activity of nodes and edges (shown in red) leading to oncogenic activation of gene expression at tumor specific loci across the genome. These subnetworks within the TRN are associated with tumor specific activity and are likely to contain critical nodes, proteins that play an outsized role in maintaining a tumor specific TRN and are relied upon for the survival of the tumor. Critical nodes may be points of convergence for multiple signaling pathways, components of positive feedback loops, or effector proteins that regulate many other processes. Since transcription factors themselves can regulate many hundreds or more genes, transcription factors are often critical nodes within TRNs. 
Example Output of Mapping TRN in Oncogenic versus Normal Context
Our Product Engine
Our differentiated product engine comprises three interconnected components. First, we integrate diverse multiomic data from cancer model systems with clinical real-world evidence to map the TRN of interest. Next, we apply our expertise in systems biology and drug discovery to define the mechanistic basis of TRN tumor dependency. Third, we use this tumor dependency information to identify small molecule modulators in one of two ways: either through use of our proprietary SMM screening platform in an “unbiased” manner, or through a more “biased” approach where we direct our screening efforts against identified TRN critical nodes. These elements of our product engine are shown in the figure below. 
Mapping TRNs by Integrating multiomic data and real-world evidence 
TRN maps represent the summation of multiple regulatory layers (genetic, signaling, chromatin, epigenomic, protein-protein interaction) that converge in the nucleus to establish and maintain the cell’s gene expression program. In mapping TRNs, we address two major challenges that enable, which enables us to better generate actionable drug discovery insights that drive our drug discovery efforts. 
First, we seek to identify TRN maps in the appropriate context that capture their tumor-specific deregulation. As an example, to map the MYC TRN, we analyze how MYC amplification rewires the tumor cell TRN to create positive feedback loops that stabilize and upregulate MYC activity in a manner not seen in normal cells. To ensure that the TRN maps faithfully recapitulate true patient tumor biology, we integrate pan-cancer multiomic data, which helps us understand a broader and more defined TRN map, with clinical real-world evidence drawn from thousands of cancer patients. This also lays the foundation for later patient selection and biomarker development. 
Defining the mechanistic basis of TRN tumor dependencies
Our initial TRN maps, like many big-data networks, contain many thousands of nodes and edges and are too complex to be immediately actionable. To address this, we have developed computational biology capabilities that we deploy to identify direct transcription factor regulatory modules that we validate using high throughput functional perturbations. These modules allow us to transform our TRN maps from being associative and correlative to causal and predictive. This enables us to understand the consequences of perturbing individual nodes in the TRN, which in turn can drive assay development and the nomination of critical nodes in target selection.
We believe our approach to TRN mapping may reveal actionable critical nodes throughout the TRN, including lineage-defining transcription factors, epigenetic factors and non-redundant pathway or co-factor dependencies required to execute the oncogenic program. This is especially valuable when targeting dysregulated transcription factors that act in a highly context-dependent manner and are difficult to target using conventional methods. 
Identifying TRN modulators by using our SMM screening platform or by direct targeting of critical nodes 
Our proprietary SMM screening platform addresses the historical challenges of context-dependent structures and complexes by allowing us to conduct a high throughput screen for protein complex binders directly in a tumor cell lysate. 
Because SMM lysate screens probe the entire target protein interactome in a single assay, SMM hits have the potential to engage the target protein and its complexes through at least three distinct binding modes:
•Direct binder. These molecules may directly engage the target protein either at an active domain or an allosteric site.
•PPI Modulator. These molecules may bind a pocket or groove that is created by a protein-protein interface in complexes containing the target protein. 
•Co-factor binder. These molecules may bind an essential co-factor of the target protein.
Small Molecule Microarray Identifies Binders to TRN Constituents
Hits derived from an SMM screen have the potential to bind different members of the target protein complex and act through a variety of mechanisms. Our approach is to identify selective modulators of TRNs rather than modulators that globally alter transcription. We hypothesize that selective on-target TRN modulators should have a better therapeutic index in that they will selectively inhibit TRN-driven oncogenic gene expression programs while sparing normal transcription. Our ability to properly characterize the transcriptional selectivity of small molecule perturbations will be crucial in developing and optimizing TRN modulators and is akin to assessing the substrate selectivity and off targets of more traditional drugs like enzymatic inhibitors. In contrast to traditional drug discovery triages, which focus on identifying compounds with a particular activity or profile, SMM hit triage must account for multiple distinct hit profiles. 
From our context dependent TRN maps, one way that we characterize SMM hits is by generating and experimentally validating signatures of gene expression response that can delineate various forms of TRN perturbation ranging from degradation of a key transcription factor to inhibition of cofactors in upstream signaling pathways. As shown in the figure below, we generate signatures of approximately 24-48 genes whose change in expression we know to be associated with known perturbations of the TRN, such as genetic knockdown of a key transcription factor or chemical inhibition of a cofactor. Signatures include TRN responsive genes as well as control genes, such as GAPDH, which we know to be invariant to TRN perturbation. We use NanoString gene expression to profile how SMM hits impact these TRN signatures in a high throughput manner. For each gene in a signature, NanoString generates a hybridization reporter with a unique fluorescent barcode, as seen on the left. These reporters enable a multiplexed readout of mRNA abundance of these signature genes which allow us to profile the gene expression changes caused by SMM hits. This robust transcriptomic profiling enables us to rapidly advance hits that selectively perturb the oncogenic TRN and exclude compounds with dominant off-target/off-pathway activity, as depicted in the figure below. 
Hit Prioritization for On-target TRN Activity
The second way we characterize SMM hits is by investigating specific mechanisms of action that emerged as critical nodes from our TRN maps, including for example assaying SMM hits for their ability to disrupt a protein-protein interaction or their ability to inhibit a druggable cofactor. In any given SMM TRN screen we may have multiple of these critical node mechanisms that we can bias our hit triage towards. Having two methods of hit characterization allows us to characterize both hits that have on-target gene expression activity in an unbiased manner as well as to find hits that modulate predefined mechanisms of interest. 
In addition to identifying functional binders using gene expression signatures, we mine our SMM hits for non-functional binders to known critical node proteins. Because they bind to the target protein while also being covalently attached to the array slide via a chemical linker, SMM hits are well positioned to be transformed into heterobifunctional molecules. The attachment site of this chemical linker is used as a starting point to rapidly functionalize these SMM hits, including converting these hits into heterobifunctional proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders, in order to achieve TRN modulatory activity.
Independent of our SMM screen, we have used other aspects of our product engine to identify critical nodes for which there are existing drugs or chemical matter. For example, we acquired the SYK inhibitor portfolio from Gilead because we perceived an opportunity to target a dysregulated AML TRN driven by high levels of the HOX/MEIS transcription factor family. From our mapping of this TRN, we identified mutations to NPM1 (NPM1c) as directly driving high HOX/MEIS levels and SYK as participating in a key positive feedback loop with HOX/MEIS. This provided a mechanistic basis for SYK dependency in the NPM1c mutant AML patient subset. We used detection of NPM1c mutations as a clinical biomarker for patient selection and from our HOX/MEIS TRN map we developed a more refined signature of on-target SYK inhibition and its downstream consequences for use in our pharmacodynamics measurements. Our product engine enables us to take different approaches to modulating TRNs and identify context-specific critical nodes that can be more easily acted upon either by traditional drug discovery approaches or through existing external programs. 
Optimizing Lead TRN Modulator Molecules 
Once we have identified a lead molecule, we investigate the connection between molecular characteristics and target engagement to refine or optimize the pharmacological properties of the molecule to match the desired clinical product profile. We employ our robust medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry and assay development capabilities to support such lead optimization. 
We tailor our lead optimization strategy to the specific program that gave rise to the lead molecule. We design structure-activity relationship studies to guide optimization toward a specific transcriptional signature in relevant cancer cell lines. For hits with a known binding site and ordered structure, we also leverage computational modeling, structure-based drug design and a suite of biochemical or biophysical assays to rapidly advance lead optimization programs. For hits against historically challenging targets not amenable to biochemical or biophysical screening assays, we have the capability to advance chemistry programs using structure-blind medicinal chemistry approaches that are informed by transcriptional readouts in cell-based assays. 
Our Approach to Clinical Trial Design
We leverage our extensive computational biology capabilities to identify predictive biomarkers for drug response and key pharmacodynamic markers of activity within the oncogenic TRN. We then seek to establish in preclinical models the required extent and duration of target coverage required to achieve clinical efficacy without eliciting undue toxicity in normal tissue. For example, while continuous dosing strategies may be appropriate for certain targets, such as SYK, intermittent dosing strategies may be essential for establishing a therapeutic index for other targets, such as CDK9. 
We apply this understanding of predictive markers and the pharmacodynamic/efficacy relationship to design early clinical studies that can efficiently identify an optimal dose and dosing schedule for a given product candidate, and potentially achieve clinical proof of concept in a biomarker-defined patient population. This targeted approach may also enable a more efficient late-stage clinical development and registration strategy by focusing on the patients most likely to benefit from treatment and potentially to pursue more efficient regulatory approval pathways.
Discovery Programs
We continually invest in early discovery efforts utilizing our proprietary product engine, with the goal of expanding our pipeline of future product candidates. Our current efforts are focused on four cancer types where dysregulated TRNs play a central role. We believe that we can develop a deep understanding of the underlying cancer dependency, engineer robust systems to characterize perturbation signatures, and identify multiple potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention through modulation of key TRN components. We select our discovery targets based on multiple scientific, translational and competitive considerations, prioritizing those where dependency has been demonstrated in a defined patient population with high unmet medical need, and where we believe we can design an efficient early clinical translation strategy based upon our understanding of the disease biology.
•HOX/MEIS, MYB, IRF4 and Hematologic Malignancies. Despite significant advances in medical management of patients with hematologic malignancies, the majority of patients eventually progress through standard of care therapy and long-term outcomes remain poor. There is a demonstrated need for novel and more durable treatments for hematologic malignancies, including AML and multiple myeloma. In addition to our clinical SYK inhibitor program in HOX/MEIS-high AML, we are actively conducting discovery efforts targeting MYB, a key lineage transcription factor in early hematopoiesis that is dysregulated in leukemia and interacts with many known leukemia driver genes. We are also actively conducting discovery efforts on IRF4, which is a major driver of multiple myeloma and which is downstream of the primary resistance pathway for thalidomide analogs.
•AR and Prostate Cancer. Dysregulation of the androgen receptor (AR) TRN is a primary driver of prostate cancer. Multiple approved products target the AR TRN by directly inhibiting AR, such as enzalutamide or apalutamide, or by inhibiting androgen biosynthesis, such as abiraterone acetate. Although androgen deprivation therapy is effective in controlling disease, a large number of patients ultimately develop therapy resistance and succumb to castration-resistant prostate cancers. Castration resistance is commonly induced by certain AR variants, such as ARv7, that lack the ligand binding domain and consequently are no longer considered conventionally druggable. Critically, these AR variant tumors still are driven by and depend on increased activity of the AR TRN. Our discovery efforts seek to identify novel modulators of AR TRN activity that are effective in tumor lines expressing AR variants.
•MYC and MYC-Driven Cancers. The MYC family of dysregulated transcription factors is among the small number of proto-oncogenes capable of driving tumor formation and growth in a wide variety of contexts. In normal cells, MYC acts at the nexus of multiple signaling pathways to coordinate gene expression 
programs associated with cell growth, metabolism and proliferation. In tumors, MYC dysregulation is defined by increased levels and activity of the full length MYC transcription factor. MYC is dysregulated in a significant proportion of malignancies and its dysregulation is associated with aggressive disease and poor clinical outcomes. As such, targeting MYC has long been considered one of the great challenges in developing cancer therapeutics. In many MYC dysregulated tumors, oncogenic driver events rewire the MYC TRN to introduce positive feedback loops that lead to runaway MYC activation. In addition to our CDK9 program, which focuses on the treatment of patients with MYC-amplified solid tumors, we are focusing discovery efforts to find additional modulators of the MYC TRN.
•ASCL1 and SCNC. Tumor cells can transition between cell states, or subtypes, in response to therapy as a means of acquiring resistance and becoming more aggressive. In particular, many solid tumors adapt to and eventually overcome standard of care therapy as a result of transitions into a SCNC subtype. SCNC state transitions are common in small cell lung cancer, and are also observed in neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer, and patients with these cancers face a very poor prognosis. The transcription factor ASCL1 has emerged as a critical node in the SCNC TRN. It is both a biomarker of the SCNC subtype and a demonstrated dependency in these cancers. Our discovery efforts currently focus on identifying modulators of ASCL1 transcription factor activity within the SCNC TRN.
Future Opportunities
While many opportunities remain within oncology, dysregulated TRNs also play a central role in many other disease states. Future applications of our differentiated product engine in the immunology field may hold particular promise, especially with respect to targeting TRNs that influence the tumor microenvironment and anti-tumor immune response or tolerance. As our discovery organization continues to grow, we intend to regularly re-evaluate our discovery pipeline and seek to identify additional opportunities to fully exploit our differentiated product engine. 
Strategic Agreements
Genentech Collaboration Agreement
On January 6, 2023, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Pursuant to the agreement, the parties have agreed to initially collaborate on two discovery research programs in oncology, each focused on a designated transcription factor, to discover small-molecule GLP-Tox-ready candidates that modulate transcription factor targets selected by Genentech. Each discovery research program will primarily consist of (i) a mapping phase with the goal of identifying the transcription regulatory network for such designated transcription factor, and (ii) a screening phase having the goal of identifying and characterizing multiple screening hits suitable for nomination as a preclinical development program. 
We will lead discovery and research activities under the discovery research programs and will use our proprietary drug discovery platform, including our SMM, for hit finding. Following the completion of initial discovery and research activities, Genentech will have the exclusive right to pursue further preclinical and clinical development and commercialization of compounds identified in the discovery research programs and designated by Genentech (each, a Hit Program).
In connection with the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $20.0 million from Genentech.

discretion, at any time by providing 60 days’ advance written notice to us. Each party may also terminate the agreement upon the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 90 days (or 45 days in the event of nonpayment), or in the event of certain insolvency events involving the other party.
Tempus R&D Services Agreement
In October 2021, we entered into an agreement for research and development services (Tempus Agreement) with Tempus Labs, Inc. (Tempus), pursuant to which Tempus agreed to provide us with research and development services for a period of three years. The three primary services are analytical services, data licensing, and organoid services. We intend to utilize the services contemplated under the Tempus Agreement to advance the development of KB-0742 and lanraplenib.
In consideration for the access to the services throughout the term of the Tempus Agreement, we have agreed to pay an annual minimum commitment of $1.5 million in year one, $2.0 million in year two, and $2.5 million in year three. Payments are made in quarterly installments. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid $1.1 million under the Tempus Agreement.
In addition, we are required to make milestone payments upon successful achievement of certain regulatory milestones for KB-0742, lanraplenib, and other discovery pipeline compounds up to a combined maximum of $22.4 million. For each milestone payment that becomes due, we have the right to pay up to 50% of such milestone payment amount in shares of our common stock as long as certain regulatory requirements are met.
Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement 
In July 2020, we entered into the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired certain assets from and assumed certain liabilities of Gilead related to entospletinib and lanraplenib, and patents and other intellectual property covering or related to the development, manufacture and commercialization of entospletinib and lanraplenib.
In consideration for such assets, on the date of the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement, we made a $3.0 million upfront cash payment and issued a $3.0 million principal amount convertible promissory note, which was settled in exchange for 188,567 shares of common stock in connection with the closing of our IPO at a settlement price of $16.15 per share. We also made a $0.7 million payment to reimburse Gilead for certain liabilities we assumed pursuant to the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement. In addition, we are required to make milestone payments upon successful achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones for lanraplenib, entospletinib and other SYK inhibitor compounds covered by the patent rights acquired pursuant to the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement and developed by us as a back-up to entospletinib or lanraplenib (Other Compounds). Upon successful completion of certain regulatory milestones in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom for lanraplenib, entospletinib and any Other Compounds, across up to two distinct indications, we will be required to pay to Gilead an aggregate total of $51.3 million. Upon achieving certain thresholds for the aggregate annual net sales of lanraplenib, entospletinib, and any Other Compounds combined, we would owe to Gilead potential milestone payments totaling $115.0 million.
Gilead is also eligible to receive (i) tiered marginal royalties ranging from high-single digits to the mid-teens on annual worldwide net sales of lanraplenib, (ii) tiered marginal royalties ranging from the very low-teens to high-teens on annual worldwide net sales of entospletinib, and (iii) tiered marginal royalties ranging from the low single digits to mid-single digits on annual worldwide net sales of any Other Compounds. The royalties in the foregoing clauses are subject to reduction, on a country-by-country basis, for products not covered by certain claims within the assigned patents, for generic entry and, in the case of lanraplenib and entospletinib, for any royalties paid for future licenses of third-party intellectual property required to develop or commercialize lanraplenib or entospletinib. Our royalty obligation with respect to a given product in a given country begins upon the first commercial sale of such product in such country and ends on the latest of (i) expiration of the last claim of a defined set of the assigned patent rights covering such product in such country, (ii) loss of exclusive data or marketing rights to such product in such country or (iii) 10 years from the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
Under the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize either entospletinib or lanraplenib. 
Gilead is required, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify us against damages arising out of any breach in the representations or warranties made by Gilead, any breach of a covenant by Gilead, any use or exploitation of the acquired assets by or on behalf of Gilead prior to the closing of the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement, or any liability not specifically assumed by us under the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement, subject to certain caps. Likewise, we are required, subject to certain limitations, to indemnify Gilead against damages arising out of any breach of our representations and warranties, any breach of a covenant made in the agreement, any use or exploitation of the acquired assets by us or on our behalf on or after the closing of the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement, or any assumed liability, subject to certain caps.
Harvard License Agreement
In January 2018, we entered into a license agreement with President and Fellows of Harvard College (Harvard), pursuant to which Harvard granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to certain patent rights covering aspects of our SMM platform. We paid a one-time license fee in the amount of $10,000 on the date of the agreement and an annual license maintenance fee of $20,000 on each of the first two anniversaries. We are required to pay $25,000 on each subsequent anniversary until the last to expire of any valid claim included in the licensed patents.
Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement, the agreement will continue until the last to expire of any valid claim of the licensed patents. In addition, the agreement can be terminated (i) by either party for the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 30 days after written notice, (ii) by Harvard if we fail to meet certain insurance obligations immediately without notice, and for certain insolvency-related events upon notice, and (iii) by us, for any reason, upon 60 days’ written notice.
Sales and Marketing
We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of any of our product candidates that receives regulatory approval. We expect to manage sales, marketing and distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we will also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture of any products that we may commercialize. In this regard, while we have purchased initial inventory of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and clinical drug supply for lanraplenib from Gilead under the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement, we will need to obtain further supplies of APIs and clinical drug supply for lanraplenib and KB-0742 from third-party manufacturers. We are initially obtaining our supplies from manufacturers on a purchase order basis without long-term supply arrangements in place. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply for APIs and drug product. For all of our product candidates, we intend to identify and qualify manufacturers to provide the APIs and drug product prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA or other marketing authorization applications to other regulatory authorities.
All our product candidates are compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured from readily available starting materials in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes that are amenable to scale-up and do not require specialized equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary drugs. We operate in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address inhibition of kinases and targeting transcriptional regulation in cancer. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages we hope to exploit, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, 
academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and ultimately commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future. 
In the case of lanraplenib, there are currently no approved products on the market that combine with gilteritinib in relapsed or refractory AML with FLT3 mutation. However, there are product candidates that are currently in clinical development which, if approved, could compete or potentially be complementary with lanraplenib including: (i) HMPL-523, a SYK inhibitor being developed by Hutchison Medipharma Ltd. that is in Phase 1 evaluation in hematologic malignancies; (ii) product candidates in early clinical development that target the interaction between MLL and MENIN in MLL-r and AML patients with NPM1 mutations, including (a) DS-1594, being developed by Daiichi Sankyo Company in a Phase 1 clinical trial with or without azacitidine/venetoclax in relapsed/refractory AML; (b) JNJ-75276617, being developed by Janssen Research & Development, LLC in a Phase 1 clinical trial in acute leukemias; (c) KO-539, being developed by Kura Oncology, Inc. in a Phase 1 clinical trial as monotherapy in relapsed or refractory AML; and (d) SNDX-5613, being developed by Syndax Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in a Phase 1 clinical trial as monotherapy in relapsed or refractory AML in patients with MLL-r/KMT2A gene rearrangement or NPM1 mutations; and (iii) product candidates that address the subset of AML patients with FLT3 mutations and are currently in development in combination with FLT3 inhibitors, including (a) venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor being developed by Abbvie; (b) CC-90009, a A Cereblon E3 ligase modulating drug that promotes selective degradation of GSPT1, in Phase 1b, being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb; (c) CPX-351, a liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine being developed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals; and (d) ladademstat, an LSD1 inhibitorm in Phase 1 dose escalation being developed by Oryzon.
If we are successful in developing and receiving approval for KB-0742, we expect it would compete against various multi-CDK inhibitors that are currently in early-stage clinical development if they are ultimately approved, including: (a) AZD4573, being developed by AstraZeneca; (b) fadraciclib (CYC-065), being developed by Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals; (c) voruciclib, being developed by MEI Pharma; (d) dinaciclib, being developed by Merck & Co.; (e) zotiraciclib, being developed by the National Cancer Institute; and (f) TP-1287 (alvocidib), being developed by Tolero Pharmaceuticals. We also expect it to compete against (a) GFH009, a CDK9 inhibitor in Phase 1 dose escalation, being developed by Genfleet Therapeutics; (b) PRT2527, a CDK9 inhibitor in Phase 1 dose escalation by Prelude Therapeutics; and (c) VIP152, a PTEFb/CDK9 inhibitor in early-stage clinical development by Vincerx Pharma, Inc.
Many of the companies against which we may ultimately compete have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our potential competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
We could see a reduction or elimination in our commercial opportunity if other companies develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, are less expensive or with a more favorable label than any of our product candidates. These companies also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in their establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the effectiveness of companion diagnostics, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our most advanced product candidates, lanraplenib and KB-0742, our future product candidates, as well as novel discoveries, product development technologies, and know-how. Our commercial success also depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our 
proprietary rights. Our policy is to develop and maintain protection of our proprietary position and freedom to operate by, among other means, filing and prosecuting, or in-licensing or acquiring U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering those products, technologies, inventions, and improvements that are important to our business.
We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, confidentiality agreements, and invention assignment agreements to develop and maintain our proprietary position. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and the invention assignment agreements are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed by our employees, consultants, or other third parties. We seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in our agreements and security measures, either may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors. 
With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of using and manufacturing the same. 
We are actively building our intellectual property portfolio around our product candidates and our discovery programs, based on our own intellectual property as well as licensed intellectual property. Following the execution of the Gilead Asset Purchase Agreement, we are the owners of multiple patents and patent applications in the United States and worldwide directed to the composition of matter and methods of use of lanraplenib and entospletinib and other related SYK inhibitor compounds. 
Our patent portfolio in general includes patents and patent applications directed to our lead product candidates, lanraplenib and KB-0742 and our other research-stage candidates, all of which are solely owned by us. We also have patents and patent applications directed to entospletinib.
With respect to lanraplenib as of February 1, 2023, our patent portfolio included seven issued U.S. patents, 106 issued or granted foreign patents, and 28 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications claiming lanraplenib as a composition-of-matter, methods of using lanraplenib, and its polymorphic forms and their use, all with nominal terms extending to between 2034 and 2043. Nominal patent terms are determined as 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date to which priority is claimed, and do not take into account extensions that are or may be available.
With respect to KB-0742, as of February 1, 2023, we have one issued U.S. patent, two issued or granted foreign patents, and 42 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications directed to the KB-0742 compound, compositions, methods of treating CDK9-mediated diseases with KB-0742, analogs and polymorphic forms of KB-0742, and other research-stage candidate compounds that modulate CDK9 activity, all with nominal terms extending to between 2039 and 2042. Nominal patent terms are determined as 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date to which priority is claimed, and do not take into account extensions that are or may be available. 
As of February 1, 2023, our patent portfolio related to entospletinib included over 17 issued U.S. patents, 149 issued or granted foreign patents, and 28 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, claiming entospletinib as a composition of matter, formulations, polymorphic forms or their methods of use or manufacture, all with nominal terms extending to between 2029 and 2043. Nominal patent terms are determined as 20 years from the earliest non-provisional filing date to which priority is claimed, and do not take into account extensions that are or may be available. 
Our SMM platform component of our product engine is protected both by certain patents that we have licensed under the Harvard License, as well as proprietary know-how we have generated, including with respect to its use in drug discovery screening against transcription factors in tumor cell lysate. We continue to assess the extent to which we may seek additional patent protection for aspects of our product engine or instead maintain such intellectual property as trade secrets.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. In the United States, patent term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for a patent term extension of up to five years under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which is designed to compensate for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent term extension is calculated based on the length of time it takes for regulatory review. A patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be restored. Moreover, a patent can only be restored once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before it may be legally marketed in the United States.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA’s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent IRB ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology, and PD characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
•Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
U.S. Review and Approval Process
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the NDA with a REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. With regard to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals.
In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials and report to FDA regularly on the progress of such trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Post-approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
•clinical holds on clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of drug products. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent professional medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA and other regulatory agencies have also required that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA-approved labelling.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2) (505(b)(2) NDA), submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval and include, without limitation: 
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act;
•the federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered entities, including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and
•the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The information reported is publicly available on a searchable website, with disclosure required annually.
State and local healthcare laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope than their federal counterparts and apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information; state and local laws which require tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities or that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and local laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Privacy Laws
We may be subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security as a result of our employee data or other personal information that we may collect. In addition, when we collect personal data as part of any clinical trials or other testing, we may be subject to regulatory obligations. This includes, (i) in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, (ii) in the European Union, or EU, and the European Economic Area, or EEA, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or EU GDPR, (iii) in the United Kingdom, or UK, the UK GDPR, and (iv) the national rules of the individual EU Member States. New privacy rules are being enacted in the U.S. and globally, and existing ones are being expanded, updated and strengthened. 
For example, California enacted the CCPA, which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. Both the CCPA and CPRA could impact our business activities depending on how they are interpreted and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.
Additionally, the GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing activities and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal data is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; defines pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are also subject to EU rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the EU and EEA. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EU’s standard contractual clauses, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Fines for certain breaches of the GDPR are significant: up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR or other applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, or potential civil claims including class action type litigation.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufactures to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately and can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are more and more challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, (collectively, the ACA) was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for 
such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. \On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which, among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is unclear how any additional challenges and healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business. 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect until 2031 absent additional congressional action. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders, and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but it is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. In addition, individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.

FDA Approval and Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
If safe and effective use of a therapeutic depends on an in vitro diagnostic, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of that diagnostic, known as a companion diagnostic, at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, if FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic device is not approved or cleared for that indication. Approval or clearance of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population. The review of in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our therapeutic treatments for cancer will, therefore, likely involve coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (PMA approval).
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, a PMA application typically requires data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicant’s agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s 
manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States.
Human Capital Resources
As of January 1, 2023, we had 97 employees, all of whom were full-time. Substantially all of our employees work out of our offices in either San Mateo, California, or Cambridge, Massachusetts. We have three dedicated, full-time employee equivalents responsible for executing our human capital management strategy and overseeing all aspects of our human resources processes in place to support our employees. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Since our founding, we have had relatively low turnover of employees, which we attribute to our shared mission of transforming the lives of those affected by cancer. 
Our employees are essential to our success. We have been purposeful, within our resource constraints, in our efforts to hire, develop and retain diverse talent as well as create an inclusive culture. We are investing in building and maintaining a work environment that prioritizes the health, safety and wellness of our team, and where our employees are inspired to deliver their best every day. All employees are responsible for upholding the Kronos Bio Code of Conduct, which forms the foundation of our policies and practices. We are continuing to expand our systems to track key human capital metrics such as demographics, diversity, compensation and benefits, and engagement.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We are committed to creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive and safe work environment. Our employees bring diversity to our workplace across many critical categories, and we believe our company is stronger as a result of their variety of experiences and backgrounds. For example, just under half our employees self-identify as women, and over half of our employees in medical or scientific roles self-identify as members of underrepresented communities and nearly half self-identify as women. As we grow and mature, we look forward to establishing programs that bring in speakers on specific topics, assemble resources for employees on diversity and inclusion, provide support for our female and underrepresented employees to help advance their careers, all while continuing to focus on hiring, developing and promoting diverse talent at all levels of the company.
Compensation and Benefits 
Our commitment to our employees starts with benefit and compensation programs that value employees’ contributions and offer financial and health programs for employees and their families. We strive to provide competitive compensation, benefits and services that serve to attract and retain employees. Our compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses and broad-based stock awards, healthcare and retirement benefits, and unlimited paid time off. We also offer an Employee Stock Purchase Program through which employees can purchase company stock at a discounted price, and offer stipends to cover expenses associated with working from home and the use of personal devices for work purposes. Additionally, we continue to advance transparency in our pay and representation data by complying with all applicable statutory filing requirements. 
Communication and Engagement
We strongly believe that Kronos Bio’s success depends on our employees understanding how their work contributes to the company’s overall mission and strategy. We strive to foster open and direct communication and seek to empower our employees to be our greatest ambassadors. We use a variety of channels to facilitate this, including quarterly business updates from the senior management team; regular town hall meetings, open forums and online platforms, and company-wide written communications; and employee engagement surveys. 
Health, Wellness and Safety 
Employee safety and well-being is of paramount importance to us. We provide productivity and collaboration tools and resources, allow flexible schedules and support employees’ information technology needs. We also regularly promote employee assistance programs to support our employees’ physical, financial and mental well-being.
