ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Miller Industries is The World’s Largest Manufacturer of Towing and Recovery Equipment®, with executive offices in Ooltewah, Tennessee, domestic manufacturing operations in Tennessee and Pennsylvania, and foreign manufacturing operations in France and the United Kingdom.
In 1990, we began developing or acquiring several of the most well-recognized brands in the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry. Since that time, our strategy has been to diversify our line of products and increase our presence in the industry through internal growth and development, although we remain open to opportunities for acquisitions of complementary products.
In this Annual Report, the words “Miller Industries,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to Miller Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them.
Towing and Recovery Equipment
We offer a broad range of towing and recovery equipment products that meet most customer design, capacity and cost requirements. We manufacture the bodies of wreckers and car carriers, which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties. We frequently purchase the truck chassis for integration with our towing and recovery equipment and resale to our customers. Wreckers generally are used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with rotating hydraulic booms and up to 100-ton lifting capacities. Car carriers are specialized flatbed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport. Car carriers transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective over longer distances. We also manufacture vehicle transport trailers.
Our products primarily are sold through independent distributors that serve all 50 states, Canada and Mexico, and other foreign markets including Europe, the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, South America and Africa, and through prime contractors to governmental entities. Additionally, as a result of our ownership of Jige International S.A. in France and Boniface Engineering, Ltd. in the United Kingdom, we have substantial distribution capabilities in Europe. While most of our distributor agreements do not generally contain exclusivity provisions, management believes that more than 90% of our independent distributors do not offer products of any other towing and recovery equipment manufacturer, which we believe is a testament to their loyalty to our brands. In addition to selling our products to towing operators, our independent distributors provide them with parts and service. We also utilize sales representatives to inform prospective end-users about our current product lines in an effort to drive sales to independent distributors. Management believes the strength of our distribution network and the breadth and quality of our product offerings are two key advantages over our competitors.
Product Lines
We manufacture a broad line of wrecker, car carrier and trailer bodies to meet a full range of customer design, capacity and cost requirements.
Wreckers. Wreckers are generally used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with up to 100-ton lifting capacities. Wreckers are available with specialized features, including underlifts, L-arms, crossbars and scoops, which lift disabled vehicles by the tires or front axle to minimize front end damage to the towed vehicles. Certain heavy-duty wrecker models offer rotating booms, which allow heavy-duty wreckers to recover vehicles from any angle, and remote-control devices for recovery equipment. In addition, certain light-duty wreckers are equipped with automatic wheel-lift hookup devices that allow operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the wrecker.
Our wreckers range in capacity from 4 to 100 tons, and are classified as either light-duty or heavy-duty, with wreckers of 16-ton or greater capacity being classified as heavy-duty. Light-duty wreckers are used to remove vehicles from accident scenes and vehicles illegally parked, abandoned or disabled, and for general recovery. Heavy-duty wreckers are used in towing and recovery applications including overturned tractor trailers, buses, motor homes and other large vehicles.

Car Carriers. Car carriers are specialized flat-bed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport. Car carriers are used to transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective for transporting vehicles or other equipment over longer distances. In addition to transporting vehicles, car carriers may also be used for other purposes, including transportation of industrial equipment. Most professional towing operators have car carriers in their fleets to complement their towing capabilities.
Transport Trailers. Our multi-vehicle transport trailers are specialized auto transport trailers with upper and lower decks and hydraulic ramps for loading vehicles. These trailers are used for moving multiple vehicles for auto auctions, car dealerships, leasing companies and other similar applications. These trailers are easy to load and transport 6 to 7 vehicles. The vehicles can be secured to transport quickly with ratchet and chain tie-downs that are mounted throughout the frame of the transport trailer. Many professional towing operators have added auto transport trailers to their fleets to add to their service offerings.
Brand Names
We manufacture and market our wreckers, car carriers and trailers under ten separate brand names. Although certain brands overlap in terms of features, prices and distributors, each brand has its own distinctive image and customer base.
Century®. The Century® brand is our “top-of-the-line” brand and represents what management believes to be the broadest product line in the industry. The Century® line was started in 1974 and produces wreckers ranging from 8-ton light-duty to 100-ton heavy-duty models, and car carriers in lengths from 20 to 30 feet. Management believes that the Century® brand has a reputation as the industry’s leading product innovator.
Vulcan®. Our Vulcan® product line includes a range of premium light-duty and heavy-duty wreckers, ranging from 8-ton light-duty to 75-ton heavy-duty models, and car carriers.
Challenger®. Our Challenger® products compete with the Century® and Vulcan® products and constitute a third premium product line. Challenger® products consist of heavy-duty wreckers with capacities ranging from 25 to 75 tons. The Challenger® line was started in 1975 and is known for high-performance heavy-duty wreckers and aesthetic design.
Holmes®. Our Holmes® product line includes mid-priced wreckers with 4 to 16-ton capacities, a 16-ton rotator and a detachable towing unit (DTU). The Holmes® wrecker was first produced in 1916. Historically, the Holmes® name has been the most well-recognized and leading industry brand both domestically and internationally.
Champion®. The Champion® brand, which was introduced in 1991, includes car carriers which range in length from 19 to 21 feet. The Champion® product line, which is generally lower-priced, allows us to offer a full line of car carriers at various competitive price points.
Chevron™. Our Chevron™ product line is comprised primarily of premium car carriers. Chevron™ produces a range of premium single-car, multi-car and industrial carriers, as well as wreckers ranging from 8-ton to 16-ton models.
Eagle®. Our Eagle® products consist of light-duty wreckers with the “Eagle Claw®” hook-up system that allows towing operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the tow truck. The “Eagle Claw®” hook-up system was originally developed for the repossession market. Since acquiring Eagle, we have upgraded the quality and features of the Eagle® product line and expanded its recovery capability.
Titan®. Our Titan® product line is comprised of premium multi-vehicle transport trailers which can transport up to 7 vehicles depending on configuration.
Jige™. Our Jige™ product line is comprised of a broad line of premium light-duty and heavy-duty wreckers and car carriers marketed primarily in Europe.

Product Development and Manufacturing
Product Innovation and Manufacturing Process Improvements
We have a long history of innovation in our products and manufacturing processes based on advanced technologies. Our Holmes® and Century® brand names are associated with four of the major innovations in the industry: the rapid reverse winch; the tow sling; the hydraulic lifting mechanism; and the underlift with parallel linkage and L-arms. Our engineering department currently consists of over 55 engineers who, in consultation with manufacturing personnel, use sophisticated computer-aided design and stress analysis systems to test new product designs and to integrate various product improvements. In addition to licensing new technologies, we have a continuing emphasis on research and development to achieve product innovations. At our free-standing research and development (R&D) facility in Chattanooga, Tennessee, we are pursuing innovations in our products and improvements in our manufacturing processes, some of which are intended to enhance the safety of our employees and towing equipment operators and reduce the environmental impact of both our manufacturing processes and the products we manufacture. These efforts led to our exclusive product, the M100, which we believe to be the world’s largest tow truck.
We manufacture wreckers, car carriers and trailers at six manufacturing facilities located in the United States, France and the United Kingdom. The manufacturing process for our products consists primarily of cutting and bending sheet steel or aluminum into parts that are welded together to form the wrecker, car carrier body or trailer. In addition, we also produce wrecker bodies using composites and other non-metallic materials, which reduces the overall vehicle weight and increases fuel efficiency. After the frame is formed, components such as hydraulic cylinders, winches, valves and pumps, which are purchased by us from third-party suppliers, are attached to the frame to form the completed wrecker or car carrier body. The completed body is either installed by us or shipped by common carrier to a distributor where it is then installed on a truck chassis. Generally, the wrecker or car carrier bodies are painted, and towing operators can select customized colors to coordinate with chassis colors or customer fleet colors. To the extent final painting is required before delivery, we either complete such painting or contract with independent paint shops for such services.
Recent Expansion and Modernization of Domestic Production Facilities
All of our domestic facilities have undergone substantial expansion and modernization projects from 2017 to 2021. During that five-year period, we invested over $82 million on property, plant and equipment. These projects not only increased our production capacity, but also included installing sophisticated robotics and implementing other advanced technologies to optimize our manufacturing process, enhance the safety of our employees and towing equipment operators and to reduce the environmental impacts of our operations.
Reducing the Environmental Impacts of our Domestic Production Facilities
​
We strive to conduct our operations in a manner that protects our employees, to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and to reduce the environmental impacts of our operations. The recent modernization projects at our domestic facilities included many environment-friendly upgrades, such as the installation of air filtration equipment that removes airborne contaminants like smoke, dust, pollen and dander to improve the air quality at the facilities. As part of these projects, we also transitioned from oil-based primers to water-based primers in our domestic painting operations, to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions into the environment and make our workplace safer for our employees. At the same time, we upgraded the lighting at all of our domestic production facilities to LED lighting, which has the benefit of reducing electric consumption while also increasing visibility for our employees. In 2022, we acquired a nitrogen generator to support our operations, which has the effect of reducing the environmental impacts of transporting nitrogen gas to our domestic facilities. We continue to look for new ways to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly practices at our production facilities to reduce energy-usage, increase recycling and decrease waste.
Company Suppliers
We purchase raw materials and component parts from several sources. Although we have no long-term supply contracts, management believes we have good relationships with our primary suppliers. In recent years prices have fluctuated significantly, and supply chain challenges have been severe. Prior to these recent challenges, we generally experienced no significant problems in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts to meet the requirements of our production schedules, and found that the materials used in the production of our products were available at competitive prices from an adequate number of alternative suppliers. However, recent supply chain challenges have made us more concerned that the loss of a single supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business. Supply 

5



chain challenges generally lessened in the second half of 2022, but these challenges are expected to continue to affect our ability to complete finished goods in a timely manner and to impact our costs of operations.
Sales, Distribution and Marketing
The industry categorizes the towing and recovery market into three general product types: light-duty wreckers; heavy-duty wreckers; and car carriers. The light-duty wrecker market consists primarily of professional wrecker operators, repossession towing services, local and national governmental entities and repair shop or salvage company owners. The heavy-duty market includes professional wrecker operators serving the needs of commercial vehicle operators as well as governmental entities. The car carrier market has expanded to include equipment rental companies that offer delivery service and professional towing operators who desire to complement their existing towing capabilities.
We sell our products to a diverse network of independent distributors, consisting of approximately 80 distributors in North America, who serve all 50 states, Canada and Mexico, and numerous distributors that serve other foreign markets. These distributors then sell our products to the end-users
Our distributor network has been stable for many years, with a large majority of our distributors having been engaged to sell our products for more than 10 years, and many for more than 25 years.  We believe this distributor loyalty results primarily from our high quality and innovative products and our emphasis on customer service. These long-standing relations give our distributors a deep knowledge of our products and our corporate culture, allowing them to effectively promote our products to end-users.  While we do not impose exclusivity requirements on our distributors, we believe that more than 90% of our independent distributors do not offer products of any other towing and recovery equipment manufacturer, which we believe is a testament to their loyalty to our brands. 
In 2022, one distributor accounted for 11.2% of our consolidated total sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated total sales and we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any single customer. Management believes that our broad and diverse network of distributors provides us with the flexibility to adapt to market changes, lessens our dependence on particular distributors and reduces the impact of regional economic factors.
We engage sales representatives who provide sales support to our entire network of independent distributors. Sales representatives receive commissions on direct sales based on product type and brand and generally are assigned specific territories in which to promote sales of our products and to maintain customer relationships. To support sales and marketing efforts, we produce demonstrator models that are used by our sales representatives and independent distributors. In addition to providing services to our network of independent distributors, our sales representatives sell our products to various governmental entities, including the U.S. federal government and foreign governments, through prime contractors.
We routinely respond to requests for proposals or bid invitations in consultation with our local distributors. Our products have been selected by the United States General Services Administration as an approved source for certain federal and defense agencies. We intend to continue to pursue federal, state and local government and foreign government contracting opportunities.
The towing and recovery equipment industry places heavy marketing emphasis on product exhibitions at national, regional and international trade shows. To focus our marketing efforts and to control marketing costs at major trade shows each year, we work with our network of independent distributors to concentrate on various regional shows. 
Product Warranties and Insurance
We generally offer a 12-month limited manufacturer’s product and service warranty on our wrecker and car carrier products. Our warranty generally provides for repair or replacement of failed parts or components. Our independent distributor customers regularly perform any needed warranty repair work themselves, rather than shipping products back to us, and then invoice us for the cost of the parts and labor. Management believes that we maintain adequate general liability and product liability insurance.
Backlog
We produce virtually all of our products to order. Our backlog is based upon customer purchase orders that we believe are firm. The level of backlog at any particular time, however, may not be an appropriate indicator of our future operating performance. Certain 

6



purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer upon notification. As a result of the lingering impacts of the supply chain disruptions that began in fiscal 2021, our current backlog is at historically high levels of orders. Our ability to reduce these high backlog levels will depend on future production schedules and the severity and duration of supply chain disruptions.
Competition
The towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive for sales to distributors and towing operators. Management believes that competition in our industry focuses on product quality and innovation, reputation, technology, customer service, product availability and price. We compete on the basis of each of these criteria, with an emphasis on product quality and innovation and customer service. Management also believes that a manufacturer’s relationship with distributors is a key component of success in the industry. Accordingly, we have invested substantial resources and management time in building and maintaining strong relationships with distributors. Management also believes that our products are regarded as high quality within their particular price points. Our marketing strategy is to continue to compete primarily on the basis of quality and reputation rather than solely on the basis of price, and to continue to target the growing group of professional towing operators who as end-users recognize the quality of our products.
Traditionally, the capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low. Management believes a manufacturer’s capital resources and access to technological improvements have become a more integral component of success in recent years. Certain of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than we do.
Human Capital
We employed approximately 1,450 people as of December 31, 2022. Part-time employees represent 1% of our total employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, though our employees in France and the United Kingdom have certain similar rights provided by their respective government’s employment regulations. We consider our employee relations to be good. 
Our Company culture is based on treating others the way we would like to be treated and we strive to foster a work environment that is inclusive, diverse, fair and engaged. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is intended to reinforce our core values of respect, integrity, collaboration, innovation, trust, and excellence throughout our operations.
During fiscal 2022, we experienced substantially increased employee turnover rates in our skilled workforce and in response have taken various actions to attract and retain skilled laborers, including attending hiring events, broadening our recruitment platforms, paying sign-on and retention bonuses, offering enhanced wages, and providing training programs. Our key recruitment and retention strategies are also advanced through the following programs, policies and initiatives:
Employee Development/Training
​
To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we provide training programs that address skills shortages in our workforce, foster career development, and encourage proper use of technology and resources. These include our Welding School that teaches employees how to read blueprints, interpret weld symbols, and learn welding technique. In addition, Miller University One and Two were created to develop high potential employees for future leadership roles in the company, and provide change management, decision making, and problem-solving skills to future leaders of our Company. We have also established a tuition reimbursement program for continuing education, including undergraduate and graduate degrees or certifications and licenses relevant to the business.
Competitive Pay and Employee Benefits
​
We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives, competitive compensation packages and fair compensation practices. For example, we periodically perform compensation studies to ensure competitive pay rates for our employees. In addition, we provide a variety of benefits including but not limited to comprehensive medical coverage, short-term and long-term disability, life insurance, wellness screening, dental coverage, paid time off incentive programs, an employee assistance program, access to telehealth services, and a U.S. 401(k) plan with a Company match.

Occupational Health and Safety
​
We seek to provide a healthy and safe workplace. The modernization projects at all our domestic facilities in the last few years included many advanced health and safety features, such as the installation of air filtration equipment that removes airborne contaminants like smoke, dust, pollen and dander to improve the air quality at our production facilities. As part of these projects and upgrades, we also transitioned from oil-based primers to water-based primers in our domestic painting operations to reduce total volatile organic compounds emissions and make our workplace safer for our employees. We also upgraded the lighting at our facilities to LED lighting, which has the benefit of reducing electric consumption while also increasing visibility for our employees. We have a safety committee to implement and monitor our various safety programs. We are continually striving to better our workplace safety record and our five-year trend on workplace accidents reflects substantial improvement in this area. We are committed to fostering a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment. 
The spread of the COVID-19 virus has led to unique challenges, and we are striving to ensure the health, safety and general well-being of our employees. We have made and continue to make what we believe to be appropriate modifications to our operations because of COVID-19 to allow us to protect our employees while operating all our facilities consistent with applicable governmental guidelines and orders. 
Employee Engagement 
​
The Company’s management team promotes an “open door” environment in which all feedback and suggestions are welcome. We have invested substantial time and resources in recent years to optimize the engagement, productivity and safety of our workforce, which we believe is the foundation upon which we can maintain our competitive advantages in product quality and customer service. For example, we hired an employee engagement specialist who is dedicated to communicating with our employees. We also actively monitor the satisfaction and engagement of our workforce, including through periodic employee surveys conducted by third-party experts. 
Intellectual Property Rights
Our development of the underlift parallel linkage and L-arms was at the time considered one of the most innovative developments in the wrecker industry. This technology continues to be significant primarily because it allows the damage-free towing of aerodynamic vehicles made of lighter weight materials. This technology, particularly the L-arms, is still used in a majority of commercial wreckers today. Our patents on the L-arms have expired, but we hold a number of utility and design patents for our products. We have also obtained the rights to use and develop certain technologies owned or patented by others. Management believes that, during the life of our patents on our technology, utilizing our patented technology without a license would be an infringement of such patents.
Our trademarks “M®” (stylized), “Miller Industries®” (with stylized “M”), “Century®,” “Holmes®,” “Champion®,” “Challenger®,” “Pro Star®,” “Street Runner®,” “Vulcan®,” “Right Approach®” and “Extreme Angle®,” among others, are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Management believes that our trademarks are well-recognized by dealers, distributors and end-users in their respective markets and are associated with a high level of quality and value.
Government Regulations and Environmental Matters
We strive to manufacture our products in a way that minimizes environmental impact and maximizes worker health and safety. Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and health and safety, including laws and regulations governing the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with these numerous and sometimes complex federal, state and local laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental protection laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past, but we may be subject to other more stringent environmental laws in the future. Our facilities and operations could also be subject to regulations related to climate change and climate change itself may also have some impact on the Company’s operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain, and the Company cannot presently predict the nature and scope of those impacts.
We act as a subcontractor for certain U.S. and other government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. and other government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs.

8



We are also subject to various federal, state and non-U.S. laws and regulations related to privacy, data protection and cybersecurity, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"), and U.S. state laws such as California’s Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. These state laws require an information security program based on an ongoing risk assessment, overseeing third-party service providers, investigating data breaches and notifying regulators of a cybersecurity event. The GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 grant individuals the right to request that a company delete or de-identify their personal information. There is a strong possibility that other states, including states in which we transact our business, enact their own data security regulations and privacy laws. We do not expect compliance with the various data security or data privacy acts to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
We are also subject to the additional diligence and disclosure requirements adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The SEC rules impose these obligations with respect to “conflict minerals,” defined as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, which are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. If any “conflict minerals” that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured by an SEC reporting company originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country, the rules require the issuer to prepare and file a report addressing its efforts to exercise due diligence on the source of such “conflict minerals” and their chain of custody. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union adopted new requirements for European Union importers of conflict minerals, which went into effect on January 1, 2021, and that may impact and increase the cost of our conflict minerals compliance program.
We are also subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act which regulates the description of warranties on products. The description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of vehicle components. Management believes that continued compliance with various government regulations will not materially affect our operations.
