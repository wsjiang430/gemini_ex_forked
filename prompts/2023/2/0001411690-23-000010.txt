ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a global genomics company focused on elevating the health and wellness of all people. We are pioneers of optical genome mapping (OGM) for genome analysis and provide a suite of genome analysis solutions designed to enable researchers and clinicians to reveal answers to challenging questions in biology and medicine. Our mission is to transform the way the world sees the genome. Through our OGM solutions, our nucleic acid isolation and purification solutions, our genomic analysis and interpretation software, and our clinical testing and laboratory services, we believe that we have a suite of products that will drive new discoveries, elevate health and wellness, and increase our understanding of the genome in transformative ways.
We market and sell the Saphyr® system, which delivers OGM data to enable ultra-sensitive and ultra-specific detection of all classes of structural variation (SV). The Saphyr system is used to identify structural changes in chromosomes, known as cytogenetics, and to accelerate the search for answers in genetic disease and cancer applications. The Saphyr system is comprised of an instrument, chip consumables, reagents and software containing a suite of data analysis and visualization tools. The Saphyr system has been shown to outperform the current gold standard methods for cytogenetics and molecular genetics including karyotyping, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blot and chromosomal microarray (CMA). The Saphyr system has also been shown to identify structural changes in chromosomes that cannot be identified using current commercially available solutions for gene sequencing.
We market and sell the Ionic® Purification system, which is able to deliver high quality DNA in a more natural, native form and with fewer contaminants when compared to other isolation and purifications solutions. The Ionic Purification system is used to extract, purify, and concentrate DNA or RNA from a variety of sample types, and is comprised of an instrument, consumables, and reagents. 
Our software delivers genomic data interpretation solutions tailored for research use in cytogenomics and molecular pathology labs in genetic disease and cancer research markets, with an emphasis on structural variation. This industry leading, platform agnostic software solution is designed to provide analysis, visualization, interpretation and reporting of SVs, single-nucleotide variants and absence of heterozygosity across the genome in one consolidated view. Our software currently enables analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microarray data, and we are developing a version that we expect to be able to incorporate OGM data to make our software a more comprehensive offering for analysis of genomic data. We believe the integration of OGM with data types common in the industry, such as Variant Call Format (VCF), and Binary Alignment Map (BAM), should accelerate and broaden our position in digital cytogenetics and comprehensive genome analysis by enabling us to simplify the assessment of clinically relevant variants in cytogenomics applications, potentially reducing interpretation time per sample and expanding our reach into the discovery and translational research markets through the combination of OGM and NGS.
Our Bionano Laboratories business provides proprietary genetic clinical testing services for individuals demonstrating clinical presentations consistent with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and other disorders of childhood development. Their comprehensive genetic testing services include reporting for known NDD-causing genome variations, including testing for proprietary variations, and combines testing with our Proprietary Variant Index (PRISM) which uses a proprietary database of over 35,000 individuals with NDDs tested with over 60,000 tests that provides additional evidence for candidate genes associated with NDDs. This testing is a CLIA-certified diagnostic testing service, and we have expertise in selling cytogenetic assays to physicians, providing genetic counseling services to individuals undergoing testing and their families, and contracting with third-party payors for reimbursement. Additionally, Bionano Laboratories has developed OGM-based laboratory developed tests (LDTs) for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1), which is a progressive disorder that primarily affects the muscles of the face, shoulder blades (scapula), upper arms, and lower legs, and for detecting SVs in individuals with hematologic malignancies. 
Bionano Laboratories also provides laboratory services to clinicians, scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and others who are seeking to incorporate OGM into their genomics research without the need to bring our Saphyr system in house. Laboratory services for OGM are performed in our laboratory facilities in San Diego, California and at partner laboratories in the United States and Europe, and serve as solutions for researchers and clinicians who would like to use OGM for various applications in genomics but have yet to acquire the Saphyr system.
Over the past year, we believe we have transformed our business from an instrument company to a provider of a full suite of genomic solutions. We expanded into molecular genetic clinical testing services through our August 2020 acquisition of Lineagen. We furthered our transformation through the expansion into software solutions, made possible by our October 2021 acquisition of BioDiscovery and continued with our November 2022 acquisition of Purigen bringing their leading nucleic acid isolation and purification technology to Bionano. We believe that these acquisitions, along with internal investments in research and development and the build out of our commercial teams, have positioned us well to provide solutions to our customers that we believe will make OGM the standard of care for many constitutional genetic disorders and cancers.

Continued to Validate the Utility of OGM for Applications in Clinical Research with Benchmarking, Scientific Publication and Adoption
Rigorous and extensive benchmarking of our Saphyr system against traditional cytogenetic methods and long read sequencing has continued and these results were published and validated in several key publications, presentations and announcements including:
•Researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center published the first study to evaluate the utility of OGM for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) prognostication. The publication reported that when OGM was used instead of karyotyping, 17 to 21% of study subjects had different prognostic risk scores depending on the scoring system used, and in 13% of study subjects additional pathogenic variants were revealed.
•In a study published in Blood Cancer Journal, researchers found that in 33% of MDS samples and 54% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, more clinically relevant variants were detected using OGM than were found by traditional cytogenetic methods and these variants were reported to be highly relevant to the understanding of pathogenesis of these disorders.
•Researchers from eight research institutes analyzed OGM’s utility for detection of cytogenetic abnormalities in AML samples, finding that OGM identified pathogenic variants in 12% of cases that altered European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk-level or identified eligibility for clinical trials. 
•The first published validation study to evaluate the performance of OGM versus traditional cytogenetic techniques for the analysis of hematological neoplasms showed that OGM’s technical performance resulted in a 100% first-pass rate, with concordance to traditional methods showing a sensitivity of 98.7%, a specificity of 100%, and an accuracy of 99.2%. 
•A study demonstrated the utility of OGM as part of a workflow to evaluate the quality of hypoimmunogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which could be used in regenerative medicine. This research provides scientific and practical support for OGM’s ability to detect cryptic and balanced SVs in CRISPR-edited cells, some of which were not detected by karyotyping, and which may impact the genomic integrity of iPSCs.

Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Developments
We are subject to additional risks and uncertainties as a result of adverse geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, such as any lingering effects of COVID-19, the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia and related sanctions, and uncertain market conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, which could continue to have a material impact on our business and financial results. 
For a more detailed discussion of the impacts of macroeconomic and geopolitical developments on our business, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Developments.”
Industry Background 
Genome analysis is the process of extracting and interpreting biological information from DNA and RNA. DNA is the code that is found in all living cells and determines the characteristics and health of all living organisms. Although each organism’s DNA order is unique, all DNA is composed of the same four nucleotides that come in pairs, which are referred to as base pairs. The human genome is composed of six billion of these base pairs (three billion of which are the maternal copy and three billion of which are the paternal copy of the genome), distributed across 23 pairs of chromosomes ranging in size from approximately 50 million to approximately 250 million base pairs. Genome variation is defined as at least one base pair differing in a comparison of sequence against a reference standard and can be as large as tens of millions of base pairs. 
Genome structure refers to the way in which the various functional elements of the genome such as genes, reading frames, promoters and others are ordered, oriented and organized across the 23 pairs of chromosomes. SVs represent differences in the amount or location of genomic DNA from one individual compared to a reference genome. SV is one of the most biologically important aspects of the human genome and is a major factor for the cause of genetic disorders and cancer. Each SV involves the rearrangement or repetition of as few as several hundred base pairs to as many as tens of millions of base pairs. SVs may be inherited or arise spontaneously. SVs are well-known to cause diseases such as constitutional genetic disorders and cancer. Many researchers and clinicians now agree that despite major advances in the speed and cost-effectiveness of DNA sequencing, it fails to reliably detect SVs. OGM enables the detection of all known classes of SVs, and we believe no methodology exists that can detect SVs more comprehensively or cost efficiently than OGM with the Saphyr system.
We believe the traditional cytogenomic methods of detecting SVs for research and clinical applications, such as karyotyping, CMA, and FISH are antiquated and cumbersome and can only detect a small proportion of the SVs across an entire genome. OGM is designed to offer cytogeneticists the ability to fully digitize and replace these traditional methods with one simplified, cost effective and scalable workflow using the Saphyr system. 
We believe that DNA isolation is the critical first step in the analysis of DNA. Short and long read sequencing applications typically require nucleotide lengths of 150 and, generally, 10,000 to 20,000 base pairs, respectively. OGM, conversely, optimally requires DNA lengths of greater than 100,000 base pairs. Due to market needs, the vast majority of DNA isolation and preparation technologies have been directed to meeting the requirements for short and long read sequencing applications. We believe that DNA isolation and purification processes that allow long segments of DNA (ultra-high molecular weight (UHMW) DNA) to remain intact are important for the success of OGM. Our Ionic Purification system has the capability to isolate and purify UHMW DNA that is ideal for OGM applications. We believe that the system’s ease of use, reproducibility, and cost per sample profile has the potential to accelerate the adoption of OGM across a broad spectrum of applications. 
We believe that software is necessary for genome analysis and should be the primary interface for how cytogeneticists interact with the data and report their findings. We believe the software’s ease of use, core analysis functionality and the time necessary to obtain a reportable result are the most important factors to customers when considering a platform adoption decision and that data interpretation is typically a critical bottleneck in methods of genome analysis and therefore software is a key component in the entire workflow. The majority of software solutions on the market today have been developed with NGS as the primary application with the focus on the interpretation and reporting of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) instead of SVs. Our software solution, NxClinical™, was developed with CNV as the core focus and has become established as an industry leading solution for interpretation and reporting of CNVs for CMA and NGS. To the extent we are successful in integrating OGM into our NxClinical software, we anticipate that our software will be the first software solution delivering a fully integrated interpretation capability for SVs from OGM as well as seamless integration with NGS, with the potential to enable complementary OGM and NGS workflows through one software solution. 
Our Solutions
We believe that an end-to-end OGM solution begins with the sample and ends with data analysis. The OGM workflow includes several steps: DNA isolation, DNA labeling, DNA mapping, data processing and data analysis. At each step we have either organically developed a solution or partnered with a third party to enable and provide a solution. We highly value our relationships with third parties that enable us to provide these solutions and will continue to work with others to ensure our customers’ needs are being met. We are constantly on the look-out for opportunities to better meet the needs of our customers

whether that is through partnerships, organic development, or strategic acquisitions that accelerate and up-shift our capabilities. To that end, we have recently engaged in two transactions, which we believe will substantially benefit our customers and their adoption of OGM as a solution of choice for SV and CNV analysis. In 2021 we acquired BioDiscovery and its leading NxClinical software for data analysis, and in 2022 we acquired Purigen, and its proprietary isolation and purification technology. We believe that each of these acquisitions, together with our organic development, will significantly enhance the customer experience with OGM.
OGM Systems
Our system uses a proprietary approach to measure genome structure and SV through OGM. The OGM workflow is novel, comprehensive, scalable, cost effective and highly differentiated. OGM data is currently generated using the Saphyr system, which directly measures sequence specific patterns (SSPs) along UHMW DNA molecules in an unbiased approach without any amplification. Using the SSPs, software constructs a detailed physical map of the genome that accurately assigns the chromosomal location, order, orientation and quantity of sequence and in-turn, all the genome’s functional elements. We believe OGM is capable of comprehensive, cost-effective and efficient detection of all classes of SVs and CNVs. Today, these SVs cannot be reliably detected by genome sequencing, from existing high throughput sequencers, which is focused on identifying genomic differences involving a few base pairs or SNVs, which the Saphyr system does not identify. We believe the Saphyr system is ideally suited to be adopted alongside the installed base of high throughput sequencers as a complement that is designed to give users the ability to see a much wider scope of genome variation, from single bases of DNA to full chromosomes. 
OGM was built upon four key elements: 
•Extremely long molecules for analysis (or UHMW DNA). The Saphyr system is capable of analyzing single molecules that are on average approximately 250,000 base pairs in length and can be as long as millions of base pairs. These lengths are over 1,000 times longer than the average short read length with Illumina sequencing systems and approximately 10-20 times longer than the average long read lengths with Pacific Biosciences of California (PacBio), and Oxford Nanopore systems. We believe these long read lengths overcome the inherent challenges of genome complexity and are the key to the Saphyr system’s unprecedented sensitivity and specificity.
•Proprietary nanotechnology for massively parallel linearization and analysis of long molecules with single molecule imaging. Analyzing UHMW DNA required invention. We invented, patented, developed and commercialized nanochannel arrays to capture long single molecules of DNA from a solution and unwind and linearize them for SV analysis. Each molecule is imaged separately, making it possible to deconvolute complex mixtures including haplotypes and heterogeneous tumors.
•DNA labeling chemistry specifically for physical mapping. The detailed analysis of SSPs we use is also highly unique and novel. Instead of identifying the sequence of every base pair in these long fragments, we label and detect SSPs or motifs that occur universally across every genome with an average frequency of approximately one site for every few thousand base pairs. The key to our method entails introducing fluorescent tags at the sequence-specific site using highly specific and robust enzymatic chemistry along the extremely long fragments. These fragments, stretched out in nanochannels, are then directly imaged allowing us to measure the distance between labels with high accuracy. The pattern of labels detected on all these fragments can then be related to the pattern of sequence motif sites in a reference genome for comparison. Changes in the pattern indicate structural variation. 
•Bioinformatic tools for SV analysis. Finally, our approach includes a novel bioinformatics platform that we developed from the ground-up to take advantage of the unique benefits of our solution. It comprises proprietary algorithms for the construction of a structurally accurate physical map of the genome to assign structure. Physical

maps of a test subject are then compared to a reference or other subjects in cross-mapping analysis that allows our system to detect genome wide SV, including the most complex balanced events. 
The Saphyr system provides a solution for comprehensive SV analysis at a higher resolution than traditional techniques allowing for more answers that matter to be obtained in genetic disease and cancer applications. We believe that the Saphyr system is the only product capable of detecting SVs at high sensitivity and specificity with a workflow that is cost-effective and time efficient. 
Our customers include researchers and clinicians who seek to identify and understand the biological implications of genome variation. We believe that the Saphyr system can replace more traditional cytogenetic tools which are expensive, slow and labor-intense, with an advanced solution designed to simplify workflow, reduce cost, and increase assay success rates. We believe the Saphyr system has the potential to significantly increase success rates and provide more answers across a wide range of applications in genomics.
Nucleic Acid Isolation and Purification Systems
Our nucleic acid isolation and purification system uses a novel and proprietary application of isotachophoresis (ITP) to isolate nucleic acid molecules in a gentle and efficient process. The process involves the gentle lysis of biological samples followed by the addition of the sample and buffer to an Ionic® fluid chip. An electric field is applied to the chip and the nucleic acid is isolated in its natural, native form. Traditional methods of isolating nucleic acid, including column-based isolation and bead-based isolation, can be laborious, and result in molecules that are denatured, dehydrated and fragmented, and solutions that are contaminated and have low purity. An additional limitation of many of the traditional isolation processes is the number of cells that are required to be processed in order to obtain sufficient nucleic acid molecules for OGM analysis. Current methodologies require upwards of 1.5 million cells in order to isolate sufficient DNA for use on the Saphyr system. Our Ionic Purification system, employing ITP technology, addresses many of these deficiencies and yields high purity nucleic acid that is not denatured, dehydrated or fragmented. Additionally, the Ionic Purification system is capable of isolating sufficient quantities of DNA for use in OGM applications from far fewer cells in contrast to traditional methods. We believe the addition of the Ionic Purification system to the OGM workflow will provide a more efficient yield of DNA at higher quality than can be achieved with current processes. 
Although OGM is our primary focus, the Ionic Purification system has a current customer base of non-OGM users that use the system to isolate and purify nucleic acid molecules from sample types including formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sample, tissue, cells, and viral. We anticipate continuing to support and expanding this customer base. 
Software Solutions
We offer industry leading genome analysis software that enables genomics labs to analyze and interpret data across a wide range of platforms to generate highly informative data visualizations for streamlined and simple reporting of causal variants. Today, NxClinical software is among the most comprehensive solutions for analysis and interpretation of any microarray or NGS generated data integrating CNVs, absence of heterozygosity (AOH) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), as well as SNVs from sequencing data into a single well integrated interface that is used across the globe by renowned academic and commercial clinical laboratories. 
Our acquisition of BioDiscovery has expanded our portfolio into providing data analysis and interpretation solutions across NGS, CMA and we are working to add OGM. These software solutions are expected to allow us to leverage and expand our network of Bionano customers and to potentially enable future adoption of OGM. We believe integrating OGM data into the NxClinical software should substantially improve the analysis and reporting capabilities of our current Saphyr system, making OGM easier to adopt and use by our customers. Through BioDiscovery, we can now serve the NGS and array markets directly though software with an industry leading data interpretation solution for revealing more answers with delivery of copy number variants across the genome. Our software monetization strategy is predicated on a pay-per-sample model where customers running NGS and/or array today can adopt, which sets the stage for future OGM adoptions. Software is a way for us to participate directly in the NGS market while also enabling OGM data to be seamlessly integrated with NGS in one view for a comprehensive analysis, which is unique to Bionano.
Testing and Laboratory Services
Our Bionano Laboratories business offers tests that use CMA for evaluation of patients suspected of having certain genetic diseases, which is recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), among other renowned societies. We are actively performing research to determine whether OGM with the Saphyr system can replace CMA as the front-line test for children with developmental disorders. As the scientific, peer-reviewed literature supports this claim, the coding entities such as CMS and the AMA would need to adopt the proper procedural codes to allow for insurance reimbursement of new testing methodologies before they become mainstream clinical diagnostic instruments. Importantly, OGM is expected to be able to detect full mutations consistent with fragile X syndrome, which is another front-line test for children, especially males, with 
Table of Contents

autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Studies are ongoing to determine the sensitivity and specificity for OGM as it relates to fragile X syndrome. Bionano Laboratories also employs Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), which aims to detect genome SNVs that are different from genome SVs and are not detectable by OGM. 
We believe that Bionano Laboratories is uniquely positioned to develop LDT’s that can improve upon the existing SOC for diagnostic testing for NDDs. Bionano Laboratories is working with payers to secure reimbursement alternatives for OGM-based testing. If reimbursements can be established, Bionano Laboratories intends to share its strategies with other labs which may drive demand for the Saphyr system. Bionano Laboratories plans to expand its testing menu with inclusion of OGM to demonstrate workflow implementation in a clinical setting in order to drive adoption as well as serve as a conduit for enabling access for those customers unable to make a capital equipment expenditure. Bionano Laboratories is working to enable access, demonstrate excellence of the OGM workflow as a model within a CLIA setting for educational purposes, and drive advancements in product development for clinical grade testing of OGM at scale.
Our Commercial Offerings 
The Saphyr System and Consumables
We develop and market the Saphyr system, a complete sample-to-result solution for SV analysis by OGM that empowers comprehensive genome analysis and facilitates a deeper understanding of genetic variation and function. We believe the Saphyr system is capable of addressing the needs for SV analysis because it is:
•Highly sensitive. We believe Saphyr is the most sensitive detector of SV larger than 500 base pairs currently on the market.
•Cost effective. The consumables cost per genome, at an average of approximately $500, can be less than the combination of standard techniques and well below both short-read and long-read WGS at a depth of 160x coverage. 
•Scalable and fast. Relative to traditional techniques, Saphyr has demonstrated up to a 75% reduction in turnaround time for analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) subjects when used instead of karyotyping, FISH and MLPA.
The Saphyr Instrument 
The Saphyr instrument is a single-molecule imager that includes high performance optics, automated sample loading based on machine learning algorithms and computational hardware and control software. The instrument’s high-performance optics simultaneously image DNA linearized in hundreds of thousands of nanochannels. The instrument’s control interface is the user’s primary control center to design and monitor experiments as they occur in real time. The computational hardware is responsible for the secondary processing of the image data being produced on the Saphyr instruments. The Saphyr instrument is currently capable of analyzing up to 5,000 human genomes per year at 30x coverage. At the end of 2022 we announced the placement of a pre-commercial unit that we expect to significantly increase the throughput. 
The Saphyr Chip 
The Saphyr Chip® is the consumable that packages the nanochannel arrays for DNA linearization. In its current form, each Saphyr chip has three flow cells containing approximately 120,000 nanochannels that are roughly 30 nanometers wide, and each flowcell can hold one unique sample. To manufacture the arrays, we use photolithography in a semiconductor fabrication facility to print hundreds of thousands of tiny grooves on silicon wafers and then dice the wafers into individual chips. Our chips are inexpensive to manufacture and highly scalable. The fluidic environment in each channel allows individual molecules to move swiftly utilizing only the charge of DNA. Hundreds of thousands of molecules can move through hundreds of thousands of parallel nanochannels simultaneously, enabling extremely high-throughput processing on a single-molecule basis.

Saphyr Sample Prep and Labeling Kits 
Our Bionano Prep™ kits and DNA labeling kits provide the reagents and protocols needed to extract and label UHMW DNA for use with the Saphyr system. These kits are optimized for performing our genome mapping applications on a variety of sample types.
Our workflow begins with the isolation of UHMW DNA. Our Bionano Prep kits are optimized for isolating and purifying UHMW DNA in a process that is gentler than existing DNA extraction methods. The resulting purified DNA is up to millions of base pairs long and optimal for use with our systems. Our kits and protocols enable the extraction of UHMW DNA from a variety of sample types including human or animal tissue and tumors, plant tissue, cell lines, bone marrow aspirates and human blood. 
Our labeling reagents are optimized for applications on our genome mapping systems. Starting with UHMW DNA purified using the appropriate Bionano Prep kit, fluorescent labels are attached to specific sequence motifs. The result is uniquely identifiable genome-specific label patterns that enable de novo map assembly, anchoring sequencing contigs and discovery of SVs as small as 500 base pairs to up to chromosome arm lengths. 
Our kit for DNA labeling, the Direct Label and Stain (DLS) kit, is a proprietary, nondestructive chemistry for sequence motif labeling of genomic DNA that improves every aspect of our genome mapping. DLS uses a single direct-labeling enzymatic reaction to attach a fluorophore to the DNA at a specific 6-base pair sequence motif, yielding approximately 16 labels per 100,000 base pairs in the human genome. After labeling, the molecules are linearized in the Saphyr chip on the Saphyr instrument and imaged. Through the isolation, labeling and linearization steps, the molecules maintain an average length of around 250,000 base pairs. The label patterns on each molecule allow them to be uniquely identified and aligned in a pair-wise comparison against all other molecules imaged from the same sample.
The Ionic Purification System
We acquired the Ionic Purification system through our November 2022 acquisition of Purigen. The Ionic Purification system uses a proprietary ITP method to isolate and purify nucleic acid molecules. The technology was initially developed at Stanford University and intellectual property from that development was exclusively licensed to Purigen. The technology was further developed and commercialized by Purigen. The system includes an instrument, consumable and reagents necessary to process samples. The system works by applying an electric field to specially formulated reagents in a consumable. The electric field electrophoretically focuses nucleic acid into a narrow band and purifies the molecules away from other potential inhibitors. This results in a higher yield of pure nucleic acid than traditional bind-and-strip approaches that is also less fragmented and free from bead or wash buffer contamination. 
We offer reagents to isolate DNA and RNA from FFPE, tissue, and cells. We are optimizing the system with the intent it be used in an OGM workflow. We believe that the isolation and purification of DNA using the Ionic system in an OGM workflow will create a number of opportunities, including, enabling additional sample types not currently available to OGM, increasing sample throughput, decreasing sample preparation complexity.

Software Solutions 
Our data solutions offering includes a complete suite of hardware and software for end-to-end experiment management, algorithms for assembling genome maps and algorithms and databases for bioinformatics processing, all of which is driven through convenient web-based management and monitoring tools. 
We have a suite of proprietary algorithms and databases that fully enable our proprietary bioinformatic and SV analysis pipelines. Using pairwise alignment of the single molecule images, consensus genome maps are constructed, refined, extended and merged. Molecules are then clustered into two alleles, and a diploid assembly is created to allow for heterozygous SV detection. Genome maps typically span entire chromosome arms in single, contiguous maps. Comparative analysis of maps reveals SV. Our customers use our variant annotation workflow to specifically uncover rare and sample-specific mutations. 
Our hardware solution includes the Saphyr Compute Server, which provides cluster-like performance in an affordable, compact solution and the Bionano Compute Server, which expands the analytical capacity of the suite of tools. With these solutions, our customers are capable of performing multiple simultaneous analyses and sustaining continuous throughput, which allows them to spend less time waiting for data, so they can focus on investigating results. We also offer a cloud-based solution for data analysis.
Our NxClinical software is among the most comprehensive and up-to-date solutions for cytogenetics and molecular genetics, providing one solution for analysis and interpretation of all genomic variants from microarray and NGS data. We are developing a version of NxClinical to incorporate OGM data, which is expected to become our software solution once completed.
Testing and Laboratory Services
Our Bionano Laboratories business offers OGM data to researchers seeking access to OGM data. Bionano Laboratories intends to build a menu of LDTs using OGM solutions, and in 2022 Bionano Laboratories introduced their first two OGM-based tests, one for hematological malignancy and another for genetic disorder applications. Additionally, Bionano Laboratories offers molecular genetic clinical testing services for individuals demonstrating clinical presentations consistent with NDDs, including ASDs and other disorders of childhood development, including: 
•FirstStepDx PLUS is a CMA designed to identify an underlying genetic cause in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and intellectual disability; 
•Fragile X syndrome (FXS) testing is designed to detect individuals (both males and females) with FXS, as well as carriers of the condition;
•NextStepDx PLUS is a whole exome sequencing test designed to identify genetic variants that are associated with disorders of childhood development; 
•EpiPanelDx PLUS is a genetic testing panel designed for patients who have experienced seizures, infantile spasms, encephalopathy, or febrile seizures; and
•PGx test identifies over 60 alleles in 11 genes. PGx testing is one aspect of personalized medicine and is used to aid health care providers with medications and dosage.
Market Opportunity 
According to Markets and Markets, the worldwide market for genomics products and services is expected to reach approximately $54.4 billion by 2025, up from approximately $22.7 billion in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate of 19%. 
We expect to see OGM adoption in cytogenomics, discovery research and cell bioprocessing quality control (QC). Within cytogenetics and molecular pathology, we estimate the number of cytogenetic labs on a worldwide basis (excluding India and 
Table of Contents

developing countries) to be approximately 10,000. We estimate that these labs analyze approximately 10.0 million samples per year. Additionally, we estimate the number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies that are engaged in research and development of various cell therapies that rely on methods, including cytogenetics, for QC of the cell modification and manufacturing process to be approximately 1,400. Based on these estimates, we believe the economic potential for OGM in these markets is approximately $10.0 billion annually, $3.0 billion of which we attribute to cell bioprocessing QC. We believe there are additional potential future market opportunities for OGM including newborn screening, population genomics, and neurological and cardiological risk assessment which are not included in our estimates above.
We believe the three areas of the genomics market that are driving demand for the Saphyr system today: 
•Consolidation of traditional cytogenetics techniques in constitutional and cancer applications. To provide a robust clinical analysis, cytogenetic assays detect known SVs that are linked to specific diseases or therapeutic responses. The technologies used for detecting SVs are expensive and involve cumbersome workflows with relatively limited ability to scale to higher volumes or more complex testing panels. Sequencers tend not to be used for cytogenetics due to their inability to reliably detect SVs. Cytogenetics laboratories are beginning to adopt the Saphyr system as a more effective, scalable and efficient approach to finding the SVs causative to genetic diseases and cancer. For this segment, the Saphyr system can be used as the sole tool for providing comprehensive and accurate detection of all classes of SVs and enable clinically relevant calls without the need for any sequencing or legacy cytogenetic technology. We estimate that approximately 10,000 cytogenetics labs exist worldwide (excluding India and developing countries).
•Combining OGM with sequencing for molecular genetics and discovery research applications. In discovery research across patient cohorts, sequencing is primarily used to find SNVs responsible for disease or therapeutic response. Sequencing alone, however, is significantly limited due to its inability to reveal SV. Our Saphyr system has been expanding this market segment by complementing sequencing to expand the scope of genome variation that can be analyzed in studies to achieve a more comprehensive view of the genome.
•Cell bioprocessing QC applications. An important part of cell bioprocessing applications is to ensure that genomic modifications did not introduce any SVs into the cell population. As a QC step, our Saphyr system has been used by researchers to evaluate the ability of OGM to detect SVs that may impact cellular stability. Several studies have been published showing the OGM can be used to evaluate cellular stability. We believe that this is an emerging market opportunity and could be up to $3.0 billion annually. 
We believe that if our OGM-based solutions can successfully penetrate these addressable market opportunities, this should spur additional basic and translational research creating new areas where the Saphyr instrument (or successor instruments) and OGM data can be used to improve the standard of care and patient management. These may include preconception, products of conception and prenatal genetic applications, uses to advance gene editing techniques and precision medicine. In the long term, we anticipate potential opportunities in population screening, newborn screening, biopharma applications in cell quality control and oncology.
Our Strategy 
We are primarily focused on driving adoption of OGM through the Saphyr system (and successor instruments). Our goal is to streamline SV identification and enable new research in genomics to allow greater insight into their role in human health in ways that have not been possible with any other current research and diagnostic technologies. 
Our strategy to achieve this includes: 
•Demonstrate that Saphyr is a superior alternative to traditional techniques in constitutional genetic disorders and hematologic malignancy applications. Optical genome mapping has demonstrated superior detection sensitivity for all classes of SVs relative to karyotyping, FISH and CMA in numerous peer-reviewed publications over the past several years and offers benefits of improved assay success rates, faster time to result and a lower total cost. The value proposition and competitive differentiation for OGM in cytogenetics market is exceptionally strong with an immediate opportunity to digitize legacy microscope techniques (karyotyping) with a superior approach using the Saphyr system. 
•Complement NGS with OGM in translational, applied and discovery research markets. We believe the combination of NGS and OGM can provide the most comprehensive and cost-effective analysis of genome variants from SNVs to whole chromosomes. NGS is an accurate technique for measuring genome variants below 500 bp while OGM bridges the gap by enabling detection of all SVs above 500 bp to reveal more answers and resolve previously unresolved cases from using NGS alone. There are over 15,000 NGS instruments installed globally and our vision is for each of these sequencers to be complemented with an OGM system to provide a more comprehensive picture of the genome for more discoveries, publications and translation into molecular genetics. 
•Accelerate broad reimbursement for OGM and establish it as the SOC in guidelines by professional medical societies. We are investing in four multi-center clinical studies for postnatal, prenatal, hematologic malignancies and solid tumor analyses relative to SOC. Each study is designed with an expectation for recruitment of 1,000 subjects and 
Table of Contents

will assess sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, concordance and incremental clinically relevant findings relative to SOC. We are investing in these programs to build the necessary evidence to establish reimbursement and to pave the way for inclusion in professional society guidelines to advance SOC.
•Support the publication of findings with OGM by our customers beyond the more than 687 papers published to date. The annual number of publications featuring data generated by the Saphyr system and its predecessor system has steadily increased since 2010 when the first publication appeared. Recently, the overall number of these publications has grown significantly. For example, of the 521 peer-reviewed and pre-print papers published since 2019, 173 were published in 2022 alone. We intend to continue to support and foster our customer base to help grow the number of publications featuring our systems’ data. We believe that these publications are impactful as our customers’ studies cover SVs in areas of high unmet medical need, such as rare and undiagnosed pediatric diseases, neurological and muscular diseases, developmental delays and disorders, prostate cancer and leukemia. 
•Continue to innovate our products and technologies. We designed the Saphyr system to accommodate performance enhancements without the need for replacement of the entire instrument. For example, hardware upgrades and new consumables are made available to purchase by customers. We intend for these performance enhancements to be delivered on a regular basis. In addition, we periodically make available software upgrades to customers through download at no charge. We expect to continue developing and refining our technologies to improve the ease of use of our Saphyr system and enable our existing installed systems to meaningfully increase sample throughput and sensitivity and specificity of SV detection. A high throughput version is currently in development is expected to significantly increase the throughput and lower the cost per sample. Compared to the Saphyr system, which images DNA at a rate of approximately 205 Gbp per hour, the new system is expected to image nearly 820 Gbp per hour and we announced the placement of a pre-commercial beta system at a customer facility in December 2022. 
•Partner with industry-leading companies and laboratories to expand adoption in clinical markets. Establish additional collaborations with customers to help drive validating studies. Expand partnership efforts with clinical diagnostic companies to commercialize LDTs in the U.S. as well as LDTs and approved tests outside the U.S. 
Sales and Marketing 
As of December 31, 2022, our commercial team consisted of 168 individuals in sales, sales support and marketing. Our sales support personnel include individuals in customer solutions, field service engineers and field application specialists. This commercial staff is primarily located in North America, Europe, and China. Most of our sales support team is located at our headquarters in San Diego and some work remotely throughout the U.S., Europe, and China. 
We sell our products through a direct sales force based in North America and Europe. Our sales strategy involves the use of a combination of sales managers and sales representatives. We intend to increase our sales, support, and marketing efforts in the future by continuing to expand our direct footprint in North America and Europe as well as developing a more comprehensive support network in China and India, where we believe significant market opportunities exist, as we expand our business. 
We sell our products through a network of distributors in the Asia-Pacific region and select other markets outside of North America and Europe. Specifically, we distribute our instruments and reagents via third-party distributors in markets such as China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, India and South Africa. Three of our distributors are in China, one in Australia, one in Italy, one in Sweden, one in Japan, and one in South Korea.
The role of our sales managers and sales representatives is to educate customers on the advantages of Saphyr and the applications that our system makes possible. The role of our field application specialists is to provide on-site training and scientific technical support to prospective and existing customers. Our field application specialists are technical experts with advanced degrees, including seven with PhDs., and generally have extensive experience in academic research and core sequencing lab experience. 
In addition, we maintain an applications lab team in San Diego, California composed of scientific experts who can transfer knowledge from the research and development team to the field application specialists. The applications lab team also runs foundational scientific collaborations and proof of principle studies, which help demonstrate the value of our product offering to prospective customers. This team also provides commercial services by running samples on Saphyr for researchers who do not have a Saphyr system of their own.
Our systems are relatively new to the life science marketplace and require a capital investment by our customers. The sales process typically involves numerous interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the system including having us run experiments on in-house Saphyr systems. In addition, in most countries, sales to academic or governmental institutions require participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. Because of these factors and the budget cycles of our customers, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can often be nine to 12 months.

Bionano Laboratories primarily sells a suite of LDTs to pediatric physicians through a physician-directed “in-person” sales model. This commercial staff is located in North America, and the sales personnel primarily work remotely in U.S. states where Bionano Laboratories has obtained insurance reimbursement. The sales and marketing efforts are targeted primarily on specialty pediatricians, including pediatric neurologists, medical geneticists, and developmental and behavioral pediatricians. Bionano Laboratories also targets general pediatricians with large numbers of patients. Their managed care efforts are directed to establishing contracts and/or credentialing with private and governmental insurance carriers that provide coverage for patients with ASD and other forms of NDDs.
Instruments 
Our instruments are manufactured by a third-party medical device manufacturer. Complete or nearly complete instruments are shipped by the manufacturer to us for final assembly and quality control testing. Upon completion, we ship directly to our customers’ locations globally, or distributors’ locations in the case of certain systems sold in the Asia-Pacific region. Installation of, and training on, our products is provided by our employees in the markets where we conduct direct sales, and by distributors in those markets where we operate with distributors. 
We believe this manufacturing strategy is efficient and conserves capital. However, in the event it becomes necessary to utilize a different contract manufacturer, we would experience additional costs, delays and difficulties in doing so, and our business could be harmed. This manufacturer actively manages obsolescence of all components in our system. This is done through their supply management process where we get notified of any parts that will become obsolete with enough lead time to identify alternatives. 
Consumables 
All of our chip consumables for both OGM and ITP applications are produced by third-party manufacturers at their facilities; however, we have established procedures for a replacement manufacturer if required. We complete final assembly and quality control assessments of our chips at our headquarters in San Diego and our facility in Pleasanton. 
Our OGM reagents are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, including certain single source suppliers. Our ITP reagents are sourced from a limited number of suppliers, including certain single source suppliers and also prepared in-house at our facility in Pleasanton. The OGM reagents include all components required to run a sample on OGM, such as capture and detector reagents, enzyme reagents and enzyme substrate. The ITP reagents include all the components required to run a sample for isolation and purification of nucleic acid. Although we believe that alternatives would be available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement reagents for our assay kits, which could negatively affect our ability to supply assay kits on a timely basis. Some reagents are supplied through a single source supplier. This supplier requires a sufficient notification period to allow for supply continuity and the identification and technology transfer to a new supplier in the event either party wishes to terminate the relationship.
We actively manage component obsolescence by subscribing to our vendors’ end-of-life notifications. If a vendor is unable to provide sufficient notification, we keep safety stock of the component to minimize disruption to operations
Manufacturing and Supply 
Our manufacturing strategy is to outsource instrument and chip manufacturing and internally develop and assemble reagent kits in our own facility. 
Software
Our fundamental long-term software strategy is based on our goal of making OGM ubiquitous. We believe that simplified data interpretation and a seamless integration with NGS and array data to provide the most compressive genome analysis will increase utilization. In addition, we can participate directly in the NGS and array markets for genetic disease and cancer applications independent of OGM using a monetization model with a pay-per-sample NxClinical software offering. In this manner we can expand our network of Bionano customers into our software ecosystem with among the most comprehensive platform-agnostic genome interpretation solution where our proprietary original content in OGM can be adopted when needed to obtain a more comprehensive view of the genome by revealing all classes of SVs. 
Testing and Laboratory Services
Bionano Laboratories’ OGM testing is performed at our lab in San Diego, or at our partner labs in the United States and Europe. Bionano Laboratories intends to increase its testing capacity, and expand its menu of testing. Bionano Laboratories has CLIA certification for its San Diego lab. 
For diagnostic testing, Bionano Laboratories maintains contracts with a network of laboratories to perform the wet work on various non-OGM LDT tests in order to conserve capital and maintain flexibility of adjusting contract labs to seek the best-in-class/most updated technology and customer service. As of December 31, 2022, Bionano Laboratories has established contracts with four primary laboratories to perform wet lab services. All third-party laboratories have met stringent criteria and are CLIA-

certified. Bionano Laboratories obtains raw data from contracted laboratories for select tests and then performs its own interpretation and reporting. In addition to its current menu, Bionano Laboratories’ plans to add OGM-based LDTs to be performed at its San Diego facility, the first two of which have been announced.

Intellectual Property
Genome Analysis 
Our core technology for nucleic acid research is related to methods and devices for non-sequencing based analysis of macromolecules such as nucleic acids. Using this technology, long (UHMC) nucleic acids can be suitably labeled and elongated in order to ascertain structural information such as scaffold organization, copy number, and genomic repeats that is not readily obtained with current sequencing-based approaches. We recently added a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to ITP through the Purigen acquisition, which we plan to continue to pursue and develop. We have secured and continue to pursue intellectual property rights globally, including rights related to isolation, purification and analysis of nucleic acid molecules, as well as innovations in the molecular biology and bioinformatics spaces. Additionally, our portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to related parts of our business, including certain diagnostic tests and methods of diagnosis and analysis of microarray and image data. 
We have developed a global patent portfolio that includes more than 160 issued patents or allowed applications across approximately 35 patent families that are either owned or exclusively licensed. The owned and licensed patent families contain issued patents and pending applications that relate to devices, systems, and methods for macromolecular analysis, isolation and purification of molecules, genetic testing, computer software systems and reflect our active and ongoing research programs.
In addition to pursuing patents, we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, as applicable, advisors. 
In addition to a robust and active patent portfolio, we believe that our software and algorithms for analysis, visualization and interpretation of genomic data represent a valuable asset that we continue to develop and exploit through current and planned software offerings.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to and impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and internationally. These include laws and regulations particular to our business and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally (e.g., export controls laws, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions). We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. Set forth below are highlights of certain key regulatory schemes applicable to our business. Below are discussions concerning government regulation of our Optical Genome Mapping, or OGM, products and services and, separately, the Diagnostic Services performed by Bionano Laboratories.
Optical Genome Mapping
Our OGM products are currently intended for research use only, or RUO, applications, although our customers may use our products to develop their own products that are subject to regulation by the FDA. Although most products intended for RUO are not currently subject to clearance or approval by the FDA, RUO products fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction if they are used for clinical rather than research purposes. Consequently, our products are labeled “For Research Use Only.” 
The FDA’s 2013 Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff on “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only,” or, the RUO/IUO Guidance, provides the FDA’s thinking on when IVD products are properly labeled for RUO or for IUO. The RUO/IUO Guidance explains that the FDA will review the totality of the circumstances when evaluating whether equipment and testing components are properly labeled as RUO. Merely including a labeling statement that a product is intended for research use only will not necessarily exempt the device from the FDA’s 510(k) clearance, premarket approval, or other requirements, if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer intends its product to be used for clinical diagnostic use. These circumstances may include written or verbal marketing claims or links to articles regarding a product’s performance in clinical applications, a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical applications, or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO labeling. 
When marketed for clinical diagnostic use, our products will be regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA defines a medical device in part as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article which is intended for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man. FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of medical devices. The FDA also requires the device to be registered by the medical device manufacturer and listed as a marketed product. 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the intended use of the device, the risk associated with the use of the device for that indication, as determined by the FDA, and on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices, which have the lowest level of risk associated 
Table of Contents

with them, are subject to general controls. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls and premarket approval. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from a requirement that the manufacturer submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), and receive clearance from the FDA which is otherwise a premarketing requirement for a Class II device. Class III devices may not be commercialized until a premarket approval application, or PMA, is submitted to and approved by the FDA. 
510(k) Clearance Pathway 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a sponsor must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent, or SE, to a device legally marketed in the U.S. for which a PMA was not required. The FDA is supposed to make a SE determination within 90 days of FDA’s receipt of the 510(k), but it often takes longer if the FDA requests additional information. Most 510(k)s do not require supporting data from clinical trials, but the FDA may request such data. 
Premarket Approval Pathway 
A PMA must be submitted if a new device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is generally more complex, costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. After a PMA is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin an in-depth review of the submitted information. By statute, the FDA has 180 days to review the accepted application, although, review of the application generally can take between one and three years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with its quality system regulations, or QSRs. New premarket approval applications or premarket approval application supplements are also required for product modifications that affect the safety and efficacy of the device. 
Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials are usually required to support a PMA and are sometimes required for a 510(k). In the U.S., if the device is determined to present a “significant risk,” the manufacturer may not begin a clinical trial until it submits an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, and obtains approval of the IDE from the FDA. These clinical trials are also subject to the review, approval and oversight of an IRB at each clinical trial site. The clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations and good clinical practices. A clinical trial may be suspended by the FDA, the sponsor or an IRB at its institution at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the study participants outweigh the benefits of participation in the trial. Even if a clinical trial is completed, the results may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a device to the satisfaction of the FDA, or may be equivocal or otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of a device. 
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include among other things: 
•Compliance with QSRs, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, record maintenance, including maintenance of complaint and related investigation files, and other quality assurance controls during the manufacturing process;
•Reporting of device malfunctions, serious injuries or deaths;
•Registration of the establishments where the devices are produced and listing of the devices with the FDA;
•Labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved uses; and
•Medical device reporting obligations, which require that manufacturers investigate and report to the FDA adverse events, including deaths, or serious injuries that may have been or were caused by a medical device and malfunctions in the device that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, including but not limited to, warning letters; fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; recall or seizure of the device; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new devices; withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals; and civil or criminal prosecution. To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA.

Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs)
Federal agencies involved in the regulation of LDTs include CMS and the FDA. CMS regulates the quality of clinical laboratories and the clinical testing process pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) and the FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of the diagnostic test pursuant to authorities in the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Although the FDA has statutory authority to regulate medical devices, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDCA and FDA regulations with respect to LDTs, which are a subset of in vitro diagnostic tests that are intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used entirely within a single laboratory. The FDA does not consider devices to be LDTs if they are designed or manufactured completely, or partly, outside of the laboratory that offers and uses them. We sell our Saphyr system on an RUO basis to CLIA certified cytogenetic laboratories, which may use the system to develop LDTs.
At various times since 2006, the FDA has issued documents outlining its intent to require varying levels of FDA oversight of many types of LDTs. Congress has also considered legislation that would change how LDTs are regulated. It is unclear at this time if or when the FDA will finalize its plans to end enforcement discretion for LDTs, and even then, whether the new regulatory requirements are expected to be phased-in over time. However, the FDA may decide to regulate certain LDTs on a case-by-case basis at any time. A significant change in the way that the FDA regulates any LDTs that we, our collaborators, or our customers develop using our technology could affect our business. If the FDA requires laboratories to undergo premarket review and comply with other applicable FDA requirements in the future, the cost and time required to commercialize an LDT will increase substantially and may reduce the financial incentive for laboratories to develop LDTs, which could reduce demand for our instruments and our other products. In addition, if the FDA were to change the way that it regulates LDTs to require that we undergo pre-market review or comply with other applicable FDA requirements before we can sell our instruments or our other products to clinical cytogenetics laboratories, our ability to sell our instruments and other products to this addressable market would be delayed, thereby impeding our ability to penetrate this market and generate revenue from sales of our instruments and our other products. 
Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation 
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of our product for clinical diagnostic use in those countries. The regulations in other jurisdictions vary from those in the U.S. and may be easier or more difficult to satisfy and are subject to change. For example, the European Union recently published new regulations that will result in greater regulation of medical devices and IVDs. The IVD Regulation is significantly different from the IVD Directive that it replaces in that it will ensure that the new requirements apply uniformly and on the same schedule across the member states, including a risk-based classification system and increasing the requirements for conformity assessment. The conformity assessment process results in the receipt of a CE designation which has been sufficient to begin marketing many types of IVDs. That process will become more difficult and costly to complete. 
Other Governmental Regulation 
We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials that we may use during our research.
Laboratories that purchase certain of our OGM products and perform clinical diagnostic testing are also subject to extensive regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, requiring clinical laboratories to meet specified standards in areas such as personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Adverse interpretations of current CLIA regulations or future changes in CLIA regulations could have an adverse effect on sales of any affected products. Moreover, if we decide to operate our own clinical testing laboratory with respect to our OGM products, such clinical testing would require compliance with CLIA. If, in the future, we operate our own clinical laboratory to perform clinical diagnostic testing with respect to our OGM products, such activities would become subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its corresponding regulations, as well as additional federal and state laws that impose a variety of fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
Currently, our OGM products are for research use only, but clinical laboratories may acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase or capital lease and use the Saphyr system and direct label and stain chemistry to create their own diagnostic tests and potentially seek reimbursement for such tests. Our customers may generate revenue for these testing services by seeking the necessary approval of their product from the FDA or CMS, along with coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health programs and private health plans. The ability of our customers to commercialize diagnostic tests based on our technology will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these tests will be available from such third-party payors. 
In the U.S., molecular testing laboratories have multiple options for reimbursement coding, but we expect that the primary codes used will be the genomic sequencing procedure codes, or GSPs. The American Medical Association, or AMA, added GSPs to its clinical laboratory fee schedule in 2015. In addition, CMS issued a coverage determination providing for the reimbursement of next-generation sequencing for certain cancer diagnostics using an FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic test. Private health plans often follow CMS coverage and reimbursement guidelines to a substantial degree, and it is difficult to predict what CMS will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement of any products or services our customers try to commercialize. 
In Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, The Netherlands) tend to be more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with tax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets. 
Ultimately, coverage and reimbursement of new products and services is uncertain, and whether laboratories that use our instruments to develop their own products or services will attain coverage and adequate reimbursement is unknown. In the U.S., there is no uniform policy for determining coverage and reimbursement. Coverage can differ from payor to payor, and the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls and restrictions on reimbursement. 
Diagnostic Services
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
As a clinical laboratory, Bionano Laboratories is required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications and permits to conduct is business. As to federal certifications, in 1988, Congress passed the CLIA, establishing more rigorous quality standards for all commercial laboratories that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease or the assessment of the health or impairment of human beings. CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal healthcare programs, as well as many commercial third-party payers, for laboratory testing services. Both of Bionano Laboratories’ facilities, one located in Salt Lake City, Utah and the other in San Diego, California are CLIA certified. These laboratories must comply with all applicable CLIA requirements. If a clinical laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA standards, CMS may impose sanctions, limit or revoke the laboratory’s CLIA certificate (and prohibit the owner, operator or laboratory director from owning, operating, or directing a laboratory for two years following license revocation), a directed plan of correction, on-site monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil actions for injunctive relief, criminal penalties, or suspension or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory licensure requirements and regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law and requires compliance with such laws and regulations. The State of Utah follows all CLIA regulations for laboratory facility and personnel requirements. Utah does not have any additional licensure and regulations. The State of California follows CLIA regulations for in-state laboratory facilities, but requires additional licensing requirements for laboratory personnel established by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). CAP accreditation for the San Diego facility is pending. 
Additionally, certain states require clinical laboratories to obtain out-of-state licenses to test specimens from patients, or to receive orders from physicians, within those states. Our Salt Lake City facility currently holds such out-of-state laboratory licenses in Pennsylvania and Maryland.

HIPAA and other Privacy Laws 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), established comprehensive federal standards for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers that conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (“Covered Entities”). Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by, among other things, limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures. 
On February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH expanded and strengthened HIPAA, created new targets for enforcement, imposed new penalties for noncompliance and established new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities. Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013 through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (the “Omnibus Rule”). 
Under HITECH's breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”). Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and, in some cases depending on the size of the breach, they must be reported through local and national media. Breach reports can lead to investigation, enforcement and civil litigation, including class action lawsuits. 
As a result of the clinical diagnostic services offered by Bionano Laboratories, Bionano Laboratories, is currently subject to HIPAA and maintains an active compliance program that is designed to identify security incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, mitigate harm or report if required by law. Bionano Laboratories is subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. Bionano Laboratories is also subject to enforcement by state attorneys general who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To mitigate penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, Bionano Laboratories must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the company, so that Bionano Laboratories can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if Bionano Laboratories makes required reports on a timely basis, Bionano Laboratories may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach. 
In addition to the federal privacy and security regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our clinical laboratories. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results by strictly limiting the disclosure of those results. State requirements are particularly stringent regarding predictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a high risk for disease. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, including genetic testing and genetic information privacy laws in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, these laws constantly change, and we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, significant reputational damage and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all EU member states from May 25, 2018, also applies to some of our operations. The GDPR is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this report. The GDPR applies not only to organizations within the EU, but also applies to organizations outside of the EU that offer goods or services to EU data subjects or that process or hold personal data of EU data subjects. Additionally, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (“UK GDPR”), which, together with the amended United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in the United Kingdom national law. Both the GDPR and the UK GDPR regulations specify potential liabilities for certain data protection violations, and we anticipate that it will result in a greater compliance burden for us as we conduct our business in the European Union. Fines for non-compliance can range from the greater of 2% of annual global revenues or €10 million, up to the greater of 4% of annual global revenues or €20 million. The GDPR is discussed in more detail under the heading “International Regulations” below.

Reimbursement and Billing 
Reimbursement and billing for diagnostic services is highly complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as private third-party payors, including managed care organizations (“MCO”), and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing requirements. Additionally, the audit requirements Bionano Laboratories must meet to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process. Other factors that complicate billing include: 
•variability in coverage and information requirements among various payors;
•patient financial assistance programs; 
•missing, incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians; 
•billings to payors with whom we do not have contracts; 
•disputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and 
•disputes with payors as to the appropriate level of reimbursement. 
Depending on the reimbursement arrangement and applicable law, the party that reimburses us for our services may be: 
•a third-party who provides coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company or MCO; 
•a state or federal healthcare program; or 
•the patient. 
Presently, approximately 90% of the diagnostic service revenue for Bionano Laboratories is paid by private third-party payors. 
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws 
A variety of state and federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”), and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. Any overpayments must be repaid within 60 days of identification unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger set of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments. 
Anti-Kickback Laws 
The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. “Remuneration” is broadly defined to include anything of monetary value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statute can be interpreted broadly to prohibit many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. 
Recognizing the potential breadth of interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many otherwise innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors intended to protect such arrangements. Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution but would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These sanctions include criminal, civil and administrative penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors.
Further, the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018, or EKRA, prohibits payments for referrals to recovery homes, clinical treatment facilities, and laboratories. EKRA’s reach extends beyond federal health care programs to include private insurance (i.e., it is an “all payor” statute). For purposes of EKRA, the term “laboratory” is defined broadly and without reference to any connection to substance use disorder treatment. The law includes a limited number of exceptions, some of which closely align with corresponding federal Anti-Kickback Statute exceptions and safe harbors, and others that materially differ.

Physician Self-Referral Bans 
The federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including but not limited to: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor. 
State and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims 
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he or she has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties, as well as possible exclusion from federal health care programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor. 
Civil Monetary Penalties Law 
The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things, (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense. 
Penalties
Failure to comply with the aforementioned fraud and abuse laws could result in significant penalties, including civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, imprisonment, contractual damages, and reputational harm. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
International Regulations
We market some of our tests outside of the United States and are subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical testing, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may require us to implement additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. For example, the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices (2017/746/EU) (“IVDR”) will replace the existing In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (98/79/EC) (“IVDD”) in the European Union (“EU”). The IVDR was published in May 2017, marking the start of a five-year period of transition from the IVDD. During the transitional period the IVDR will come into force gradually, starting with the provisions related to the designation of Notified Bodies and the ability of manufacturers to apply for new certificates under the IVDR. The transitional period will end on 26 May 2022, the “Date of Application” (“DoA”) of the Regulation. From that point the IVDR will apply fully. The EU has also implemented the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires us to meet new and more stringent requirements regarding the handling of personal data about European Union residents. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. We are also required to maintain accurate information on and control over sales and distributors’ activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.

Other Regulatory Requirements 
Our laboratories, and the laboratories of Bionano Laboratories, are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples and other human tissue. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste. 
We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
Healthcare Reform 
In the U.S. and abroad, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs and change the way healthcare is financed. By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, became law. The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. 
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, such as removing penalties, effective January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Further, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the coverage gap under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and through a newly established manufacturer discount program. In addition, on April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was signed into law, which, among other things, significantly altered the payment methodology under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS. PAMA requires certain laboratories performing clinical diagnostic laboratory tests to report to CMS the amounts paid by private payors for laboratory tests. Beginning on January 1, 2018, CMS has begun using reported private payor pricing to periodically revise payment rates under the CLFS. Based on current law, between January 1, 2023 and March 31, 2023, applicable laboratories will be required to report on data collected during January 1, 2019 and June 30, 2019. This data will be utilized to determine 2024 to 2026 CLFS rates.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services. In addition, sales of our tests outside of the U.S. will subject us to foreign regulatory requirements, which may also change over time.
