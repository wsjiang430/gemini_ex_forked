Item 1. Business.
We are an early stage blank check company formed on September 11, 2020 as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Since our initial public offering (as described below), we have focused our search for an initial business combination on businesses that may provide significant opportunities for attractive investor returns. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we have focused on finding businesses primarily operating in the healthcare sector in the United States and we entered into a business combination agreement with TriSalus on November 11, 2022.
Initial Public Offering and Extension of our Combination Period
On December 22, 2020, we consummated our initial public offering of 25,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $250,000,000.
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 4,933,333 warrants to our sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $7,400,000.
A total of $250,000,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.
We originally had up to 24 months from the closing of our initial public offering, or until December 22, 2022, to consummate an initial business combination. However, at the Extension Special Meeting held on December 12, 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination from December 22, 2022 to June 22, 2023 (or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors). In connection with the Extension Special Meeting, stockholders holding 23,046,578 public shares exercised their right to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account. As a result, approximately $232.37 million (approximately $10.08 per public share) was removed from the trust account and paid to such holders and approximately $19.70 million remained in the trust account. Following the redemptions, the Company had 1,953,422 public shares outstanding. In connection with the approval of the Extension, the Company issued the 2022 Extension Note to the sponsor, and the sponsor (or one or more of its affiliates, members or third-party designees) provided the Extension Funds to the Company. The 2022 Extension Note does not bear interest and matures upon the closing of the Company’s initial business combination. In the event that the Company does not consummate a business combination, the 2022 Extension Note will be repaid only from amounts remaining outside of the trust account, if any. The proceeds from the initial payment under the Extension Contributions have been deposited in the trust account in connection with the Extension.
It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Karim Karti, our Chairman, Christopher C. Dewey, our Chief Executive Officer and director, David J. Matlin, our Chief Financial Officer and director, and Robert H. Weiss, our Chief Administrative Officer and Secretary. We must complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period. If our initial business combination with TriSalus or another target company is not consummated within the Combination Period, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.
Termination of Memic Business Combination Agreement
On August 12, 2021, we entered into the Memic Business Combination Agreement with Memic and Memic Merger Sub. On March 9, 2022, we convened and then adjourned, without conducting any other business, a special meeting of stockholders relating to the proposed business combination with Memic and the other transactions contemplated by the Memic Business Combination Agreement.
On March 10, 2022, we entered into the Termination Agreement with Memic and Memic Merger Sub, under which the parties agreed to mutually terminate the Memic Business Combination Agreement. The termination of the Memic Business Combination Agreement became effective as of March 9, 2022.

As a result of the termination of the Memic Business Combination Agreement, the Memic Business Combination Agreement, along with any Transaction Agreement (as defined in the Memic Business Combination Agreement) entered into in connection therewith, are void and there is no liability under either of the Memic Business Combination Agreement or any Transaction Agreement on the part of any party thereto (including, without limitation, under the SPAC Sponsor Letter Agreement by and among Memic, the sponsor, and the other parties signatory thereto dated August 12, 2021). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, the Company, Memic and Memic Merger Sub have also agreed, on behalf of themselves and their respective related parties, to a release of claims relating to the proposed business combination.
TriSalus Business Combination
TriSalus Merger Agreement
On November 11, 2022, the Company entered into the TriSalus Merger Agreement with Merger Sub, and TriSalus under which Merger Sub will merge with and into TriSalus, with TriSalus surviving the TriSalus Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The TriSalus Business Combination is subject to certain closing conditions as summarized below under “Conditions to Closing.” Upon consummation of the TriSalus Business Combination, the Company will be renamed “TriSalus Life Sciences, Inc.” Capitalized terms not defined herein, but otherwise used in the following description have the meanings ascribed to them in the TriSalus Merger Agreement.
 Merger Consideration
The aggregate consideration payable to the stockholders of TriSalus at the closing of the TriSalus Business Combination (the “Closing”) is $220,000,000, payable solely in shares of the Company’s common stock, valued at $10.00 per share (the “Closing Merger Consideration”). Immediately prior to the Closing, the shares of Class A common stock and the warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock issued to the public stockholders that comprise each issued and outstanding unit will be automatically separated, if not already separated prior to such time, and the holder thereof shall be deemed to hold one share of Class A common stock and one-third of one warrant to purchase Class A common stock; provided that any fractional warrants issuable to a holder upon the separation of the units will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of warrants. Following the separation of the units but prior to the Closing, the Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common stock, and pursuant to the proposed amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be effective immediately prior to the Closing, if approved by the Company’s stockholders, Class A common stock and Class B common stock will be reclassified into a single class of common stock.
Immediately prior to the Closing, each share of TriSalus’ issued and outstanding preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of TriSalus common stock (the “Preferred Conversion”), and all in-the-money TriSalus warrants that would be exercised or otherwise exchanged in full in accordance with their terms by virtue of the occurrence of the TriSalus Business Combination will be exercised for shares of TriSalus common stock, such that the holders thereof will receive Closing Merger Consideration as holders of TriSalus common stock. TriSalus warrants that are out-of-the-money will be cancelled for no consideration immediately prior to the Closing. At the time of the TriSalus Business Combination, the outstanding options for shares of TriSalus common stock under TriSalus’ equity plan will be assumed by the Company and converted into options to purchase common stock (the “Assumed Equity”).
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
The TriSalus Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by the parties thereto, including, among other things, covenants with respect to the conduct of the Company and TriSalus during the period between execution of the TriSalus Merger Agreement and the Closing, including the parties’ agreement not to solicit or enter into any inquiry, proposal or offer, or any indication of interest in making an offer or proposal for an alternative competing transactions. The representations, warranties and covenants made under the TriSalus Merger Agreement will not survive the Closing; provided, however, that any covenants that are to be performed at or after the Closing shall survive until such covenant has been performed or satisfied pursuant to their terms. Each of the Company and TriSalus have agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the TriSalus Business Combination to be consummated as soon as practicable.

2



Post-Closing Board of Directors
Prior to the Closing, the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to designate and nominate to the Company’s board of directors nine directors, which shall include seven directors designated by TriSalus (with at least a majority of the authorized number of such directors to qualify as “independent directors” pursuant to Nasdaq listing standards) (the “TriSalus Directors”), and two directors as non-executive directors designated solely by the Company (the “Company Directors”). Following the Closing, the board of directors will be a classified board with three classes of directors.
No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals
Each party also agreed, during the period between the execution of the TriSalus Merger Agreement and continuing until the earlier of its Closing or termination, not to solicit or enter into any alternative competing transactions.
Conditions to Closing
The Closing is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, that (i) the stockholders of TriSalus and the stockholders of the Company approve the TriSalus Business Combination, (ii) Nasdaq approves for listing the common stock to be issued in connection with the TriSalus Business Combination, (iii) the Company has at least $60,000,000 in Available Closing Acquiror Cash (as defined in the TriSalus Merger Agreement), which amount includes any proceeds or committed amounts from private equity or debt sources, the remaining balance in the Company’s trust account (after taking into account stockholder redemptions), minus the payment of up to $6,000,000 of the Company’s transaction expenses (subject to potential increases as further described in the TriSalus Merger Agreement) (such amount, the “Company Transaction Expenses Cap”), (iv) for the calendar year ending December 31, 2023, either (a) by legislation or application regulatory action, the Transitional Pass through Payment (“TPT”) provision applicable to TriSalus’ TriNav™ Infusion System will have been extended or a permanent reimbursement code will have been assigned to the TriNav™ Infusion System as specified in the TriSalus Merger Agreement or (b) use of existing reimbursement codes with respect to the TriNav™ Infusion System will provide adequate profitability to TriSalus (the “Payment Condition”), and (v) the Company has $5,000,001 or more in net tangible assets at the Closing. On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (H.R. 2617) was signed into law and includes an extension to the TPT payment status for certain devices, including the TriNav™ Infusion System, through December 31, 2023, which satisfied the Payment Condition.
Termination
The TriSalus Merger Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing under certain circumstances, including, among others, (i) by written consent of TriSalus and the Company, (ii) by written notice from either the Company or TriSalus, if (A) the Closing has not occurred on or before December 22, 2022, as such date may be extended to match any extension to the Company’s last date to consummate an initial business combination under its certificate of incorporation (currently June 22, 2023) obtained by approval of the Company’s stockholders (the “Outside Date”), unless the terminating party’s failure to comply in any material respect with its obligations under the TriSalus Merger Agreement shall have contributed to the failure of the Closing to have occurred on or prior to the Outside Date, (B) the consummation of the TriSalus Business Combination is permanently enjoined, (C) the Company does not obtain stockholder approval of the TriSalus Business Combination at the special meeting at which such approval shall be voted upon, or (D) by March 31, 2023, the Company shall not have obtained commitments for private financing of at least $40,000,000 in support of the TriSalus Business Combination, (iii) by written notice from either the Company or TriSalus, in the event that the other party breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements under the TriSalus Merger Agreement that would result in the failure of the conditions to the Company’s or TriSalus’ obligation to consummate the TriSalus Business Combination and such breach has not been cured by the breaching party within 30 days after receiving notice of such breach, (iv) by TriSalus at any time prior to the approval of the TriSalus Business Combination by the Company’s public stockholders, if the board of directors of the Company has made a change in recommendation to its stockholders regarding the TriSalus Business Combination, and (v) by written notice to TriSalus from the Company, if TriSalus does not obtain stockholder approval within 25 days after delivering an information statement regarding the TriSalus Business Combination to its stockholders.

3



Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement
On the day of Closing, the Company will enter into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the “A&R RRA”) with the sponsor, and certain TriSalus stockholders (the “Requisite Stockholders,” and together with the sponsor, collectively, the “Investors”), which, among other things, amends and restates the registration rights agreement entered into by and among the Company and the sponsor at the time of the Company’s initial public offering. Pursuant to the terms of the A&R RRA, among other things, the Company will be obligated to file, within 45 days of the Closing, a registration statement covering re-sale of the shares of common stock issued or issuable to the Investors. Subject to certain requirements and customary conditions, the A&R RRA also provides the Investors with piggyback registration rights and demand registration rights. The A&R RRA provides that the Company will pay certain expenses relating to such registration and indemnify the Investors against certain liabilities.
Lock-up Agreement
In connection with the entry into the TriSalus Merger Agreement, on November 11, 2022, the Requisite Stockholders entered into lock-up agreements (the “Lock-up Agreements”) with the Company, pursuant to which the Requisite Stockholders will not transfer shares of common stock held by them prior to the earliest of (x) three hundred and sixty-five (365) days after the Closing, (y) the date on which the last sales price of common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein, for any 20 trading days within any 30-consecutive-day trading period commencing at least 150 days after the Closing, and (z) the date following Closing on which the Company consummates a liquidation, merger, tender offer, or similar transaction resulting in all the Company stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities, or other property.
Sponsor Support Agreement
In connection with the entry into the TriSalus Merger Agreement, on November 11, 2022, the sponsor entered into a support agreement (the “Sponsor Support Agreement”) with the Company and TriSalus, pursuant to which the sponsor agreed, among other things, to vote or cause to be voted (or express consent or dissent in writing, as applicable) all its shares of common stock that are entitled to vote to approve and adopt the TriSalus Merger Agreement and the TriSalus Business Combination. The sponsor also agreed (i) not to sell or transfer any of its shares of Common Stock or the Company warrants prior to the Closing, except to affiliates of the sponsor who execute a joinder to the Sponsor Support Agreement or by private sales or transfers made in connection with any forward purchase agreement or similar arrangement or in connection with the consummation of the TriSalus Business Combination, (ii) to assume the transaction expenses of the Company which exceed the Company Transaction Expenses Cap, (iii) to forfeit 2,187,500 shares of common stock (which represents 35% of the sponsor’s shares of the Company as of November 11, 2022), and (iv) to subject 3,125,000 of its shares of common stock (which represents 50% of the sponsor’s shares of the Company as of November 11, 2022) to certain vesting restrictions as set forth in the Sponsor Support Agreement (it being understood that the undertakings in the foregoing clauses (iii) and (iv) shall be null and void in the event that the Sponsor Support Agreement or TriSalus Merger Agreement is terminated).
Stockholder Support Agreements
In connection with the entry into the TriSalus Merger Agreement, on November 11, 2022, the Company, TriSalus, and the Requisite Stockholders executed and delivered support agreements (the “Stockholder Support Agreements”), pursuant to which each Requisite Stockholder agreed to, among other things, (i) consent to, and vote to approve and adopt, the TriSalus Merger Agreement and the TriSalus Business Combination, (ii) waive any dissenters’ or approval rights under applicable law in connection with the TriSalus Business Combination, and (iii) not transfer, subject to certain permitted exceptions, any of such stockholder’s TriSalus shares prior to the Closing.
Raymond James Agreements
Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (“Raymond James”) was originally engaged by the Company to act as sole manager for the IPO and would be entitled to a deferred underwriting fee of $8,750,000 upon the consummation of a business combination. In connection with the entry into the TriSalus Merger Agreement, on November 11, 2022, the Company and Raymond James amended that certain Underwriting Agreement, dated December 17, 2020, pursuant to which, Raymond James agreed to waive the foregoing deferred underwriting fee in its entirety if the TriSalus Business Combination is consummated. Raymond James was separately engaged by the Company to act as its investment banking advisor in connection with a business combination, and will receive customary fees for its 

4



services in that role if the TriSalus Business Combination is consummated. The Company also engaged Raymond James to act as sole placement agent for an institutional debt financing that resulted in the Company’s entry into the non-binding term sheet with Magnetar (discussed below). In consideration for its services as the Company’s investment banking advisor and its services as placement agent, Raymond James will be entitled to receive an aggregate fee ranging between $3 million to $4.5 million from the Company at the Closing plus expense reimbursements, depending on the amount raised in the institutional debt financing with Magnetar and/or other institutional investors, excluding any incremental fee consideration for exercise of the greenshoe. If the Company is unable to consummate the TriSalus Business Combination or is unable to obtain private financing in connection with the TriSalus Business Combination, then Raymond James will not receive any compensation for its investment banking advisory or placement agent services, respectively.
Ceros Engagement Agreement
In March 2023, the Company and the sponsor engaged Ceros Financial Services, Inc. (“Ceros”) to render certain advisory and placement services to the Company. Pursuant to such engagement, the sponsor (and not the Company) would be solely responsible for any and all fees and expenses payable to Ceros, if any, that would arise or accrue prior to, or in connection with, the closing of an initial business combination.
Non-Binding Term Sheet
In connection with the entry into the TriSalus Merger Agreement, on November 11, 2022, the Company, TriSalus and Magnetar entered into a non-binding term sheet concerning the Magnetar Convertible Notes, which provides for the sale and issuance by the Company of up to $50,000,000 of 8.0% senior secured convertible notes concurrently with the closing of the TriSalus Business Combination. The term sheet, which grants Magnetar the exclusive right to negotiate the foregoing proposed debt financing, provides for the Company to issue $25,000,000 to $50,000,000 of such Magnetar Convertible Notes at the Closing, and grants Magnetar the option to purchase the same principal amount of purchased Magnetar Convertible Notes during the two-year period following the Closing (resulting in the potential issuance of up to $100,000,000 of such Magnetar Convertible Notes). The Magnetar Convertible Notes would have a three-year maturity and would be convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $10.00 per share, with conversion price resets and certain anti-dilution rights, with the conversion feature subject to certain ownership limitations. Other than exclusivity and certain expense reimbursement and indemnity obligations of the Company and TriSalus, the term sheet is non-binding on each of the parties thereto, and the parties’ obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated therein are subject in all respects to the completion of Magnetar’s due diligence process, the negotiation and execution of definitive transaction documents to Magnetar’s satisfaction, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions (including, but not limited to, the Payment Condition. On December 29, 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (H.R. 2617) was signed into law and includes an extension to the TPT payment status for certain devices, including the TriNav™ Infusion System, through December 31, 2023, which satisfied the Payment Condition. Currently, the amount potentially subject to funding, subject in all respects to the completion of Magnetar’s due diligence process, the negotiation and execution of definitive transaction documents to Magnetar’s satisfaction, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, is $25 million. Based upon information set forth in a Schedule 13D/A filed on February 9, 2023, Magnetar Financial LLC, an affiliate of Magnetar, collectively owned with its affiliates an aggregate of 1,145,833 shares of Class A common stock, which represents 58.7% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Class A common stock following the Extension Special Meeting.
Changes and Additional Information in Connection with SEC Filings
In connection with the TriSalus Merger Agreement and proposed TriSalus Business Combination, the Company filed the TriSalus Registration Statement that includes a proxy statement/prospectus of the Company, that is both the proxy statement to be distributed to holders of the Company’s common stock in connection with its solicitation of proxies for the vote by the Company’s stockholders with respect to the TriSalus Business Combination and other matters, as well as the prospectus relating to the offer and sale of the securities to be issued in the TriSalus Business Combination. The TriSalus Registration Statement is not yet effective. The TriSalus Registration Statement, including the proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, when it is declared effective by the SEC, will contain important information about the TriSalus Business Combination and the other matters to be voted upon at a meeting of the Company’s stockholders to be held to approve the TriSalus Business Combination and other matters (the “Special Meeting”). The Company may also file other documents with the SEC regarding the TriSalus Business Combination. The Company’s stockholders and other interested persons are advised to read, when available, the TriSalus Registration Statement, including the proxy statement/prospectus contained therein, as well as any amendments or supplements thereto, because they will contain important information about the TriSalus Business 

5



Combination. When available, the definitive proxy statement/prospectus will be mailed to the Company stockholders as of a record date to be established for voting on the TriSalus Business Combination and the other matters to be voted upon at the Special Meeting.
The foregoing descriptions of each of the TriSalus Merger Agreement, the form of the A&R RRA, the form of the Lock Up Agreement, the Sponsor Letter Agreement, the form of the Amendment to Underwriting Agreement, the form Stockholder Support Agreements, non-binding term sheet concerning Magnetar Convertible Notes, and the 2022 Extension Note, are not complete and are subject to and qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, copies of which are filed with this Report as Exhibits 2.1, 10.14, 10.15, 10.16, 10.17, 10.18 and 10.19, respectively, and the terms of which are incorporated by reference herein. 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of the TriSalus Business Combination. 
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a medical technology company in the healthcare sector, including TriSalus. Moreover, we seek an opportunity that complements the experience of our management team and can benefit from their medical technology, operational, financial, and marketing expertise. Our selection process leverages the management team’s broad and deep relationships, unique industry experience, and deal sourcing capabilities to access a wide spectrum of opportunities. This network has been developed over the past two decades while serving in executive roles at successful organizations. We believe that our management team will identify a business combination that will benefit from their experience, including:
●Long history of sourcing, structuring, acquiring, operating, developing, growing, and financing healthcare businesses;
●Identifying medical technologies that fill unmet needs or shift treatment paradigms to create substantial benefits to the healthcare industry and therefore produce substantial financial value;
●Significant experience commercializing new medical technologies and systems;
●Strong marketing and capital allocation decision-making to establish and maintain a recognizable brand; and
●Sound understanding of public company performance requirements and guiding private-to-public process.
Acquisition Criteria
Our acquisition strategy leverages our management team’s proprietary network of long-standing relationships and industry contacts as well as inbound opportunities to source a business combination. In the event the TriSalus Business Combination is not consummated, consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including the TriSalus Business Combination, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that only meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. We intend to identify and acquire one or more medical technology businesses that exhibit a number of the following criteria:
●Developing technology enabled solutions, including robotics, that aid in the diagnosis, cure, monitoring, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of medical conditions or affect the structure or function of the body
●Innovative surgical interventions, robotics, diagnosis and imaging, drug delivery and patient monitoring, or assistive care and therapy devices
●Companies at an inflection point where we can use our expertise to expand services and offerings, develop efficiencies and processes, foster growth, and improve financial performance
●Clear path to commercialization, recently commercialized, or could benefit from our management team’s expertise in sales growth

6



●Differentiated technology protected by robust intellectual property
●Opportunity to benefit from the leadership and strategic vision of our management team
●Offers a scientific or other competitive advantage in the markets in which they operate and which can benefit from access to additional capital as well as our management’s industry relationships and expertise
●Would benefit from being publicly traded and having access to incremental growth capital
These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, criteria, and guidelines that our management may deem relevant. In addition to any potential business candidates we identify on our own, other target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest non-core assets or divisions. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that only meets some but not all of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet all of the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial business combination, which would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC, such as the TriSalus Registration Statement. 
Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed, including the TriSalus Business Combination, will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
Acquisition Process
In evaluating a prospective target business such as TriSalus, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompasses, as applicable and among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry. We have utilized and will continue to utilize our management team’s operational and capital planning experience.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. While TriSalus is not affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors in the event we do not consummate the TriSalus Business Combination and seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Members of our management team directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she then has fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.

7



No members of our management team have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware, unless presented to such member specifically in his or her capacity as an officer or a director of the company. Members of our management team may be required to present potential business combinations to other entities to whom they have fiduciary duties before they present such opportunities to us. Any knowledge or presentation of such opportunities may therefore present conflicts of interest.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq rules and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses, including TriSalus, that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and net of taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any initial business combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that, at the time the TriSalus Merger Agreement was entered into, the fair market value of TriSalus was in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.
In the event the TriSalus Merger is not consummated, we anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may however, structure our initial business combination in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of fair market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as our initial business combination for purposes of seeking stockholder approval or conducting a tender offer, as applicable.
The net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants released to us from the trust account upon the closing of our initial business combination may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. In addition, we may be required to obtain additional financing in connection with the closing of our initial business combination to be used following the closing for general corporate purposes as described above. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following consummation of our initial public offering. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. None of our sponsor, officers, directors 

8



or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. We may also obtain financing prior to the closing of our initial business combination to fund our working capital needs and transaction costs in connection with our search for and completion of our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, following our initial public offering and prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to receive funds from the trust account or vote on any initial business combination, on any pre-business combination activity or on any amendment to Article IX of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
Our Management Team
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that any member of our management team devotes in any time period varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process that we are in.
We believe our management team’s operating and transaction experience and relationships with companies provide us with a substantial number of potential business combination targets. Over the course of their careers, the members of our management team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships. This network has grown through the activities of our management team sourcing, acquiring and financing businesses, our management team’s relationships with sellers, financing sources and target management teams and the experience of our management team in executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions.
Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.
Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses and market and other uncertainties in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us.
Furthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.

We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following December 22, 2025, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” will have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Financial Position
With funds available for an initial business combination in the amount of approximately $19,827,884 as of December 31, 2022, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations other than the pursuit of our initial business combination, for an indefinite period of time following our initial public offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may use the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account following the closing for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we are targeting businesses with enterprise values that are greater than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, and, as a result, if the cash portion of the purchase price exceeds the amount available from the trust account, net of amounts needed to satisfy any redemptions by public stockholders, we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination. Subject 

10



to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities or through loans, advances or other indebtedness in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into. None of our sponsor, officers, directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, following our initial public offering and prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from issuing additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to receive funds from the trust account or vote on any initial business combination, on any pre-business combination activity or on any amendment to Article IX of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
For more information on the TriSalus Business Combination and the equity and financing arrangements associated therewith, please see "TriSalus Business Combination" above.
Sources of Target Businesses
Target business candidates are brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses also are brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus for our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and its affiliates, also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows, conferences or conventions. In addition, we have received a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their respective industry and business contacts as well as their affiliates. While we have not and do not anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our officers or directors are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the Company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Although none of our executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination, we do not have a policy that prohibits our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. We accrue $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support payable to our sponsor. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination candidate.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or making the initial business combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. While TriSalus is not affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, in the event we do not consummate the TriSalus Business Combination, and we seek to complete our initial business combination with an initial business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.

11



If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of an initial business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has then-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses , including TriSalus, that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and net of taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&A transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination (including with the assistance of financial advisors), we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% of fair market value test.
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
In evaluating a prospective business target, we conduct a due diligence review, which encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent ownership, management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that is available to us.
Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination with a target such as TriSalus Business Combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12




● | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we have and will continue to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the TriSalus management team, when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’ management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the management of the prospective target business may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the combined company cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with the combined company following our initial business combination, including the TriSalus Business Combination (in which two directors of the combined company will be designated by the Company), it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
​
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
​
Following our initial business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
​
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
​
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule (as is the case in the TriSalus Business Combination, as currently contemplated), or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.
​

​ | ​ | ​ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+---+------------
​ | | Whether 
​ | ​ | Stockholder
​ | ​ | Approval is
Type of Transaction | ​ | Required 
Purchase of assets | | No 
​ | ​ | ​ 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | | No 
​ | ​ | ​ 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | | No 
​ | ​ | ​ 
Merger of the company with a target | | Yes 

​
Under Nasdaq’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

● | we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by Nasdaq rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of Our Securities
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in privately-negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares or warrants our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of our initial business combination.
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or any of their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately-negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests tendered by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination. Such persons would select the stockholders from whom to acquire shares based on the number of shares available, the negotiated price per share and such other factors as any such person may deem relevant at the time of purchase. The price per share paid in any such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will be made only to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.

Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination (including the TriSalus Business Combination) at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately $10.11 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the initial business combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements.
Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with Nasdaq’s stockholder approval rules.
The requirement that we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares by one of the two methods listed above is contained in provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will apply whether or not we maintain our registration under the Exchange Act or our listing on Nasdaq. Such provisions may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock entitled to vote thereon.
If we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with a stockholder meeting, we will:

● | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

15



If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and, pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination, like the TriSalus Business Combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As of December 31, 2022, after accounting for the redemption of public shares in connection with the Extensions, the sponsor owns 76.2% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Accordingly, the sponsor will have the ability, voting on its own, to satisfy quorum requirements and to approve an initial business combination, including the TriSalus Business Combination, and none of our public shares will need to vote in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved. We intend to give not less than 10 days’ nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or whether they were a stockholder on the record date for the stockholder meeting held to approve the proposed transaction.
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will:

● | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination, which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares, which number will be based on the requirement that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
We intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. We believe that this will allow our transfer agent to efficiently process any redemptions without the need for further communication or action from the redeeming public stockholders, which could delay redemptions and result in additional administrative cost. If the proposed initial business combination is 

16



not approved and we continue to search for a target company, we will promptly return any certificates or shares delivered by public stockholders who elected to redeem their shares.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed initial business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed initial business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” Such restriction shall also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Delivering Stock Certificates in Connection with the Exercise of Redemption Rights
As described above, we intend to require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to, at the holder’s option, either deliver their stock certificates to our transfer agent or deliver their shares to our transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, prior to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. In the case of proxy materials, this date may be up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination. In addition, if we conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote, we intend to require a public stockholder seeking redemption of its public shares to also submit a written request for redemption to our transfer agent two business days prior to the vote in which the name of the beneficial owner of such shares is included. The proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have up to two business days prior to the vote on the initial business combination if we distribute proxy materials, or from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, as applicable, to submit or tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures disclosed in the proxy or tender offer materials, as applicable, its shares may not be redeemed. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the broker submitting or tendering shares a fee of approximately $100.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred 

17



regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to submit or tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
In the event the TriSalus Business Combination is not consummated, we may continue to try to complete an initial business combination with a different target until June 22, 2023.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only until June 22, 2023 to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the required time period.
Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination by June 22, 2023. However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time period.
Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 22, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we will only redeem our public shares so long as (after such redemption) our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of deferred underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time.

18



We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $ 153,563 held outside the trust account as of December 31, 2022, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account or Extension Contributions, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to enter into an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will consider whether competitive alternatives are reasonably available to the Company, and will only enter into an agreement with such third party if our management believes that such third party’s engagement would be in the best interests of the Company under the circumstances. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Withum, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our initial public offering will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account.
In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per share held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable; provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations, and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than $10.00 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties, including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

19



In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations, and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.
We seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to the amounts held outside the trust account (153,563 as of December 31, 2022) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors.
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by June 22, 2023 may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination by June 22, 2023, is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination by June 22, 2023, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month after our initial public offering and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.

20



Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest released to us to pay taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (A) modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by June 22, 2023 or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination by June 22, 2023, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the initial business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights as described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we have encountered competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

21



Employees
We have three officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time our officers devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the initial business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business, such as the TriSalus Business Combination. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. We have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following December 22, 2025, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of Class A common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ended December 31,2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an Accelerated filer, and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.
