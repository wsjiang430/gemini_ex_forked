Description of Business
 
Overview
 
Our business builds and operates FinTech Platforms-as-a-Service for digital currencies, digital securities tokens and digital assets. We anticipate that we will enable companies to digitise, sell and manage new or existing asset classes on blockchain infrastructure, transact in digital/cryptocurrencies (Payments, Rewards and Credit infrastructure), issue or create digital/crypto assets and/or manage their digital/crypto assets (NFTs, Fungible Cold Storage, Mining).
FinTech: Financial Technology
 
Fintech encompasses innovative technologies and infrastructure for the financial sector including sectors such as payments, banking, trading, funds and eCommerce.
 
Blockchain Technology
 
Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains typically a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. Functionally, a blockchain can serve as an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and a collusion of the network majority. Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system and decentralization can be achieved with a blockchain. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records and other record management activities, such as identity management, documenting provenance, digital asset registration and transaction processing.

Competition
 
We are in a novel business of providing services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies into their business operations. We compete with the following competitors:

● | ConsenSys
--+----------

 
ConsenSys is a venture production studio building decentralized applications and various developer and end-user tools for blockchain ecosystems, primarily focused on Ethereum. The ConsenSys “hub” coordinates, incubates, accelerates and spawns “spoke” ventures through development, resource sharing, acquisitions, investments and the formation of joint ventures. These spokes benefit from foundational components built by ConsenSys that enable new services and business models to be built on the blockchain. In addition to the development of internal projects and consulting work, ConsenSys is engaged in the identification, development and acquisition of talent and projects on an ongoing basis.

● | IBM
--+----

 
With thousands of technical experts, IBM is moving quickly into enterprise blockchain and claims the leading blockchain for business platform. This is primarily B2B focused work.
 
Many of our current and potential competitors may have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on product development, marketing and distribution. This advantage could enable our competitors to acquire larger market share and develop and offer more competitive products and services. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to develop our business plan. In the face of competition, we may not be successful in sufficient market share to make our business profitable.
 

● | Many of the large management consultancy firms are developing blockchain-specific practice areas including Accenture, Deloitte and Bain. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property and Technology
 
We do not currently own any intellectual property. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, patents, trademark and copyright laws to protect any intellectual property that we create, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights may be protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights.
 
We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. In addition, while we are not aware that our services or proprietary rights infringe the proprietary rights of third parties, we may receive notices from third parties asserting that we have infringed their patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights. Any such claims could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause service stoppages or lead us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements rather than disputing the merits of such claims. An adverse outcome in litigation or similar proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require expenditure of significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, require disputed rights to be licensed from others, or require us to cease operating our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
 
As we are still in the early stages of developing our business, we have devoted no substantial efforts to research and development within the last three fiscal years.
 
Government Regulation
 
Current and future legislation and rulemaking and other regulatory developments, including interpretations released by a regulatory authority, may impact the manner in which bitcoins or other cryptocurrency is viewed or treated for classification and clearing purposes. In particular, bitcoins and other cryptocurrency may not be excluded from the definition of “security” by regulatory rulemaking or interpretation requiring registration of all transactions, unless an exemption is available, including transacting in bitcoin or cryptocurrency amongst owners, and require registration of trading platforms as “exchanges” such as Coinsquare. We cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies under the law. If we determine not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, we may seek to cease certain of our operations or be subjected to fines, penalties and other governmental action. Any such action may adversely affect an investment in us. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our own account and harm investors.
 
We intend to comply with any applicable anti-money laundering or know your customer rules relating to tokens imposed by the SEC and Canadian securities regulators.
 
Investment Company Act of 1940 Considerations
 
We intend to conduct our operations so that we do not fall within, or are excluded from the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a company is deemed to be an “investment company” if it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We believe that we will not be considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 because we will not engage primarily or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, our new business is a services and development business that provides a turnkey set of services for companies to develop and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies into their business operations.
 
Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a company is deemed to be an “investment company” if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of our company’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the “40% test.” We intend to monitor our holdings and conduct operations so that on an unconsolidated basis we will comply with the 40% test. Nevertheless, because we may accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services, to the extent permitted under applicable law, we may acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of our company’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. In that case, we intend to rely on a safe harbor exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940 for so-called “transient investment companies.”
 
Consistent with the “transient investment company” safe harbor, we will have to reduce our holdings of “investment securities to not more than 40% of our total assets as soon as is reasonably possible and in any event within one year from the earlier of (i) the date on which we own securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the value of our company’s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis or (ii) the date on which we own or propose to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding 40% of the value of our company’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. This reduction could be attempted in a number of ways, including the disposition of securities and the acquisition of other assets that would not constitute investment securities for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. If we are required to sell securities, we may sell them sooner than we otherwise would, the sales may be at depressed prices, and we may never realize anticipated benefits from, or may incur losses on, those investments. We may not be able to sell some investments due to contractual or legal restrictions or the inability to locate a suitable buyer. We may also incur tax liabilities when we sell our assets. If we decide to try to acquire additional assets that would not constitute investment securities, we may not be able to identify and acquire suitable assets. If these steps do not achieve a sufficient reduction in our holdings of investment securities within the prescribed period, we will be forced to liquidate some of our securities holdings and invest the proceeds in U.S. government securities and cash items, with a potential loss.
 
Because we can rely on the “transient investment company” safe harbor only once during any three-year period, we may not accept tokens, coins or equity in payment for our services during the period that this safe harbor is not available.
 
If we become obligated to register our company as an investment company, we would have to comply with a variety of substantive requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940 imposing, among other things:
 

● | limitations on capital structure; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | restrictions on specified investments; 
● | prohibitions on transactions with affiliates; and 
● | compliance with reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy disclosure and other rules and regulations that would significantly change our operations. 

 
If we were required to register our company as an investment company but failed to do so, we would be prohibited from engaging in our business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business, all of which would have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Employees
 
As at March 17, 2023, we have two executive officers, Scott Gallagher, who is our president, and Swapan Kakumanu, who is our chief financial officer, secretary, and treasurer and no employees. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research. We also employ consultants on an as-needed-basis to provide specific expertise in areas of product design and development and other business functions including marketing and accounting. We intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus.
