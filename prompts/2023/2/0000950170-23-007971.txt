Overview

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery and development of a new generation of immuno-oncology therapeutics for people living with cancer. We leverage our deep understanding of tumor immunology and immunosuppressive pathways to design novel product candidates with the aim of restoring the immune response against cancer. Our innovative pipeline includes two clinical-stage programs targeting novel, validated immuno-oncology pathways. Each of our therapies in development has optimized pharmacologic properties designed to improve clinical outcomes.

Our lead antibody product candidate, EOS-448, also known as GSK4428859A, is an antagonist of TIGIT, or T-cell immunoreceptor with lg and ITIM domains, an immune checkpoint with multiple mechanisms of action. EOS-448 was selected for its affinity for TIGIT, its potency and its potential to engage the Fc gamma receptor, or FcγR, to activate dendritic cells, natural killer cells and macrophages and to promote cytokine release, activation of antigen presenting cells and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or ADCC, activity. In 2020, we started an open-label Phase 1/2a clinical trial of EOS-448 in adult cancer patients with advanced solid tumors. In April 2021, we reported preliminary safety, pharmacokinetic, engagement and pharmacodynamic data, indicating target engagement and early evidence of clinical activity as a single agent. In September 2021, we dosed the first patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of EOS-448 in combination with pembrolizumab and in combination with our A2AR antagonist inupadenant in patients with solid tumors.

On June 11, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, iTeos Belgium S.A., and GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property (No. 4) Limited, or GSK, executed a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the GSK Collaboration Agreement, which became effective on July 26, 2021. Pursuant to the GSK Collaboration Agreement, we granted GSK a license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products comprised of or containing EOS-448, which license is exclusive in all countries outside of the United States and co-exclusive, with iTeos, in the United States. GSK and iTeos intend to develop EOS-448 in combination, including with other oncology assets of GSK, and iTeos and GSK will jointly own the intellectual property created under the GSK Collaboration Agreement that covers such combinations. In partnership with GSK, we are enrolling patients with first line, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a randomized Phase 2 trial assessing the doublet of GSK's anti-PD-1 (Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly)) with EOS-448. In addition, we are enrolling patients with first-line advanced or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for the Phase 2 expansion part of the trial assessing the doublet of GSK’s dostarlimab with EOS-448. We and GSK continue to explore two novel triplets in selected advanced solid tumors both in Phase 1b trials: EOS-448 with dostarlimab and GSK’s investigational anti-CD96 antibody, and EOS-448 with dostarlimab and GSK’s anti-PVRIG.
 
Based on favorable preclinical data generated in collaboration with Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, we are also enrolling patients in an open-label dose-escalation/expansion Phase 1/2 trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary activity of EOS-448 as monotherapy and in combination with Bristol Myers Squibb’s iberdomide - a novel, potent oral cereblon E3 ligase modulator (CELMoD®) compound with enhanced tumoricidal and immune-stimulatory effects compared with immunomodulatory (IMiD®) agents - with or without dexamethasone, in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
 
We are also advancing inupadenant, a next-generation adenosine A2A receptor antagonist tailored to overcome the specific adenosine-mediated immunosuppression found in tumor microenvironment, into proof-of concept trials in several indications following encouraging single-agent activity in Phase 1. We are investigating inupadenant in an open-label multi-arm Phase 1/2a clinical trial in adult cancer patients with advanced solid tumors. The single-agent dose-escalation and expansion portions of our Phase 1/2a clinical trial of inupadenant have demonstrated durable monotherapy antitumor activity in some patients with advanced solid tumors and safety consistent with previously reported results. As part of this monotherapy assessment of inupadenant, we identified a potential predictive biomarker and we have completed enrolling patients in the biomarker cohort of the ongoing Phase 1b/2a trial. We confirmed a partial response using inupadenant in monotherapy in a patient who had the highest level of the biomarker that we have recorded. We are also enrolling patients in the dose ranging part (Part 1) of an ongoing two-part Phase 2 trial in post-IO metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to evaluate the combination of inupadenant with platinum-doublet chemotherapy compared to standard

platinum-doublet chemotherapy. We have completed enrollment in the safety evaluation portion of the clinical trial of inupadenant in combination with chemotherapy and with pembrolizumab, as well as the monotherapy expansion cohort in prostate cancer. We have completed enrollment in the Phase 2a trial evaluating inupadenant in combination with pembrolizumab in post-PD-1 melanoma and have decided to prioritize development of inupadenant in our ongoing study in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in patients with chemo-naïve NSCLC as we have determined that the post-PD-1 melanoma setting is not a path to accelerated approval. In addition, we are evaluating a salt form of inupadenant in a Phase 1 study.
 
In September 2021, we nominated a product candidate, EOS301984, or EOS-984, which targets a new mechanism in the adenosine pathway for Investigational New Drug, or IND, enabling studies. EOS-984 has the potential to fully reverse adenosine immune suppression, as a monotherapy and in combination with inupadenant and other standards of care. We expect to initiate clinical studies for EOS-984 in mid-2023.

We began our research and development activities as a spin-off of Ludwig Cancer Research and have built significant expertise in designing novel cancer immunotherapies. Our internal research and development team has extensive expertise in tumor immunology, characterization of immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, pharmacology and translational medicine. We have also built discovery capabilities to develop both small molecules and antibodies with differentiated and optimized product profiles for targets validated by a strong scientific rationale. We continue to progress research programs focused on additional targets that complement our TIGIT and adenosine pathway programs or address additional immunosuppressive pathways. Our expertise also allows us to integrate a biomarker-rich strategy into our clinical programs to measure the activity of a product candidate in patients, seek to optimize combination agents and identify patients we deem most likely to benefit from treatment.
 Our pipeline
The following chart summarizes our current and expected development of our pipeline of therapeutic candidates during 2023.





      
Objectives and Business Strategy
Our vision is to transform the treatment of people living with cancer by creating a broad portfolio of immuno-oncology therapies targeting major mechanisms of immunosuppression on in the tumor microenvironment. The key pillars of our strategy to achieve our vision include:
•Advance the development of our clinical candidates toward registration. In collaboration with GSK, we aim to exploit the broad potential of TIGIT inhibition and advance EOS-448, our FcγR engaging anti-TIGIT antibody, through clinical development and regulatory approval. For the adenosine pathway, our goal is to build upon the differentiated profile of inupadenant and EOS-984 to advance these programs through clinical development and regulatory approval. 
 •Leverage our deep understanding of immune pathways and the tumor microenvironment to identify and develop additional novel product candidates. Since our inception, we have established extensive knowledge in immuno-metabolism, characterization of the immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment, pharmacology and translational medicine. We will continue to apply our expertise in understanding and targeting immunosuppressive cells and mechanisms of resistance within the tumor microenvironment. Once these new targets are validated, we will use our expertise to develop differentiated clinical candidates to progress in clinical development for the treatment of cancer. 
 •Maximize the value of our product candidates and pipeline by selectively entering into strategic collaborations. We seek to establish collaborative relationships that will provide us with access to capital, opportunities and/or expertise to move our clinical products toward commercialization. In June 2021, we entered into the GSK Collaboration Agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize EOS-448. Under the GSK Collaboration Agreement, GSK made an upfront payment of $625.0 million to us, and we are also eligible to receive up to $1.45 billion in milestone payments, contingent upon the EOS-448 program achieving certain development and commercial milestones. By combining forces with GSK’s and their global reach and leading pipeline in the TIGIT/CD226 pathway, this collaboration expands and accelerates our ability to bring EOS-448 to patients globally in multiple indications. In addition, we have and may in the future enter into collaborations that grant us access to certain compounds owned by third parties to enable therapeutic combinations that could enhance the clinical and commercial potential of our product candidates. For example, we entered into a non-exclusive, clinical supply agreement with Merck & Co, or Merck, to evaluate inupadenant in combination with pembrolizumab and with Bristol Myers Squibb to evaluate EOS-448 in combination with iberdomide. 
 •Maintain a strong culture of innovation and putting patients first. We will continue to nurture our culture, which is based on scientific innovation, collaboration, excellence and putting patients first in everything we do. We believe that our presence in the United States and Belgium is a strategic advantage that enhances our ability to attract global talent and remain at the forefront of innovation in the field of immuno-oncology.
 The promise of immuno-oncology 
In recent years, the treatment of cancer has been reshaped by the promise of immuno-oncology therapies. These therapies work to harness the patients’ own immune system to attack their own cancer tissue. The most widely used of these interventions are the immune checkpoint inhibitors, or CPIs, with anti-PD-1 antibodies being the most successful immunotherapies. Immune checkpoints are proteins on certain immune cells that regulate the activation, often functioning as on-off switches, of effector cells. The success of these CPIs has demonstrated the potential of harnessing the immune system to treat cancer and increased understanding of the sophisticated mechanisms by which cancer evades the immune system.
 
Our drug discovery efforts are dedicated to understanding immune resistance pathways with the specific goal of generating differentiated product candidates that restore the immune response against cancer. We currently have two clinical-stage product candidates, EOS-448 and inupadenant, each targeting a key mechanism which may inhibit an effective antitumor immune response: the novel checkpoint TIGIT/CD226 pathway, and the adenosine pathway, respectively. We believe that both product candidates have the potential to increase patient responses to immunotherapy, including in patients resistant to currently approved CPIs. We are also using our deep understanding of critical immune resistance pathways to identify new targets and generate additional product candidates that have the potential to be complementary to our current cancer therapies.


EOS-448

Highlights of EOS-448
 1.Clinical proof of concept of anti-TIGIT antibodies. EOS-448 is an antibody specifically designed to target TIGIT, a receptor expressed on immune cells, particularly tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs. Its main ligands play both inhibitory and stimulatory roles in regulating immune response and are highly expressed in tumors, where they have been shown to mediate immunosuppression. In the TIGIT field, two recent randomized Phase 2 trials in non-small cell lung cancer of other companies that demonstrated clinical benefit of a-TIGIT treatment and upcoming readouts of other companies uniquely position anti-TIGIT antibodies as a promising next generation cancer immunotherapy.
 2.An anti-TIGIT with strong antagonist potency. EOS-448 is a recombinant, fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against human TIGIT that we selected for clinical development based on its favorable characteristics, including affinity, competition with TIGIT ligands CD155 and CD112, cross-reactivity to TIGIT in non-human primates, functionality and suitability for development.
 
We produced biosimilar versions of anti-TIGIT antibodies, in development by other companies, based on sequences from the patents of Mereo, Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Arcus and compared them to EOS-448 in preclinical assays. As compared to these antibodies, EOS-448 has similar or higher binding affinity for CD8+ T cells and ability to prevent the interaction between TIGIT and CD155 ligand at minimal concentrations of the antibody. EOS-448 also exhibited stronger potency as determined using an IL-2 promoter-dependent functional assay. This is the result of our screening studies, during which we observed that functional activity can be independent of affinity, and selection of a clone that was optimized for both.

In preclinical models, we also showed that a surrogate anti-TIGIT antibody, sharing similar characteristics as EOS-448 but active in mouse, delayed tumor growth and caused tumor regression both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer therapies, including anti-PD-1 antibodies.

We believe these properties could translate into superior clinical benefit of EOS-448 as compared to other anti-TIGIT antibodies in development.
 3.An FcγR-activating anti-TIGIT antibody to restore anti-tumor activity via multiple mechanisms.  EOS-448 is designed to restore immune responses through multiple mechanisms. First, EOS-448 is designed to block the binding of the ligands, CD155 and CD112, to TIGIT, which frees these ligands to bind to the stimulatory receptor, CD226, expressed both on NK and T cells, resulting in activation of these immune cells and in immune-mediated killing of tumor cells. Second, as the antibody has been designed as a fully functional IgG1, EOS-448 can engage Fcγ receptors expressed on dendritic cells, natural killers, and macrophages leading to pro-inflammatory signal and enhanced immune activation. Third, these activated macrophages and NK cells can induce antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and directly kill the cells expressing the highest level of TIGIT in the tumor microenvironment, which are the immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the terminally exhausted T cells that are detrimental to an effective antitumor immune response. With those multiple mechanisms of action, EOS-448 is well suited to improve the balance of effector versus suppressive immune cells and restore the antitumor immune response, particularly in combination with other immunotherapies.
 4.EOS-448 demonstrates strong target engagement and early sign of activity in patients. EOS-448 is currently under clinical development and early clinical trials have demonstrated strong target engagement in patients treated with different concentration of the drug. Early clinical data suggest that proliferation markers are increased in T cells of treated patients while suppressive regulatory T cells are strongly depleted from the blood and in the tumor after the initial dosing with EOS-448. In addition, multiple patients have experienced prolonged disease stabilization and some regression of tumor size was observed in subjects treated with the drug as single agent. EOS-448 is currently tested in multiple studies and in multiple combinations with the goal of expanding its antitumor potential. 
 

    
We believe that EOS-448 has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to patients across a wide array of tumors. Combination experiments in preclinical models suggest that combining EOS-448 with a number of other immuno-oncology agents and chemotherapy regimens may lead to improved outcomes.

Inupadenant

Inupadenant is an A2AR antagonist that we engineered to specifically inhibit the immunosuppressive activity of adenosine found in the tumor microenvironment. Hypoxia and cell necrosis in the tumor lead to the release of ATP, which is converted to adenosine by adenosine producing enzymes. Adenosine primarily exerts its immunosuppressive effects through the A2AR, a receptor found on a broad range of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Inupadenant is designed to release adenosine-driven immunosuppression, ultimately allowing T cells to kill their tumor targets. Inupadenant, unlike other A2AR antagonists in IO, has been specifically designed to maintain potency even in the very high concentrations of adenosine found in tumor tissue. We believe that elevated levels of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment may be a modulator of resistance to current cancer therapies, including both CPIs and chemotherapy. High activity of soluble CD73 is associated with poor overall survival and PFS in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 CPI. An association between high adenosine blood concentrations and lack of response to nivolumab has been shown in a clinical trial of renal cell cancer patients conducted by others. In this trial, patients who failed to respond to nivolumab had significantly higher blood adenosine levels than those who responded, both at baseline (158% higher) and at four weeks after initiation of treatment (138% higher). Patients with baseline adenosine levels in the top quartile also had a significantly worse PFS. These data further support our belief that adenosine plays an important role in resistance to CPIs such as nivolumab. Additional data support a potential role in chemotherapy-induced resistance, as chemotherapy has been shown in some cases to increase the production of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment and some chemotherapeutics induce adenosine-mediated immunosuppression that may limit the efficacy of these therapies.

Differentiation of inupadenant

We believe inupadenant has three key characteristics that provide the molecule with a unique profile and potential advantages in clinical settings when compared to other A2AR antagonists currently in development:

1.High affinity for A2AR and insurmountable antagonism. Adenosine is widely accepted as a driver of immunosuppression in cancer tissue. What is less appreciated is the fact that the immunosuppression is driven by very high concentrations of adenosine – concentrations that can be in the high micromolar range. To overcome these very high concentrations we have designed inupadenant to be what is 


known as an insurmountable antagonist. This means that the drug is capable of potently blocking the A2A receptor at any concentration of adenosine. Inupadenant achieves this through a combination of affinity and an extended residence time, the length of time the drug remains bound to its receptor. In our in vitro studies, we assessed this characteristic in functional T cell assays and compared inupadenant to a range of competitor antagonists. In these assays, we observed that at low adenosine concentrations, inupadenant was the most potent antagonist of the A2AR antagonists we tested, and most notably, when compared to other antagonists developed by competitors, the potency of inupadenant was not reduced at the high adenosine concentrations typically found in the tumor microenvironment.
2.Inupadenant has higher selectivity for A2AR than other antagonists in clinical development. Because A2AR is the primary adenosine receptor on immune cells, we believe that the high specificity of inupadenant will enable it to have potent effects on immune cell function in solid tumors and hematological malignancies, while avoiding potential adverse effects that may be associated with inhibition of other subtypes of adenosine receptors with broader expression profiles. We conducted a study showing the IC50 for inhibition of cAMP production in HEK cells overexpressing one of the four adenosine receptors, comparing inupadenant and three other adenosine antagonists currently in development. Inupadenant was the most potent A2AR antagonist among other antagonists as demonstrated by the very low concentrations of drug required to give a 50% response in a functional assay. Higher concentrations were required to give the same effect on other adenosine receptors, further supporting the high selectivity of inupadenant.
 3.Inupadenant is designed not to cross the blood brain barrier. Unlike first generation A2AR antagonists, we designed inupadenant specifically to avoid penetration to the CNS through crossing of the blood-brain barrier. In preclinical models, inupadenant displayed less than 1% blood-brain barrier penetration, and, accordingly, we believe it is designed to minimize the potential for adverse CNS effects. 
 

We are focused on the direct target for adenosine, its receptor, and we chose A2AR as it is the most highly expressed in relevant immune cell populations and one of the receptors with high affinity for the adenosine, rather than targeting upstream enzymes that are involved in production of adenosine. We selected A2AR as the target for inupadenant because we believe it is a key actor that mediates the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine regardless of the source of adenosine production.

Potential broader opportunity for inupadenant
We are evaluating potential predictors of response and potential PD biomarkers in pre- and post-treatment tumor samples. These biomarkers include the expression of A2AR and adenosine-producing enzymes within the tumor, the presence of immune cells within the tumor and several tumor gene signatures, including an immune gene signature. We believe the biomarker findings from our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial provide insight into the mechanism of action of inupadenant, which we anticipate will inform our selection of indications, and may allow us to identify patients more likely to benefit from inupadenant. We will also be guided by our evaluation of the

expression of A2AR and adenosine-producing enzymes, such as CD73, TNAP and PAP in various tumor types. We believe inupadenant has the potential to provide clinical benefit across many indications.
 

Our Preclinical Novel Adenosine-Pathway Inhibitor Program

We have developed significant expertise in tumor immunology and the tumor microenvironment, which we are exploiting to expand our pipeline. For example, by characterizing the impact of high concentrations of adenosine on immune cells, we have identified a novel mechanism within the adenosine pathway responsible for inhibiting the proliferation of T cells in high adenosine concentrations that can be found in some tumors. In preclinical studies, addition of ATP as a source of adenosine at a concentration of 100µM completely blocked CD8+ T cell proliferation in vitro. The addition of an inhibitor to the novel target restored proliferation and could further enhance cytokine secretion in combination with inupadenant.
 
In September 2021, we nominated a product candidate, EOS-984, targeting a novel mechanism in the adenosine pathway for IND enabling studies. EOS-984 has the potential to fully reverse adenosine immune suppression, as a monotherapy and in combination with inupadenant and other standards of care. We expect to initiate clinical studies for EOS-984 in mid-2023.

Collaborations and Licenses

Collaboration and License Agreement with GSK
 
On June 11, 2021, our wholly owned subsidiary, iTeos Belgium S.A., and GSK executed the GSK Collaboration Agreement, which became effective on July 26, 2021. Pursuant to the GSK Collaboration Agreement, we agreed to grant GSK a license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products comprised of or containing EOS-448, referred to as Licensed Products, which license is exclusive in all countries outside of the United States and co-exclusive, with iTeos, in the United States.
 
Under the GSK Collaboration Agreement, GSK made an upfront payment of $625.0 million to us. Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to $1.45 billion in milestone payments, contingent upon the EOS-448 program achieving certain development and commercial milestones, none of which have been achieved to date. Within the collaboration, GSK and we agreed to share responsibility and costs for the global development of EOS-448 and will jointly commercialize and equally split profits in the United States. Outside of the United States, GSK will receive an exclusive license for commercialization, and we are eligible to receive tiered double digit royalty payments up to 20% during a customary royalty term. We and GSK intend to develop EOS-448 in combination with certain other oncology assets of GSK, and we will jointly own the intellectual property created under the GSK Collaboration Agreement that covers such combinations together with GSK. Subject to certain limited exceptions, other than under the GSK Collaboration Agreement, we and GSK each agreed not to, alone or with or for any Third Party, (i) develop a monospecific, monoclonal antibody that inhibits or is an antagonist of TIGIT through direct physical interaction for a period of time following the first regulatory approval of a Licensed Product in the United States, Germany, France, United Kingdom, Spain, or Italy or (ii) commercialize any such a product during the term of the GSK Collaboration Agreement. Unless terminated earlier in certain specified circumstances, the GSK Collaboration Agreement will continue for so long as we and GSK are commercializing Licensed Products in the United States.
 Collaboration with Adimab
In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Adimab, LLC, or Adimab. We refer to this agreement, as amended, as the Original Adimab Agreement. On February 22, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Adimab Agreement (the Amended Adimab Agreement and together with the Original Adimab Agreement, the Adimab Agreement). Adimab has developed an antibody discovery and optimization technology platform. This collaboration enables our research and development efforts on discovery and optimization of new antibodies against immuno-oncology targets we may identify.
Under the terms of the Adimab Agreement, Adimab has granted us a worldwide, non-exclusive research license for a one-year research term period and evaluation period for up to 18 months per research program. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform our research activities under the Adimab Agreement and, if we exercise our right to obtain a development and commercialization license, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue development and commercialization of a product directed to the

applicable target. Under the terms of the Adimab Agreement, we granted Adimab a worldwide, non-exclusive license under all of our patents and know-how that are reasonably necessary or useful for Adimab to perform its research activities under the Adimab Agreement.
Payment terms to Adimab include a one-time upfront technology access fee in the tens of thousands and payments for research support. Adimab is entitled to additional fees of up to a maximum of $0.4 million on a program-by-program basis for the achievement of certain technical milestones, one of which was met, and we paid $0.2 million in April 2017. Upon our exercise of an option for an exclusive development and commercialization license, with respect to a target, we are required to make a low single digit million-dollar payment to Adimab for each exercised option. For example, in August 2018, we paid a $1.0 million nonrefundable fee to exercise an option to acquire certain licenses from Adimab. One of the antibodies licensed under this agreement is what we now refer to as EOS-448. In addition, on a per target basis, we may be required to pay development, regulatory and commercial milestones totaling up to an aggregate of $42.8 million for the first three products and additional milestone payments up to $13.5 million for each additional product. We will pay Adimab low to mid-single-digit royalties on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, on worldwide net product sales of licensed products. Royalties are payable on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of (i) expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent right that covers such licensed product in such country, and (ii) ten years following the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. To date, we have paid a total of $5.4 million to Adimab pursuant to the collaboration agreement.

The Amended Adimab Agreement specifies different milestone payments for new products that are derived from research programs beginning after February 22, 2021 (New Products). For New Products, on a per target basis, we may be required to pay development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate of $45.8 million for the first three products and additional milestone payments up to $14.5 million for each additional product. Royalty percentages for New Products are slightly different than for original products. There were no other significant changes to the terms in the original Adimab Agreement as a result of the Amended Adimab Agreement.
 Adimab controls the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the intellectual property that it licenses to us under the Adimab Agreement. We have the right to enforce such licensed intellectual property against infringement if the infringement is competitive with our licensed products and Adimab does not pursue enforcement. We control the filing, prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the intellectual property we license to Adimab under the Adimab Agreement and all program antibody patents.
The term of the Adimab Agreement will continue until the last to expire royalty term on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis if we exercise our option, or in the event no option is exercised, the conclusion of the last-to-expire evaluation term, unless terminated earlier by either party. Each party has the right to terminate the Adimab Agreement due to the other party’s uncured material breach or our abandonment of the product.
WuXi manufacturing agreement
In March 2017, we entered into a biologics master services agreement with WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited, or WuXi, which we refer to as the WuXi Agreement. The WuXi Agreement provides for IND-enabling CMC development and GMP manufacturing of EOS-448 on a work order basis. Under the WuXi Agreement, we are obligated to pay WuXi a service fee in the amount specified in each work order associated with the agreement for the provision of services. If we manufacture all of our commercial supplies of EOS-448 with a manufacturer other than WuXi, we must pay to WuXi either a low single-digit royalty fee on global net sales or a one-time milestone payment in the low tens of millions.
The WuXi Agreement terminates one year after the date on which the last work order has expired or been terminated, unless terminated earlier. The term of each work order terminates upon completion of the services under such work order, unless terminated earlier.
Competition
Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and established collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of cancer therapies. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical

and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue immune-oncology treatments. For example, there are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Gilead, Incyte, Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche/Genentech.
For our anti-TIGIT antibody, EOS-448, we are aware of several pharmaceutical companies developing antibodies against this target, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Mereo Biopharma Group plc, Roche/Genentech, Beigene, Ltd. (with partner Novartis), Arcus (with partner Gilead), Agenus, Seagen, Innovent (with partner Eli Lilly), Merck KGaA, Junshi and Compugen Ltd. To our knowledge, no anti-TIGIT antibodies have been approved for commercial sale, and the most advanced antibodies are in Phase 3 clinical trials.
 For our small molecule antagonist of A2AR, inupadenant, we are aware of several other companies that are developing other adenosine receptor antagonists, including AstraZeneca, Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Merck KGaA, Incyte, Arcus (with partner Gilead) and Novartis. To our knowledge, there are no adenosine receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of cancer and the most advanced such selective A2AR antagonists are in Phase 2 clinical trials.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy, or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payors may encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and a gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive. If we seek to acquire or license products, we will face substantial competition from a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have. These more established companies may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage.
Manufacturing and supply
We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities nor have any plans to do so in the foreseeable future. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, or in the case of EOS-448, our collaborator, GSK, to develop a suitable manufacturing

process at scale and produce our small molecule and biologic product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates.
To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, and drug product for our product candidates from single-source third party CMOs, including WuXi. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates to ensure continuity of supply.
We maintain agreements with our manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.
We expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop.
Commercialization
Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the United States to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists who are the key specialists in treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Outside the United States, we expect to enter into distribution and other marketing arrangements with third parties for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval. With respect to EOS-448, in June of 2021 we entered into a collaboration agreement with GSK in which we agreed to collaborate with GSK on commercialization efforts for EOS-448 and related Licensed Products in the United States, and we have granted GSK a license to develop and commercialize EOS-448 and related Licensed Products outside of the United States.
 We also plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. The responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with researchers and practitioners in relevant fields of medicine.
Intellectual property
As of January 1, 2023, we have two issued United States patents, one issued European patent, and over thirty pending applications in the United States and throughout the world in our TIGIT program portfolio. The patents and pending applications in our TIGIT program portfolio include claims covering EOS-448, its therapeutic use, and manufacture. Not including any potential patent term extension, the issued United States and European patents have a natural expiration date in 2038 and the pending applications in the portfolio, should they grant, have expiration dates ranging from 2038 to 2040.
We also have three issued United States Patents, one issued Australian Patent, one issued European Patent, as well as several other issued patents globally, and over fifty pending applications (including Patent Cooperation Treaty applications) in our A2AR program portfolio both in the United States and throughout the world. The patents and pending applications in our A2AR program portfolio include claims covering inupadenant, such as composition of matter, formulations, methods of treatment, and processes of manufacture. Not including any potential patent term extension, the issued patents have natural expiration dates ranging from 2038 to 2039 and the pending applications in the portfolio, should they grant, have expiration dates ranging from 2038 to 2042.
Government regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries and jurisdictions, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of drugs and biologics such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs in the United States and in foreign countries and ensuring subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

In the United States, where we are initially focusing our product development, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidates are early-stage and have not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.
Our product candidates must be approved for therapeutic indications by the FDA through either a new drug application, or NDA, or a biologics license application, or BLA, process before they may be marketed in the United States. An NDA is a request for approval to market a new drug for one or more specified indications, and a BLA is a request for approval to market a new biologic for one or more specified indications. The process generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND that must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
 •approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after completion of all pivotal trials; 
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA or BLA; 
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to file the application for review; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure and preserve the drug or biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency; 
 •potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States. 
 
The failure to comply with the applicable requirements in the United States at any time during the product development process, including preclinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process, or post-approval, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions.
 Preclinical and clinical trials
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, and plans for the proposed clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin.
The FDA may, at any time during the initial 30-day IND review period or while clinical trials are ongoing under the IND, impose a partial or complete clinical hold based on concerns for patient safety and/or noncompliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay a proposed clinical study or cause suspension of an ongoing study until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed, and the FDA has notified the

company that investigations may proceed. Imposition of a clinical hold could cause significant delays or difficulties in completing planned clinical studies in a timely manner.
 A separate submission to an existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development of a product candidate, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB also approves the informed consent information that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, including GCP. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk to subjects or on other grounds, such as lack of efficacy.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. The FDA may accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, the foreign data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice, the studies have been performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support NDAs and BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap.
•Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These trials are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional data from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.


IND sponsors must submit annual reports on the progress of investigations under the IND to FDA and submit IND safety reports to FDA when certain serious and unexpected adverse reactions and certain other safety issues occur.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the drug or biological characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate.
FDA review process
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug, or the safety, purity and potency of the investigational biologic, to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, certain NDAs and BLAs and certain supplements to an NDA or BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug or biological product that includes a new active ingredient or clinically active component, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan within 60 days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements, under specified circumstances. PREA does not generally apply to a drug or biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted, PREA requirements are applicable to original applications for a new active ingredient that is intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and is directed at a molecular target that the FDA determines to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer, regardless of whether the drug is for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 The FDA has 60 days after submission of an NDA or BLA to conduct an initial review to determine whether it is sufficient to accept for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the application. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original NDA or BLA filed for priority review. A major amendment to an NDA or BLA submitted at any time during the review cycle, including in response to a request from the FDA, may extend the goal date by three months The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority NDAs or BLAs.
The FDA may refer an application for a drug or biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes

and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition for approving the NDA or BLA to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the NDA or BLA, and the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA or BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. The FDA will not approve an application until it determines that the issues identified in the complete response letter have been addressed.
Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan designation and exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation, or ODD, to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the NDA or BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and priority review.

A new drug or biologic is eligible for Fast Track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast Track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
In addition, a new drug or biological product may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic, alone or in combination with or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with Fast Track, or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible priority review. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness over available therapies. For original NDAs and BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and priority review do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process. Each of the designations may also be rescinded if a product no longer meets the program’s criteria.
 Accelerated approval pathway
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
For drugs granted accelerated approval, FDA generally requires sponsors to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies with due diligence, failure to confirm a clinical benefit during the post-approval studies, or dissemination of false or misleading promotional materials would allow the FDA to withdraw the product approval on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval are subject to prior review by the FDA unless FDA informs the applicant otherwise.
 FDA approval of companion diagnostics
In August 2014, the FDA issued final guidance clarifying the requirements that will apply to approval of therapeutic products and in vitro companion diagnostics. According to the guidance, for novel drugs and biologics, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding therapeutic should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product’s labeling. Approval or clearance

of the companion diagnostic device will ensure that the device has been adequately evaluated and has adequate performance characteristics in the intended population.
Under the FDCA, in vitro diagnostics, including companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution.
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the product candidate to obtain pre-market approval, or PMA, simultaneously with approval of the therapeutic product candidate. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory and reporting requirements.
 U.S. post-approval requirements for drugs and biologics
Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations applicable to drugs and biologics, including those prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have violated FDA regulatory requirements, including improperly promoting off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information; 
 •fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
 •holds on clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. 
 
In addition, drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to

periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
 U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date and only those patents covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Examples of applications that may require new clinical investigations essential to approval and receive three-year exclusivity include applications for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
A drug or biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “written request” for such a study.

Biosimilars and exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar

product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. However, since the passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, including laws governing pharmacy practices, which are state regulated, to regulate the use of biosimilars.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. The ultimate impact, implementation, and regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA remain subject to significant uncertainty.
Other healthcare laws
Our business operations and any current or future arrangements with third-party payors, physicians, other healthcare providers, patients and other individuals and organizations in the health care industry may expose us to healthcare and other laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we develop, market, sell and distribute any drugs for which we may obtain marketing approval. In the United States, federal laws include, without limitation, the following (some of which may be implicated only if we have an approved product).
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
 •The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, or FCA, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false, fictitious or fraudulent; knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA; 
 •The federal civil monetary penalties laws, which impose civil fines for, among other things, the offering or transfer or remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; 
 •The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 •HIPAA, as amended, and its implementing regulations, which establish privacy and security standards applicable to certain health care providers and other entities and their business associates that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information;
 •federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs;


•the so-called “federal sunshine” law or Open Payments, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians, certain non-physician practitioners and teaching hospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public; and
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and that potentially harm consumers.

Also, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply to claims reimbursed by private payors as well as government programs regardless of reimbursement. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, impose specific restrictions on interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Other state laws may require pharmaceutical companies to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. The distribution of drugs and biological products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. Finally, there are state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Many of these laws and regulations also contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.

Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Given the breadth of the laws and regulations, limited guidance for certain laws and regulations and evolving government interpretations of the laws and regulations, governmental authorities may possibly conclude that our business practices may not comply with such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
 Coverage and reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients and providers generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. Obtaining coverage and an adequate reimbursement may prove challenging for new products as such products may need to demonstrate their relative cost effectiveness and gain market acceptance.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of products have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products, which could further limit a company’s revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage and reimbursement may vary across payors. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare reform
The U.S. government and individual states have been aggressively pursuing healthcare reform designed to impact delivery of, and/or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives intended to reduce the cost of

healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA, which, among other things, expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual health insurance mandate; included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs; imposed an annual fee on manufacturers of branded drugs; and expanded government enforcement authority. We face uncertainties because there have been, and may be additional, federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The ACA has also been subject to judicial challenge. For example, in June 2021, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA on the grounds that the states and individuals that brought the challenge did not have standing.
 Beyond the ACA, there have been ongoing legislative and administrative reform efforts that affect pricing or payment for drug products or the healthcare industry more generally. Drug pricing and payment reform was a focus of the Trump Administration and has been a focus of the Biden Administration. For example, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap on Medicaid drug rebate program rebates effective January 1, 2024. As another example, in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 contains various drug pricing and payment provisions. Among other provisions, the IRA imposes a yearly cap ($2,000 in 2025) on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs in Medicare Part D, implements a new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount drug program in 2025; requires manufacturers to pay a rebate to the federal government if prices for single-source drugs and biologicals covered under Medicare Part B and nearly all covered drugs under Part D increase faster than the rate of inflation and, starting in 2026, creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals without generic or biosimilar competition will be limited by a cap that is defined by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price.
 Some of the health care reform changes have been and may continue to be subject to legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed, and the IRA further delayed implementation of the rule until January 1, 2032. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could negatively affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale.
 On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, but the manufacturer must develop an internal policy and respond to patient requests according to that policy.
 Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives. For example, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, may develop new payment and delivery models, such as bundled payment models. In addition, in recent years, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
In addition, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
In addition, other legislative changes have been adopted that could have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, or the Budget Control Act, includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit, including reductions in Medicare payments to providers through 2031 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022). Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or any significant taxes or fees imposed as part of any broader deficit reduction effort or legislative

replacement to the Budget Control Act, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.
 Outside the United States, ensuring coverage and adequate payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control in many countries and pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. For example, the domestic laws of various European Union (EU), may restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and control, both directly and indirectly, the prices of medicinal products for human use. Some EU Member States provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some EU Member States may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies or standard of care in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Other U.S. environmental, health and safety laws and regulations
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
We may be subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.
We maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. However, we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us.
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling or packaging; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
European Union drug development
In the EU, our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. The EU clinical trials regulatory framework is currently in the process of transitioning to an updated regime. Although the old regime, the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or the CTD, sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework the EU Member States applied the provisions of the CTD differently. This led to significant variations in the Member State regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be authorized in each of the EU Member States where the trial is to be conducted by the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and an Ethics Committee, or EC, in each EU Member State where the trial is to be conducted must have issued a favorable opinion on the trial. Under the old regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the EU Member State where they occurred.
As of January 31, 2022, Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 on clinical trials (the CTR), came into effect, and with it, the launch of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS), the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials.

The CTR is directly applicable in all EU Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each EU Member State). The CTR has simplified the approval process for clinical trials to be carried out in the EU. Rather than applying for a clinical trial authorization in each EU Member State where the trial will be conducted, the CTR provides that one application be submitted centrally, via CTIS, which will then be reviewed by designated NCAs. If successful, the resulting decision arising from the evaluation process would cover all EU Member States concerned by the application. The CTR foresees a transition period: until January 30, 2023, sponsors can choose whether to submit an initial clinical trial authorisation application in line with the CTD or via CTIS; and from January 31, 2023, the submission of initial CTA applications for a new clinical trial via CTIS will become mandatory. By January 31, 2025, all ongoing trials approved under the CTD must comply with the CTR and information relating to such clinical trials must be recorded in CTIS.
 We will no longer pursue renewal of the designation as a small and medium-sized enterprise, or SME, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, because iTeos SA, an entity based in Belgium for the purpose of the designation, exceeds the thresholds set out in the Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 (2003/361/EC). The SME designation was withdrawn in December 2022.
European Union drug marketing
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment according to the respective local enforcement regimes. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which governs medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the United Kingdom, or UK, despite its departure from the EU.
 In the EU and UK, the statutory regimes applicable to the advertising of medicinal products are supplemented by codes of practice which are developed by trade organizations. Such codes of practice are only binding on companies which are members of the relevant trade organization. However, since they represent the best practice, many non-members choose to abide by these codes of practices too. Pursuant to these codes of practice, payments made to physicians must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, their competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
European drug review and approval
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU together with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations.
 •The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products (i.e.; those which are developed using recombinant DNA technology, controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells, and hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods), orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of an acquired immune deficiency syndrome (such as HIV or AIDS), cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance for indications not covered by the mandatory centralized procedure, for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, 


when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of a MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant an MA, which is ordinarily issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of a MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding stop-clocks, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
•National MAs, which are issued by the NCAs of the EEA Member States and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EEA Member State, this national MA can be recognized in another EEA Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various EEA Member States through the decentralized procedure. 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the NCAs of the EEA Member States make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety, and efficacy.
Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Irish Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holders opted-out of the automatic conversion process. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required.
 European new active substance exclusivity
In the EEA, innovative medicinal products (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products), sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon grant of MA and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period can be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. The equivalent provisions are reflected in domestic law in the UK.
European orphan designation and exclusivity
In the EEA, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions which either affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, or where it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, there can be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition already authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by the condition).
In the EEA, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers. If orphan status is maintained at the grant of MA, the medicinal product will attract ten years of market exclusivity. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, MAs may only be granted “similar medicinal products” for the same therapeutic indication if it can be established that: (i) the new product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the MA holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the MA holder

for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
An equivalent regime is reflected in domestic law in the UK. Under the UK regime, however, orphan designations are not granted and instead a decision is made at the point of MA grant.
European pediatric investigation plan
In the EEA, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the drug for which MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO in circumstances where the medicinal product or the product class is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in part or all of the pediatric population; or the disease or condition occurs only in adult populations or the specific medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments in pediatric patients. Products that are granted an MA with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 In June 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and a transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which EU pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK, which ended on December 31, 2020. The EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable from January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of the outcomes of GMP inspections and applicants and marketing authorization holders may submit GMP certificates issued by the UK MHRA for sites located outside the EU/EEA as supporting information for EU regulatory submissions. However, the TCA does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. Great Britain has also implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain currently broadly aligns with EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes may diverge in future. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the UK in the long-term.
 European data collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA, is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective May 25, 2018. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the European Union. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to 20 million euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR grants data subjects the right to request deletion of personal

information in certain circumstances, and claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR. Maintaining compliance with the GDPR will require significant time, resources, and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.

In addition, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.
Rest of the world regulation
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
