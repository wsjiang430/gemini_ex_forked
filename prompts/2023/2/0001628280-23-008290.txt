Item 1.    Business.
Background
The Company is a Delaware corporation, formed in 2005. It operates through operating subsidiaries, including InfuSystem Holdings USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Holdings”), InfuSystem, Inc., a California corporation (“ISI”), First Biomedical, Inc., a Kansas corporation (“First Biomedical”), and IFC, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“IFC”).
Business Concept and Strategy
We are a leading national health care service provider, facilitating outpatient care for Durable Medical Equipment manufacturers and health care providers. We provide our products and services to hospitals, oncology practices, ambulatory surgery centers, and other alternate site health care providers. Our headquarters is in Rochester Hills, Michigan, and we operate our business from a total of seven locations in the United States ("U.S.") and Canada.
Our services are provided under a two-platform model. Our lead platform, Integrated Therapy Services (“ITS”), provides the last-mile solution for clinic-to-home healthcare where the continuing treatment involves complex Durable Medical Equipment and services. Our second platform, Durable Medical Equipment Services (“DME Services”), supports our ITS platform and leverages the Company's strong service orientation to win incremental business from our direct payer clients. 
We believe InfuSystem has a lot to offer the healthcare community. Over the last 30 plus years, we have developed a unique expertise and service offering that Durable Medical Equipment manufacturers and health care providers are using to reduce costs, improve service, and most importantly, provide welcome options for patients who want to continue their healthcare treatments from home. We perfected our ITS model in oncology and have proven that we can extend this model into other Durable Medical Equipment therapies. Key is the ability to leverage our existing platforms – the new therapies do not require building a new infrastructure; we simply add incrementally to the systems already in place (e.g., sales, clinical, logistics, revenue cycle management, and biomedical services).
ITS is presented as a “turnkey” solution allowing our health care provider customers to focus on the practice of medicine. InfuSystem provides the Durable Medical Equipment and treatment consumables, handles the logistics around orders and deliveries, provides 24x7 nursing support relating to the provided equipment, assumes responsibility for third-party payer Durable Medical Equipment billing, and handles biomedical services (inspection, repair, certification and replacement) for the Durable Medical Equipment. DME Services are provided as a “concierge” offering, whereby InfuSystem leverages its strong service orientation to provide incremental services to our health care provider customers on a direct payer model. DME Services include equipment rental and sales, consumable sales, and biomedical support services.
InfuSystem competes for and retains its business primarily on the basis of its long participation and strong reputation in the Durable Medical Equipment space, its long-standing relationships with Durable Medical Equipment manufacturers and its health care provider customers, and the high levels of service it provides. Current barriers to entry for potential competitors are created by our: (i) growing number of third-party payer networks under contract, which included nearly 800 third-party payer networks as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 4% over the prior year period; (ii) economies of scale, which allow for predictable reimbursement and less costly purchase and management of the pumps, respectively; (iii) established, long-standing relationships as a provider of pumps to outpatient oncology practices in the U.S. and Canada; (iv) our large pump fleet of ambulatory and large volume infusion pumps for rent and for sale, which may allow us to be more responsive to the needs of physicians, outpatient oncology practices, hospitals, outpatient surgery centers, homecare practices, patient rehabilitation centers and patients than a new market entrant; (v) seven geographic locations in the U.S. and Canada that allow for same-day or next-day delivery of pumps; (vi) our growing team of field-based and traveling biomedical technicians; and (vii) a wide array of pump repair and service capabilities. We do not perform any research and development on pumps, but we have made, and continue to make, investments in our information technology.
ITS Segment
The ITS segment’s core purpose is to seek opportunities to grow our business by leveraging our unique know-how in clinic-to-home health care involving Durable Medical Equipment, our logistics and billing capabilities, our growing network of third-party payers under contract, and our clinical and biomedical capabilities. This leverage may take the form of new products and/or services, strategic alliances, joint ventures and/or acquisitions. The leading service within our ITS segment is to supply electronic ambulatory infusion pumps and associated disposable supply kits to private oncology clinics, infusion clinics and hospital outpatient oncology clinics to be utilized in the treatment of a variety of cancers, including colorectal cancer and other 
disease states (“Oncology Business”). Colorectal cancer is the fourth most prevalent form of cancer in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society, and the standard of care for the treatment of colorectal cancer relies upon continuous chemotherapy infusions delivered via ambulatory infusion pumps. One of the goals for the ITS segment is to expand into treatment of other types of cancers. In 2022, our Oncology Business approximated 91% of our total ITS segment net revenues. In 2022, we generated approximately 47% of our total ITS segment net revenues from treatments for colorectal cancer and 44% of our ITS segment net revenues from treatments for non-colorectal disease states. There are a number of approved treatment protocols for pancreatic, head and neck, esophageal and other types of cancers, as well as other disease states which present opportunities for growth. There are also a number of other drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), as well as agents in the pharmaceutical development pipeline, which we believe could potentially be used with continuous infusion protocols for the treatment of diseases other than colorectal cancer. Additional drugs or protocols currently in clinical trials may also obtain regulatory approval over the next several years. If these new drugs or protocols obtain regulatory approval for use with continuous infusion protocols, we expect the pharmaceutical companies to focus their sales and marketing efforts on promoting the new drugs and protocols to physicians.
Furthermore, our Oncology Business focuses mainly on the continuous infusion of chemotherapy. Continuous infusion of chemotherapy can be described as the gradual administration of a drug via a small, lightweight, portable infusion pump over a prolonged period of time. A cancer patient can receive his or her medicine anywhere from one to 30 days per month depending on the chemotherapy regimen that is most appropriate to that individual’s health status and disease state. This may be followed by periods of rest and then repeated cycles with treatment goals of progression-free disease survival. This drug administration method has replaced intravenous push or bolus administration in specific circumstances. The advantages of slow continuous low doses of certain drugs are well documented. Clinical studies support the use of continuous infusion chemotherapy for decreased toxicity without loss of anti-tumor efficacy. The 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) Guidelines recommend the use of continuous infusion for treatment of numerous cancer diagnoses. We believe that the growth of continuous infusion therapy is driven by three factors: evidence of improved clinical outcomes; lower toxicity and side effects; and a favorable reimbursement environment.
The use of continuous infusion has been demonstrated to decrease or alter the toxicity of a number of cytotoxic, or cell killing, agents. Higher doses of drugs can be infused over longer periods of time, leading to improved tolerance and decreased toxicity. For example, the cardiotoxicity (heart muscle damage) of the chemotherapy drug Doxorubicin is decreased by schedules of administration according to The Chemotherapy Source Book by Michael C. Perry. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and decreased white blood cell and platelet counts are all affected by duration of delivery. Continuous infusion can lead to improved tolerance and patient comfort while enhancing the patient’s ability to remain on the chemotherapy regimen. Additionally, the lower toxicity profile and resulting reduction in side effects enables patients undergoing continuous infusion therapy to continue a relatively normal lifestyle, which may include continuing to work, going shopping, and caring for family members. We believe that the partnering of physician management and patient autonomy provide for the highest quality of care with the greatest patient satisfaction.
We believe that oncology practitioners have a heightened sensitivity to providing quality service and to their ability to obtain reimbursement for services they provide. Simultaneously, CMS and private insurers are increasingly focused on evidence-based medicine to inform their reimbursement decisions — that is, aligning reimbursement with clinical outcomes and adherence to standards of care. Continuous infusion therapy is a main component of the standard of care for certain types of cancer because clinical evidence demonstrates superior outcomes. Payers’ recognition of this benefit is reflected in their relative reimbursement policies for clinical services related to the delivery of this care.
Additional areas of focus for our ITS segment are as follows:
•Pain Management - providing our ambulatory pumps, products, and services for pain management in the area of post-surgical continuous peripheral nerve block.
•Wound Care - launched in November 2022, the Company established a partnership, SI Wound Care, LLC ("SI Wound Care"), with Sanara MedTech Inc. ("Sanara"). The partnership will focus on delivering a complete wound care solution targeted at improving patient outcomes, lowering the cost of care, and increasing patient and provider satisfaction. The partnership is expected to enable InfuSystem to offer innovative products including Cork Medical LLC’s (“Cork”) negative pressure wound therapy (“NPWT”) devices and supplies and Sanara’s advanced wound care product line to new customers through the jointly controlled entity.
•Acquisitions - we believe there are opportunities to acquire smaller, regional health care service providers, in whole or in part that perform similar services to us but do not have the national market access, network of third-party payer contracts or operating economies of scale that we currently enjoy. We may also pursue acquisition opportunities of companies that perform similar services, but offer different therapies or utilize different devices.
•Lymphedema Therapy – Lymphedema therapy includes providing patient care and customer service, pneumatic compression devices and associated garments through our partnership with Bio Compression Systems, Inc. to outpatients, initially targeting our existing acute care and oncology customers, estimated to be 20% of the multi-billion-dollar Lymphedema market.
•Information technology-based services - we also plan to continue to capitalize on key new information technology-based services such as EXPRESS, InfuBus or InfuConnect, Pump Portal, DeviceHub and BlockPain Dashboard®.
The payer environment within our ITS segment is in a constant state of change. We continue to extend our considerable breadth of payer networks under contract as patients move into different insurance coverage plans, including Medicaid and Insurance Marketplace products. In some cases, this may slightly reduce our aggregate billed revenues payment rate but result in an overall increase in collected revenues, due to a reduction in concessions. Consequently, we are increasingly focused on revenues net of concessions.
DME Services Segment
Our DME Services segment’s core service is to: (i) sell or rent new and pre-owned pole-mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps and other Durable Medical Equipment; (ii) sell treatment-related consumables; and (iii) provide biomedical recertification, maintenance and repair services for oncology practices as well as other healthcare site settings, including hospitals, home care and home infusion providers, skilled nursing and acute care facilities, pain centers and others. We purchase new and pre-owned pole-mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps from a variety of sources on a non-exclusive basis. We repair, refurbish and provide biomedical certification for the devices as needed. The pumps are then available for sale, rental or to be used within our ambulatory infusion pump management service. Our acquisition of FilAMed, a privately-held biomedical services company, on January 31, 2021 has supplemented the Company’s existing biomedical recertification, maintenance and repair services for acute care facilities and other alternate site settings including home care and home infusion providers, skilled nursing facilities, pain centers and others. Our acquisition of OB Healthcare Corporation (“OB Healthcare”), a privately-held biomedical services company, on April 18, 2021 further develops and expands InfuSystem’s DME Services segment by adding field service capabilities and complements the Company’s purchase of FilAMed.
Services
ITS Segment
Our core service within our ITS segment is our Oncology Business. After delivering our ambulatory pumps to oncology offices, infusion clinics, and hospital and outpatient chemotherapy clinics, we then directly bill and collect payment from payers and patients for the use of these pumps. At any given time, our pumps are in the possession of these facilities, on a patient, in transit, or in our facilities for cleaning, calibration and storage as reserves for increased demand.
After a physician determines that a patient is eligible for ambulatory infusion pump therapy, the physician arranges for the patient to receive an infusion pump and provides the necessary chemotherapy drugs. The physician and nursing staff train the patient in the use of the pump and initiate service. The physician bills the payers, which may include Medicare, Medicaid, third-party payer companies or patients for the physician’s professional services associated with initiating and supervising the infusion pump administration, as well as the supply of drugs. We directly bill (i) payers, (ii) facilities of our Medicare patients, and (iii) patients for the use of the pump and related disposable supplies. Billing to payers requires coordination with patients and physicians who initiate the service, as physicians’ offices must provide us with appropriate documentation (patient’s insurance information, physician’s order, an acknowledgement of benefits that shows receipt of equipment by the patient, and, in some cases, physician’s progress notes) in order for us to submit a bill to the payers. We provide assistance to uninsured patients that cannot afford our pumps via our financial hardship program – a program that usually matches what our physician practices provide as long as the uninsured patients meet certain criteria. This billing process is handled from our Rochester Hills, Michigan location.
In addition to providing high quality and convenient care, we believe that our business offers significant economic benefits for patients, providers and payers.
•Our clinical support team employs oncology, pain, Intravenous Certified, and Oncology Certified registered nurses trained on ambulatory infusion pump equipment who staff our 24x7 customer service hotline to address questions that patients may have about their pump treatment, the infusion pumps or other medical or technical questions related to the pumps.
•Physicians use our services to outsource the capital commitment, pump service, maintenance and billing and administrative burdens associated with pump ownership. Our services also allow the doctor to continue a direct relationship with the patient and to receive professional service fees for setting up the treatment and administering the drugs.
•We provide methods for the physician offices to deliver the appropriate paperwork for billing through a number of electronic means including EXPRESS and InfuConnect reducing the required effort on the employees of the physician offices.
•We believe our services are attractive to payers because such services are generally less expensive than hospitalization or standalone home health care.
Also, within ITS, we offer pain management services via electronic ambulatory infusion pumps for post-operative pain management using our pumps along with a numbing agent and a continuous nerve block catheter – continuous peripheral nerve block (“CPNB”). Using CPNB for the management of post-operative pain, which usually lasts two to three days after surgery, can result in reduced pain for the patient, increased satisfaction scores for the surgical center or hospital, and reduced need for post-operative opioid pain medication. These services include our patient care call center interaction offering support to patients and the review and collection of pain score patient outcome data for outpatient surgery centers using our proprietary BlockPain Dashboard®.
DME Services Segment
Other services we offer are classified under our DME Services segment and include the rental, sale or leasing and servicing of pole-mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps to oncology practices, hospitals and other clinical settings. These pumps are available for daily, weekly, monthly or annual rental periods. We also sell treatment consumables that can be used in conjunction with the pumps we sell and rent.
In addition to sales, rental and leasing services, we also provide biomedical maintenance, repair and certification services for the devices we offer as well as for devices owned by customers but not acquired from us. We operate pump service and repair “Centers of Excellence” from all of our locations across the U.S. and Canada and employ a staff of highly-trained technicians to provide these services. Our main Center of Excellence for service is our Lenexa, Kansas facility. In addition to the maintenance and repair services we perform at these facilities, we offer similar services that can be performed directly at our customer locations nation-wide through our team of field-based and traveling biomedical technicians. 
As of December 31, 2022, our rental fleet of pole-mounted pumps, ambulatory pumps and NPWT medical equipment for both our ITS and DME Services segments had a historical cost of $99.2 million, up from $91.9 million at the end of 2021, and included approximately 125 makes and models of equipment dedicated to our rental services. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had a fleet of new and used pole-mounted pumps, ambulatory pumps and NPWT medical equipment with a historical cost of $2.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively, for sale or rental.
Information Technology
Our Information Technology (“IT”) department is focused on not only supporting our internal IT infrastructure needs, but also supporting our revenue cycle management infrastructure including our electronic medical record technology (“EMR”) that allows medical facilities to use our infusion pumps and services via our solutions such as EXPRESS and InfuConnect. This focus has enabled current billing information to be transferred to us from participating facilities electronically and automatically. Our focus on IT solutions resulted in the development of EXPRESS, a product powered by our InfuBus data integration platform, and provides for paperless delivery of the appropriate information for InfuSystem to bill payers that:
•eliminates all paper;
•provides an enhanced visibility as a result of real time status and reporting;
•reduces risk of error;
•automates treatment logs, pump assignments, tracking and physician’s orders;
•provides a secure scanner for easy pump assignment to patients; and
•removes interruptions from physician practices’ daily schedules, and standardizes data flow for clinics and hospitals with multiple locations.
Relationships with Physician Offices
As of December 31, 2022, we had business relationships with clinical oncologists in over 2,150 outpatient oncology clinics. Although this represents a substantial number of the oncologists in the U.S., we believe that we can continue to expand 
our network to further penetrate the oncology market. Based on our retention rates and the positive results of our professional customer satisfaction research, we believe our relationships with physician offices are strong.
We believe that, in general, we do not compete directly with hospitals and physician offices to treat patients. Rather, by providing products and services to hospitals and physician offices and other care facilities and providers, we believe that we assist other providers in meeting increasing patient demand and managing institutional constraints on capital and manpower due to the nature of limited resources in hospitals and physician offices.
Physician practices in the oncology field are following the overall healthcare practices trend to consolidate. However, as of December 31, 2022, we had gained more facilities than we had lost. We expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 438 employees, including 420 full-time employees and 18 part-time or contract employees. None of our employees are unionized.
Material Suppliers
We supply a wide variety of pumps and associated equipment, as well as disposables and ancillary supplies. The majority of our pumps are electronic infusion pumps. Smiths Medical, Inc. and Moog Medical Devices Group each supplied more than 10% of the ambulatory pumps purchased by us in 2022. The Company has a supply agreement in place with each of these suppliers. Certain “spot” purchases are made on the open market subject to individual negotiation. We also supply NPWT medical equipment, as well as related disposables and ancillary supplies.
Seasonality
Revenues may be seasonal due to the impact of co-pays and deductibles for patients’ insurance that traditionally reset each January. This has been further impacted by changes in the insurance industry as it responds to increased government regulation. Also, rental customers tend to make buy versus rent decisions late in the year as customer capital budgets are being finalized, impacting sales revenue in the second half of the year, predominantly in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, as the Company’s liquidity has improved, opportunistic pump purchases are made from time to time. These opportunistic pump purchases also allow for opportunistic pump sales, which could be material. The timing of such purchases and sales vary within the course of a year.
Environmental Laws
We are required to comply with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws regulating the disposal of cleaning agents used in the process of cleaning medical equipment, as well as the disposal of sharps and blood products used in connection with the pumps and medical equipment. We do not believe that compliance with such laws has a material effect on our business.
Significant Customers
We have sought to establish contracts with as many third-party payer organizations as commercially practicable, in an effort to ensure that reimbursement is not a significant obstacle for providers who recommend continuous infusion therapy and wish to utilize our services. A third-party payer organization is a health care payer or a group of medical services payers that contracts to provide a wide variety of health care services to enrolled members through participating providers such as us. A payer is any entity that pays on behalf of a member patient.
As of December 31, 2022, we had contracts with nearly 800 third-party payer networks, an increase of 4% over the prior year period. Material terms of contracts with third-party payer organizations are typically a pre-negotiated fee schedule rate or a then-current proprietary fee schedule rate for equipment and supplies provided. The majority of these contracts generally provide for a term of one year, with automatic one-year renewals, unless we or the contracted payer elect not to renew. We also contract with various other third-party payer organizations, Medicaid, commercial Medicare replacement plans, self-insured plans, facilities of our Medicare patients and numerous other insurance carriers. No single payer or customer represented more than 10% of net revenue in 2022, 2021 or 2020.
Competitors
We believe that our competition primarily consists of national, regional, and hospital-owned Durable Medical Equipment providers and service companies, physician providers and home care infusion providers and the competitive products and services they offer. An estimate of the number of competitors is not known or reasonably available, due to the wide variety in type and size of the market participants described below. We are not aware of any industry reports with respect to the competitive market described below. The description of market segments and business activities within those market segments is based on our experiences in the industry.
•National Durable Medical Equipment Providers and Service Companies: Other national providers and service companies have offerings similar to us. These products and service offerings include, but are not limited to, third-party reimbursement, direct rental and sale of infusion electronic and disposal pumps and related products and services for patients in the home, oncology clinics, ambulatory surgery centers, hospitals and other sites of care.
•Regional Durable Medical Equipment Providers: Regional Durable Medical Equipment providers act as distributors for a variety of medical products. We believe regional Durable Medical Equipment provider sales forces generally consist of a relatively small number of salespeople, usually covering several states. Regional Durable Medical Equipment providers tend to carry a limited selection of infusion pumps and their salespeople generally have limited resources. Regional Durable Medical Equipment providers usually do not have 24x7 nursing services. We believe that Regional Durable Medical Equipment providers have relatively few third-party payer contracts, which may prevent these providers from being paid at acceptable levels and may also result in higher out-of-pocket costs for patients.
•Hospital-Owned Durable Medical Equipment Providers: Many hospitals have in-house Durable Medical Equipment providers to supply basic equipment. In general, however, these providers have limited capital and tend to stock a small inventory of infusion pumps. We believe that hospital-owned providers have limited ability to grow because of limited patient populations. Growth from outside of the hospital may pose a challenge because hospitals typically will not provide referrals to competitors, instead preferring to offer patients a choice of non-hospital-affiliated Durable Medical Equipment providers.
•Physician Providers: A limited number of physicians maintain an inventory of their own infusion pumps and provide them to patients for a fee. However, we believe that pump utilization in this area tends to be low and the costs associated with ongoing supplies, preventative maintenance and repairs can be relatively high. Moreover, we believe that a high percentage of Durable Medical Equipment claims by doctors are rejected by payers upon first submission, requiring a physician’s staff to spend significant time and effort to resubmit claims and receive payment for treatment. The numerous service and technical questions from patients may present another significant cost to a physician provider’s staff.
•Home Care Infusion Providers: Home care infusion providers provide chemotherapy drugs and services to allow for in-home patient treatment. We believe that home care infusion treatment can be very costly and that many patients do not carry insurance coverage that pay for home-based infusion services, resulting in larger out-of-pocket costs. Because home care treatments may take as long as six months, these costs can be high and can result in higher patient co-payments. We believe that home care providers may also be reluctant to offer 24x7 coverage or additional patient visits, due to capped fees.
Regulation of Our Business
Our business is subject to various regulations. Specifically, as a registered Medicare supplier of Durable Medical Equipment and related supplies, we must comply with supplier standards established by CMS regulating Medicare suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (“DMEPOS Supplier Standards”). The DMEPOS Supplier Standards consist of 30 requirements that must be met in order for a DMEPOS supplier to be eligible to receive payment for a Medicare-covered item. Some of the more significant DMEPOS Supplier Standards require us to (i) advise Medicare beneficiaries of their option to purchase certain equipment, (ii) honor all warranties under state law and not charge Medicare beneficiaries for the repair or replacement of equipment or for services covered under warranty, (iii) permit CMS agents to conduct on-site inspections to ascertain compliance with the DMEPOS Supplier Standards, (iv) maintain liability insurance in prescribed amounts, (v) refrain from contacting Medicare beneficiaries by telephone, except in certain limited circumstances, (vi) answer questions and respond to complaints of beneficiaries regarding the supplied equipment, (vii) disclose the DMEPOS Supplier Standards to each Medicare beneficiary to whom we supply equipment, (viii) maintain a complaint resolution procedure and record certain information regarding each complaint, (ix) maintain accreditation from a CMS approved accreditation organization, and (x) meet certain specified surety bond requirements.
We are also subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), which are designed to protect the security and confidentiality of certain protected health information. Under HIPAA, we must provide patients access to certain records and must notify patients of our use of protected health information and patient privacy rights. Moreover, HIPAA sets limits on how we may use individually identifiable health information and prohibits the use of patient information for marketing purposes. The adoption of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) includes a new breach notification requirement that applies to breaches of unsecured health information occurring on or after September 23, 2009. We are subject to regulations in the various states in which we operate. We believe we are in material compliance with all such regulations.
