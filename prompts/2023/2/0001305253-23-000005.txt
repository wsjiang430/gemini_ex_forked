ITEM 1. Business
Overview
We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative therapies for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and other serious diseases. All five of our rare disease programs have FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation.
Our HDV platform includes two first-in-class therapies in Phase 3 clinical trials that target critical host processes involved in viral replication. Lonafarnib is a first-in-class, oral farnesylation inhibitor and peginterferon lambda is a first-in-class, type III interferon.
D-LIVR is the pivotal Phase 3 study of lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir, alone or in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a, for HDV. The study completed enrollment of 407 patients, and we announced topline Week 48 data in December 2022, with Week 72 data expected in mid-2023. LIMT-2 is the pivotal Phase 3 study of peginterferon lambda for HDV that is currently enrolling and dosing patients with a planned enrollment of 150 patients.
We are also developing avexitide, a first in class, well-characterized GLP-1 antagonist, as a targeted treatment for two metabolic diseases with high unmet medical needs and no approved therapies: congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) and post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH). Avexitide has completed Phase 2 for both indications, and we initiated Phase 3 study startup activities for HI in 2022. 
The FDA approved our first commercial product, Zokinvy (lonafarnib), to reduce risk of mortality of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and for treatment of processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies (PL) with either heterozygous LMNA mutation with progerin-like protein accumulation, or homozygous or compound heterozygous ZMPSTE24 mutations, on November 20, 2020. Collectively known as progeria, these are ultra-rare and rapidly fatal genetic conditions of accelerated aging in children. In July 2022, we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted Eiger a centralized marketing authorization (MA). The EC's centralized MA is valid in all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. In August 2022, the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted approval in the UK. We have obtained a reimbursed price in Germany and have applied for a named patient program approvals in Spain and the UK.
We commercially launched Zokinvy in the U.S. in January 2021 and started to record product revenue in the first quarter of 2021. Our first European sales were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022.
We have historically incurred operating losses in each year since inception and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We had a net loss of $96.8 million, $33.9 million and $65.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $437.2 million. Substantially all of our operating losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations.
We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we initiate and continue the clinical development of, seek regulatory approval for, and potentially commercialize our product candidates, which will require the addition of new personnel and upgrades to our information technology systems. We expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve additional regulatory approvals. We have initiated a formal program prioritization assessment with a focus on enhancing long-term shareholder value while fulfilling the promise of advancing our high-potential product candidates for patients with serious diseases.
Clinical Product Candidates
1.Lonafarnib (LNF) for HDV
LNF is a well-characterized, orally bioavailable, first-in-class farnesylation inhibitor in a Phase 3 clinical trial for HDV infection and is our lead program. HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis for which there is currently no FDA-approved therapy. Chronic HDV infection can lead to a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, a greater likelihood of developing liver cancer, and has the highest fatality rate of all the chronic hepatitis infections.
We licensed LNF from Merck in 2010. LNF is a small molecule that blocks the production of HDV virus particles by inhibiting a key step, called farnesylation, in the virus life cycle. We have completed five Phase 2 dose-finding studies in 129 HDV-infected patients. LNF has demonstrated dose-dependent activity in reducing HDV viral load both as a monotherapy and in combination with ritonavir (RTV) and/or PEG IFN-alfa-2a. Phase 2 studies have identified two lonafarnib-based regimens, which are in our Phase 3 registration program. Both regimens have achieved clinically meaningful composite endpoints of HDV RNA decline ≥ 2 logs from baseline and normalized alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a key liver enzyme, at Week 24: all-oral regimen of LNF 50 mg boosted with RTV twice daily and combination regimen of LNF boosted with RTV combined with PEG IFN-alfa-2a. Predominantly grade 1 gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events (AE) were observed in Phase 2 amongst per-protocol treated patients. 
Our Phase 3 registration program consists of a single, pivotal, international trial, called D-LIVR, that is designed to support U.S. and EU regulatory approvals. D-LIVR has the potential to generate data for two distinct lonafarnib-based ritonavir-boosted regimens for approval. The study includes an all-oral arm of lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir and a combination arm of lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir combined with peginterferon-alfa-2a. Each arm is compared to placebo. Topline Week 48 data announced in December 2022 demonstrated that both lonafarnib-based regimens showed statistical significance versus placebo on the primary endpoint. Week 72 data is expected in mid-2023 
LNF for treatment of HDV infection has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and EMA, Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations by the FDA and PRIME designation by the EMA.
2.Peginterferon Lambda (lambda) for HDV
Lambda is our second program in clinical development for HDV and is currently in Phase 3. Lambda is a well-characterized, first-in-class, type III, well-tolerated interferon (IFN), that stimulates immune responses that are critical for the development of host protection during viral infections. 
We licensed worldwide rights to lambda from Bristol Myers Squibb in April 2016. Lambda has been administered in clinical trials involving over 4,000 patients infected with the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Hepatitis D Virus (HDV), and SARS-CoV-2. Lambda has not been approved for any indication. 
We previously completed the Phase 2 LIMT-1 study of 33 HDV-infected patients. Based on the data from LIMT-1, we have agreement with the FDA and EMA on a single pivotal, randomized Phase 3 open-label study, called LIMT-2, of lambda as a monotherapy for treatment of HDV. The primary endpoint, as achieved in Phase 2, is a durable virologic response (DVR), defined as HDV RNA below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) at 24-weeks post-treatment. LIMT-2 is currently enrolling and dosing patients across approximately fifty clinical trial sites in thirteen countries with a target enrollment of 150 patients in by mid-2023. 
Lambda for the treatment of HDV infection has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA and the EMA and Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA.
3.Combination Therapy for HDV
We have also generated data with the combination of LNF + RTV and lambda for the treatment of HDV. The Phase 2 LIFT-1 study was a single arm investigator sponsored study of lambda combined with LNF boosted with RTV for 24 weeks treatment with 24 weeks follow-up. Primary endpoint was > 2 log decline in HDV RNA at end of treatment. In November 2020, we reported positive end-of-study data from a Phase 2 single arm study called LIFT-1, conducted at the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) in 26 HDV-infected patients. 
The Phase 2 LIFT-2 single arm study of 48 weeks treatment with lambda combined with LNF boosted with RTV is planned to initiate in 2023 with an enrollment target of 30 HDV-infected patients. The primary endpoint is a DVR.
4.Peginterferon Lambda (lambda) for COVID-19
We have also generated data with lambda in multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 investigator sponsored studies of mild and moderate COVID-19 patients. 
The TOGETHER study was an investigator sponsored Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled adaptive platform study evaluating therapeutics in newly diagnosed, high-risk, non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 across twelve clinical trial sites in Brazil and 5 sites in Canada. 
The primary endpoint compared the number of emergency setting visits, hospitalizations, and/or deaths in treated patients versus placebo through Day 28. TOGETHER completed enrollment of over 1,900 predominantly vaccinated patients at high risk for developing complications from progression of COVID-19 randomized 1:1 lambda vs. placebo. Following our press release on September 6, 2022, in which we updated on the status of our planned EUA based on recent communications with the FDA, we submitted a pre-EUA meeting request to the FDA as well as additional morbidity and mortality outcomes data and analyses from the investigator-sponsored TOGETHER study. This included further statistical modeling and efficacy analyses of the study's primary and secondary endpoints and long-term follow-up data that we believe continues to support the topline outcomes reported in March. In response, the FDA denied the request for a pre-EUA meeting. Citing its concerns with the conduct of the TOGETHER study, the FDA concluded that any authorization request based on these data is unlikely to meet the statutory criteria for issuance of an EUA in the current context of the pandemic. 
The FDA suggested that, given lambda's mechanism of action and the ongoing need for improved COVID-19 therapeutics, we should consider requesting an end-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss a company-sponsored pivotal trial that could support an eventual Biologics License Application (BLA). We continue to explore opportunities for ex-US emergency use of lambda for COVID-19 and other respiratory viral infections.
5.Avexitide in Congenital Hyperinsulinism (HI)
Avexitide is a well-characterized peptide that we are developing as a treatment for congenital hyperinsulinism (HI), an ultra-rare, pediatric metabolic disorder. HI is the most frequent cause of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates and children and is characterized by fasting and protein-induced hypoglycemia and results in permanent brain damage with neurodevelopmental deficits in up to 50% of patients. Near-total pancreatectomy is often indicated and leads to life-long insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM). Safe and effective therapies are urgently needed to prevent brain damage, IDDM and death.
Avexitide binds to the GLP-1 receptor on pancreatic beta-cells and behaves as a GLP-1 antagonist and inverse agonist, reducing fasting and amino-acid induced cAMP accumulation and thereby decreasing calcium-stimulated insulin secretion. Avexitide has demonstrated clinical proof of concept and has been dosed in over 25 patients with HI at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). 
Avexitide has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of HI, Orphan Drug designation by the EMA for the treatment of HI and Orphan Drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, which includes HI. Avexitide has also been granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA.
6.Avexitide in Post-Bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH)
We are also developing avexitide as a treatment for post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH), a debilitating and potentially life-threatening condition for which there is currently no approved therapy. This disorder occurs often in a subset of bariatric surgeries including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG). PBH patients experience frequent symptomatic hypoglycemia, with blood glucose concentrations often low enough to cause seizures, altered mental status, loss of consciousness and even death. Bariatric procedures are widely performed and are increasing in frequency for medically complicated obesity.
Five clinical studies have been completed demonstrating clinical proof of concept in over 70 patients suffering from PBH indicating that avexitide can reduce hypoglycemia and associated symptoms in affected patients. Avexitide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor antagonist that competes with endogenous GLP-1 and has been shown to reduce the excessive post-prandial insulin release that characterizes this disorder. These Phase 2 data were generated using intravenous or subcutaneous (SC) formulation delivery. Pharmacokinetics from these Phase 2 SC studies indicate that the SC formulation could enable once or twice a day dosing. We developed a proprietary SC liquid formulation and completed a Phase 1 dose-ranging pharmacokinetics trial in healthy humans. In October 2018, we reported positive topline data from PREVENT, a multi-center, placebo-controlled study investigating the safety and durability of effect of 28-day dosing of SC avexitide in post-bariatric surgical patients. The primary efficacy endpoint of improved postprandial glucose nadir during mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT) was achieved with statistical significance with fewer participants requiring glycemic rescue during each of the active dosing regimens than during placebo dosing. The secondary endpoint of reduced postprandial insulin peak during MMTT was also statistically significant.
Avexitide for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and for the treatment of non-insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS) by the EMA. NIPHS describes a spectrum of acquired metabolic disorders characterized by inappropriately high insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia) and low blood glucose levels (hypoglycemia), which includes PBH. Avexitide for the treatment of PBH has also been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. Following End of Phase 2 and Scientific Advice meetings with regulatory agencies, we have agreement on a single pivotal Phase 3 study. 
Approved Product
1.Zokinvy (lonafarnib) for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and Processing-Deficient Progeroid Laminopathies (PL)
In November 2020, we received FDA approval for Zokinvy to reduce the risk of mortality in HGPS and to treat processing-deficient PL. Collectively known as progeria, these are ultra-rare and rapidly fatal genetic conditions of accelerated aging in children. Zokinvy is our first approved product, and the first approved therapy for these indications. There are approximately 20 identified patients in the U.S. who are eligible for treatment with Zokinvy. 
On July 20, 2022, we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted Eiger a centralized marketing authorization (MA) under the exceptional circumstances procedure for Zokinvy for the treatment of HGPS and PL, ultra-rare and rapidly fatal genetic conditions of accelerated aging in children. In July 2022, we announced that the European Commission (EC) granted Eiger a centralized marketing authorization (MA). The EC's centralized MA is valid in all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. In August 2022, the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted approval in the UK.
Zokinvy is a disease-modifying agent that has demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit in children and young adults with HGPS. In patients with HGPS, Zokinvy reduced the incidence of mortality by 60% (p=0.0064) and increased average survival time by at least 2.5 years. The most commonly reported adverse reactions were gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea, nausea), and most were mild or moderate (Grade 1 or 2) in severity. Many patients with HGPS have received continuous Zokinvy therapy for more than 10 years.
HGPS is an ultra-rare and rapidly fatal genetic condition of accelerated aging in children. HGPS is caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene, encoding the lamin A protein, yielding the farnesylated aberrant protein called progerin. Lamin A protein is part of the structural scaffolding that holds the nucleus together. Researchers now believe that progerin may make the nucleus unstable, and that cellular instability may lead to the process of premature aging in HGPS. Children with HGPS die of the same heart disease that affects millions of normally aging adults, arteriosclerosis, but at an average age of 14.5 years if untreated. Disease manifestations include severe failure to thrive, scleroderma-like skin, global 
lipodystrophy, alopecia, joint contractures, skeletal dysplasia, global accelerated atherosclerosis with cardiovascular decline, and debilitating strokes. 
Processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies are genetic conditions of accelerated aging caused by a constellation of mutations in the LMNA and/or ZMPSTE24 genes yielding farnesylated proteins that are distinct from progerin. While non-progerin producing, these genetic mutations result in disease manifestations with phenotypes that have overlap with, but are distinct from, HGPS. Collectively, worldwide prevalence of progeroid laminopathies is believed to be approximately 200 patients.
In November 2020, we entered into an amendment to our license agreement with Merck to include not only all uses of LNF related to the treatment of HGPS, but also progeroid laminopathies.
Business Model and Management Team
We believe that our approach to clinical development enables achievement of early clinical signals of efficacy and safety in our Phase 2 programs and potentially reduces clinical risks and costs inherent in the product discovery and development process. We have a highly experienced management team whose members have, in the course of their prior employment, participated in bringing numerous product candidates through regulatory approval and into commercialization. We plan to leverage our management team’s breadth and depth of experience in clinical and regulatory product development as well as market development and commercialization to identify potentially promising product candidates to address unmet medical needs.
Our current product candidate pipeline has been obtained by in-licensing from pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. With our focus on HDV and other serious diseases, our strategy is to acquire and retain some or all commercialization rights to our products in significant territories to diversify risk, identify a rapid regulatory pathway to approval and minimize the development investment in order to maximize long-term value for our stockholders. Over time, depending upon the data and potential market opportunity, we expect to develop an integrated commercial organization, which we believe can be targeted and cost effective for selected, promising orphan disease designated programs. We plan to balance these interests with opportunities to out-license assets from our portfolio enhance stockholder value through partnerships and other strategic relationships.
In the future, we plan to evaluate in-licensing opportunities in order to enhance our pipeline and leverage our business development, clinical development, regulatory and commercial expertise. We believe our executive management team has the capability and experience to continue to execute this model. Our executive management team has worked in other private and public biotechnology companies such as Alza Corporation, Chiron Corporation, Questcor, Valeant, and Schering-Plough, each of which was acquired by a larger biopharmaceutical industry company. Our executive management team also has previous work experience at biopharmaceutical companies, including Achillion, GlobeImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Rigel, Cytokinetics, BioMarin, Gilead, AbbVie, and Amgen.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to identify, develop, and, directly or through collaborations, bring to market novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases or conditions. We currently have a diverse portfolio of well-characterized product candidates with the potential to address life-threatening diseases for which the unmet medical need is high and, primarily focused on the development of therapies to treat and cure HDV infection. We believe we are well-positioned to be a leader in HDV and in the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for other serious diseases. Our focus to achieve this goal will be to utilize our experience and capabilities to:
•Advance our existing product candidates through late-stage clinical trials, generating meaningful clinical results;
•Work with U.S. and international regulatory authorities for expeditious, efficient development pathways toward registration;
•Prepare for commercialization of each program;
•Use our industry relationships and experience to source, evaluate and in-license well-characterized product candidates to continue pipeline development; and
•Identify potential commercial or distribution partners for our products in relevant territories.
Hepatitis Delta Virus Overview
About Hepatitis Delta Virus
HDV is a small circular ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that expresses only one protein, the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg). There are two forms of HDAg – small and large. These two forms of HDAg and the single-stranded RNA genome are surrounded by a lipid envelope, which is embedded with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) proteins. HDV does not encode its own envelope proteins and must acquire them from HBV during the final steps of replication. Hence, natural HDV infections always occur in the presence of a co-existing HBV infection. HBsAg is the only element of HBV relied upon by HDV. HDV replication can occur independently of HBV replication.
HDV is the most severe form of viral hepatitis. HDV can be acquired either by co-infection (a simultaneous co-infection with HDV and HBV) or by super-infection (HDV infection of someone already harboring a chronic HBV infection). Both co-infection and super-infection with HDV result in more severe complications compared to infection with HBV alone. These complications include a greater likelihood of experiencing liver failure in acute infections and a rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, with an increased chance of developing liver cancer in chronic infections. HDV has the highest fatality rate of all the hepatitis infections at up to 20%. Although HDV/HBV simultaneous co-infection in adults usually resolves completely, in some cases it can become fulminant hepatitis, which carries a very high mortality rate. In the case of super-infections, the predominant form of HDV, HDV super-infection leads to a more severe form of disease than chronic HBV mono-infection. In a study published in 1987 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, histological liver deterioration was observed in 77% of HBV patients co-infected with HDV over a 15-year follow-up period, versus 30% of patients infected with HBV alone (p<0.01). In a 2013 study of chronic HBV patients published in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, cirrhosis was present in 73% of HBV patients co-infected with HDV, compared to only 22% of those infected with HBV alone. Patients co-infected with HDV are more than twice-as-likely to develop liver-related complications, cirrhosis, or require liver transplants than matched patients infected with HBV alone.
HDV is generally spread through exchange of body fluids either sexually or through contact with infected blood. Globally, it is estimated that between 4.3% and 5.7% of the 240 million worldwide chronic HBV population, or 10 to 14 million people, are infected with HDV. The prevalence of HDV in patients infected with chronic HBV is even higher in certain 
regions, including certain parts of Mongolia, China, Russia, Central Asia, Pakistan, Turkey, Africa and South America, with an HDV prevalence as high as 60% being reported in HBV-infected patients in Mongolia and Pakistan. The prevalence of HDV has recently begun to increase in Western Europe and the United States due to migration from countries with high infection rates.
The Role of HDV Screening in Identifying Patients Who May Benefit from LNF and/or Lambda
Active HDV infections are best detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for genomic RNA. These assays yield a quantitative assessment of the number of viral particles, or viral load, in serum. A commercial assay for quantitative HDV RNA has been available in Europe (Robogene®) since 2015. Quest Diagnostics and ARUP Laboratories offer commercial assays for quantitative HDV RNA testing in the United States. Both assays are calibrated using the World Health Organization HDV standard provided by the Paul Erhlich Institute in Germany.
Our initial discussions with payors have indicated that they would be willing to reimburse healthcare providers for HDV RNA quantitative assays that are carried out following a positive HBsAg test for HBV. Greater availability of commercial assays will increase the number of assays performed and increase the number of identified patients who can potentially benefit from an HDV therapies such as LNF and lambda.
Current Therapy for HDV
Currently, there is no FDA-approved therapy for hepatitis delta virus infection. Hepcludex (buleviritide) was conditionally approved in Europe in 2020 for treatment of chronic HDV, and a BLA was submitted to the U.S. FDA in November 2021. In October 2022, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) citing concerns regarding the manufacture and delivery of bulevirtide.
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines suggest treatment of chronic hepatitis delta infections with IFN-alfa. In clinical trials of IFN-alfa or PEG IFN-alfa, between 25% and 33% of HDV infected patients were able to achieve undetectable HDV RNA after a minimum of 48 weeks of therapy, with some requiring two years of therapy. However, long-term therapy with IFN-alfa is known to be associated with numerous adverse events and tolerability is a significant problem for some of these patients. In addition, rebound of HDV RNA occurs in greater than 50% of patients. 
HBV nucleoside analogs that suppress HBV DNA are ineffective against HDV since they are ineffective in suppressing the expression HBsAg. Current development programs targeting HBV functional cures are in early stages and are not expected to eliminate extra-hepatic reservoirs of HBsAg. Given that HDV only requires small amounts of HBsAg for virion assembly, functional cures, if achieved, will not eradicate HDV. 
HDV Replication and Farnesylation
After HDV enters a target cell hepatocyte, the genome is translocated to the nucleus where genome replication occurs and the two forms of HDAg small delta antigen (SHDAg) and large delta antigen (LHDAg) are produced. The newly formed 
HDV genome and the small and large delta antigen must acquire a lipid envelope from HBV to complete the assembly process. An important interaction between HDV and HBV proteins has been shown to depend on the presence of the last four amino acids of the large delta antigen, comprising a CXXX box motif, where C represents cysteine and X denotes any other amino acid. This amino acid sequence is required for LHDAg to be farnesylated by a host enzyme which covalently attaches a 15-carbon prenyl lipid (farnesyl-moiety) to the cysteine of the CXXX box. Farnesylation of the large delta antigen renders it more lipophilic, promotes its association with HBsAg and is essential for initiating the HDV particle formation process. Our approach involves targeting this host process called farnesylation, or protein farnesylation, which has been shown to be essential for the last steps in HDV replication, the assembly and release of new virus progeny.
In the 1980s, farnesyltransferase inhibitors were developed by multiple pharmaceutical companies for oncology indications. Addition of a farnesyl or prenyl lipid group to the Ras protein (Ras) a well-known and important regulator of cellular proliferation, allows for membrane association. Once membrane bound, Ras may then be activated. The importance of activated Ras in tumor development was demonstrated by sequence analyses of tumors from patients where up to 30% have mutations involving Ras. Several farnesylation inhibitors were developed in oncology and taken into the clinic and in some cases through late-stage clinical development. However, these programs did not lead to approvals, due to a lack of compelling efficacy. The class-related, dose-limiting toxicity has been gastrointestinal side effects including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and weight loss.
Published studies demonstrate that farnesyltransferase inhibitors block HDV viral production both in cellular experiments and in HDV transgenic mice. Targeting farnesylation or farnesyltransferase, a host target, significantly reduces the likelihood of HDV developing resistance to escape effects of antiviral therapy. Viruses mutate quickly and there is a higher rate of mutations in viral replication compared to mammalian cell division. However, no matter how much HDV may mutate, these changes are unlikely to alter the host process of farnesylation which HDV requires to complete packaging. Thus, targeting a host farnesylation process provides what we believe to be a higher barrier to resistance. Identification of clinic-ready farnesylation inhibitors has allowed us to move rapidly into proof-of-concept studies in humans.
Our First HDV Opportunity: Lonafarnib (LNF) for HDV
Lonafarnib (LNF) is a well-characterized, orally active inhibitor of farnesyltransferase. LNF inhibits the farnesylation step of HDV replication inside liver cells and blocks the ability of the virus to multiply. Since farnesylation is a host process, not under control of HDV, and LNF inhibits farnesylation, we believe that there is also a potentially higher barrier to resistance with LNF therapy. LNF for the treatment of HDV infection has been granted Orphan Drug designation in Europe and the United States, and LNF in combination with RTV has been granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations from the FDA for the treatment of chronic HDV infections.
In the United States, we have issued patents, U.S. Patent No. 10,076,512; 10,828,283; and 11,311,519, all entitled Treatment of Hepatitis Delta Virus Infection. The issued claims cover a broad range of RTV-boosted LNF doses and durations with and without interferons. The European Patent Office, the Chinese Patent Office and the Japan Patent Office have also granted patents with claims covering a broad range of LNF boosted with RTV dosing regimens for the treatment of chronic HDV infection. 
LNF Phase 2 Clinical Data
We licensed LNF from Merck in 2010, and have relied upon Merck’s prior Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical experience with LNF in over 2,000 patients to understand safety and pharmacokinetics.
We have completed five Phase 2 trials (POC, LOWR-1, LOWR-2, LOWR-3, LOWR-4) with LNF in 129 HDV-infected patients. The Phase 2 LOWR HDV (Lonafarnib With Ritonavir in HDV) Program identified dose(s) and regimen(s) for registration.
•POC Study (Placebo-controlled LNF monotherapy) (N=14)
•LOWR-1 Study (Combination: LNF with RTV or PEG IFN-alfa-2a) (N=21)
•LOWR-2 Study (Dose Finding: LNF + RTV ± PEG IFN-alfa-2a) (N=58)
•LOWR-3 Study (QD Dosing: LNF + RTV) (N=21)
•LOWR-4 Study (Dose-Escalation: LNF + RTV) (N=15)
The Phase 2 NIH proof-of-concept study demonstrated statistically significant decreases in HDV RNA viral load with two LNF active groups versus placebo for 28-days. A statistically significant correlation between increasing LNF serum levels and decreasing HDV RNA viral loads was also observed, demonstrating that higher serum levels resulted in greater decline in HDV RNA.
The Phase 2 LOWR studies demonstrated benefits of twice daily RTV-boosting of LNF for up to 24 weeks of dosing. RTV is a pharmacokinetic (PK) enhancer known to inhibit the metabolism of LNF, allowing lower doses of LNF to be administered, while resulting in higher systemic concentrations of LNF. The Phase 2 LOWR HDV studies identified two LNF-based regimens that can achieve clinically meaningful composite endpoints of HDV RNA decline ≥ 2 logs from baseline and normalized ALT at Week 24: all-oral regimen of LNF 50 mg BID boosted with RTV twice daily and combination regimen of LNF 50 or 25 mg BID boosted with RTV combined with PEG IFN-alfa-2a (see figures below). These dosing regimens were associated with predominantly grade 1 GI AEs amongst per-protocol treated patient.
Phase 3 D-LIVR Study
D-LIVR (Delta-Liver Improvement and Virologic Response in HDV) is an international, multi-center, Phase 3 study of LNF-treated patients (total N=407 patients including controls) to evaluate an all-oral arm of LNF boosted with RTV and a combination arm of LNF boosted with RTV and peginterferon-alfa-2a (PEG IFN-alfa-2a), with each arm compared to a placebo arm (background HBV nucleos(t)ide only), in HDV-infected patients. A PEG IFN-alfa-2a alone arm is included to demonstrate contribution of effect only. The LNF containing arms are not required to demonstrate superiority over PEG IFN-alfa-2a alone. The primary endpoint is a composite of a ≥ 2 log decline in HDV RNA and ALT normalization at end of 48 weeks of treatment with LNF-based regimens versus placebo.
D-LIVR is an international study, with over 100 sites across over twenty countries. Week 48 topline data was reported on December 8, 2022, with Week 72 data expected by mid-2023.
Topline Week 48 results showed that both treatment arms achieved statistical significance over placebo in the composite primary endpoint as well as the component virologic and biochemical responses. Study participants receiving the all-oral therapy and combination therapy showed a composite response of 10.1% (p=0.0044) and 19.2% (p <0.0001), respectively, compared to those receiving placebo (1.9%). A peginterferon alfa comparator arm was included in the study to show contribution of effect. The composite response rate in the all-oral arm was comparable to the peginterferon alfa arm (10.1% vs 9.6%). The composite response rate in the combination arm was twice that of the peginterferon alfa arm (19.2% vs 9.6%).
Breaking the composite primary endpoint into its two component parts also showed statistically significant improvements for both parameters. Looking first at virologic response, defined as a greater than or equal to 2 log reduction of HDV RNA, 14.6% of the study participants receiving the all-oral therapy showed improvement with a p-value of 0.0026, and 32.0% of the patients receiving combination therapy showed improvement with a p-value less than 0.0001, compared to 3.8% of those patients receiving placebo. For ALT normalization, 24.7% of the study participants receiving the all-oral therapy 
showed improvement with a p-value of 0.003, and 34.4% of those patients receiving the combination therapy showed improvement with a p-value less than 0.0001, compared to 7.7% of those patients receiving placebo.
The key secondary histological endpoint was defined as ≥2-point improvement in histological activity index (HAI) and no worsening of Ishak fibrosis scoring as determined by blinded assessment of paired liver biopsies (n=229) collected at baseline and Week 48. This was demonstrated in 35 of 66 patients (53%, p=0.0139) with statistical significance in the combination arm versus 8 of 30 patients (27%) receiving placebo. Response was demonstrated in 35 of 107 patients (33%, p=0.61) in the all-oral arm versus placebo. Response in the peginterferon alfa comparator arm was 10 of 26 patients (38%).
Remaining secondary endpoints including virologic, biochemical, and composite responses at Week 72 (24-weeks post-treatment), are being collected and are expected to be reported mid-2023. 
Our Second HDV Program: Peginterferon Lambda (lambda) for HDV
Lambda is a well-characterized, late-stage, first in class, type III, well-tolerated interferon (IFN) that we in-licensed from Bristol-Myers Squibb in April 2016. Lambda is being developed as a well-tolerated interferon. Lambda stimulates immune responses that are critical for the development of host protection during viral infections. Lambda targets type III IFN receptors which are distinct from the type I IFN receptors targeted by IFN-alfa. These type III receptors are highly expressed on hepatocytes with limited expression on hematopoietic and central nervous system cells, which has been demonstrated to reduce the off-target effects associated with other IFNs and improve the tolerability of lambda (Chan 2016). Although lambda does not use the IFN-alfa receptor, signaling through either the IFN-lambda or IFN-alfa receptor complexes results in the activation of the same Jak-STAT signal transduction cascade. 
In clinical trials of IFN-alfa or PEG IFN-alfa-2a, after 48-72 weeks of therapy, between 25% and 33% of HDV-infected patients were HDV RNA undetectable 24 weeks after stopping therapy. However, IFN-alfa is known to be associated with numerous adverse events and tolerability is a significant problem for many of these patients. We are developing lambda as a well-tolerated interferon, either as a monotherapy and in a combination with LNF + RTV.
Lambda Clinical Data
LIMT-1 Monotherapy Phase 2 Clinical Trial
LIMT-1 was a 1:1 randomized, open-label Phase 2 study of lambda 120 mcg or 180 mcg subcutaneous injections administered weekly for 48 weeks in 33 patients with chronic HDV. End of treatment was followed by a treatment-free 24-week observation period. The primary objective of the Phase 2 study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment with two dose levels of lambda in patients with chronic HDV infection. All patients were administered an anti-HBV nucleos(t)ide analog throughout the study. The trial was conducted at four international sites in New Zealand, Israel and Pakistan. 
Week 48 end-of-treatment data were presented in November 2018 at AASLD. At Week 48, patients in the 180 μg lambda treated group experienced a 2.4 log mean decline in HDV-RNA, with 6 of 10 (60%) experiencing ≥ 2 log decline, 4 of 10 (40%) patients were HDV-RNA negative at end of treatment. At Week 48, patients in the 120 μg lambda treated group experienced a 1.5 log mean decline in HDV RNA, with 6 of 14 (42.9%) experiencing ≥ 2 log decline, 2 of 14 (14.3%) patients were HDV-RNA negative at end of treatment. The most commonly reported AEs were moderate headache, pyrexia, fatigue, and myalgia. Observed ALT flares result from vigorous antiviral immunological response to treatment, not due to direct hepatotoxicity. End of 24-week follow-up data, presented in April 2019 at EASL, demonstrated that 36% of HDV infected patients were able to maintain HDV RNA below limit of quantitation (BLQ) 24-weeks post-treatment, or a Durable Virologic Response (DVR), and achieve ALT normalization. These data are illustrated below.
LIMT-1 study did not include per-protocol liver biopsies. However pre- and post-treatment liver biopsies were collected for two patients where regression in liver fibrosis from F5 to F1 and F4 to F1 was observed. This is the first demonstration of regression in liver fibrosis with a finite lambda treatment.
Phase 3 LIMT-2 Study
We have an agreement with the FDA and EMA on a single pivotal Phase 3 study, called LIMT-2, of lambda as a monotherapy for treatment of HDV.
LIMT-2 is a randomized, open-label, parallel-arm study that will include 150 patients randomized 2:1 to two different lambda-containing arms. The first arm is 48 weeks of treatment with lambda 180 mcg administered weekly and a 24-week off-treatment follow-up period. The second arm is 12-weeks of no therapy followed by 48 weeks of treatment with weekly lambda 180 mcg and a 24-weeks off-treatment follow-up period. The primary endpoint is a Durable Virologic Response (DVR), or HDV RNA below limit of quantitation (BLQ) or undetectable, 24-weeks post treatment of Arm 1 compared to placebo after 12-weeks of no treatment of Arm 2. All patients will be administered an anti-HBV nucleos(t)ide analog throughout the study. LIMT-2 is currently enrolling a target of 150 patients in across approximately 50 sites in 13 countries.
Potential for Registration in HDV for LNF/RTV and Lambda
LNF/RTV (D-LIVR) and lambda (LIMT-2) form our HDV platform strategy with multiple opportunities to win for HDV patients. While the D-LIVR study has a composite primary endpoint (> 2 log reduction in HDV RNA and ALT normalization) at Week 48, the response rate at 24 weeks post-treatment may support accelerated approval of LNF/RTV for finite therapy. Similarly, the LIMT-2 primary endpoint (DVR at 24 weeks post-treatment) for lambda is intended to support accelerated approval for finite therapy. Our first goal is approval of these treatments for HDV, where there is an urgent, unmet medical need. Key opinion leaders have suggested that combinations of LNF/RTV and lambda with other antiviral agents may demonstrate an even greater antiviral effect. 
Our Proprietary HDV Combination Therapy: Lambda and LNF + RTV
Phase 2 LIFT-1 HDV Combination Clinical Trial
LIFT-1 (Lambda Interferon combination Therapy) was an open-label, Phase 2 study evaluating lambda in combination with lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir in 26 HDV-infected patients. Patients were dosed for 24 weeks and underwent off-treatment follow-up for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was >2 log decline in HDV RNA at end of 24-weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoint was an improvement in histology (>2-point improvement in histological activity index and no progression in fibrosis) at end of follow-up. LIFT-1 was conducted within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) at the NIDDK. The final end-of-treatment and end-of-study data were reported in November 2020 at the AASLD conference and are summarized in the figure below. 
The data demonstrated that after 24 weeks of treatment, by per protocol analysis, 77% of patients (17 of 22) achieved the primary efficacy end point of >2 log decline in HDV RNA, with 50% of patients (11 of 22) either HDV RNA BLQ or undetectable. At Week 48 (24 weeks post-treatment), 5 of 22 patients (23%) maintained HDV RNA BLQ or were HDV RNA undetectable, 11 of 20 patients (55%) demonstrated improvement in Histology Activity Index (HAI), and 6 of 20 patients (30%) achieved the secondary endpoint of > 2 point improvement in HAI.
Phase 2 LIFT-2 HDV Combination Clinical Trial
LIFT-2 (Lambda Interferon combination Therapy) is an open-label, Phase 2 study that will evaluate lambda in combination with lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir in 30 HDV-infected patients. Patients will be dosed for 48 weeks with follow-up for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is a DVR, or HDV RNA below the limit of quantitation at 24 weeks post-treatment. LIFT-2 will also be conducted within the (NIH) at the NIDDK. If positive, data from LIFT-2 will provide additional support for this combination therapy.
Congenital Hyperinsulinism (HI) Overview
Congenital Hyperinsulinism (HI) is an ultra-rare pediatric metabolic disease. HI presents with severe hypoglycemia in the neonatal period requiring intensive care hospitalization, administration of high rates of intravenous glucose through central lines, continuous intravenous administration of glucagon and in most instances surgical treatment by pancreatectomy during the neonatal period or during infancy. The most common and severe form of HI is refractory to medical treatment with diazoxide and affects approximately 60% of all patients. This form of HI arises out of inactivating mutations in the genes encoding the KATP channel, resulting in focal and diffuse forms of HI. Focal disease, occurring in approximately 50% of patients with KATP HI, resolves in 97% of cases after partial pancreatectomy. Diffuse disease persists in 41% of cases after subtotal (98%) pancreatectomy. However, by the age of 14 years old, data show that 91% of patients undergoing subtotal pancreatectomy develop insulin-dependent diabetes, at which point hyperinsulinism is no longer 
present. Thus, HI is a congenital, rare pediatric disease with life-threatening manifestations of severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia occurring primarily during the neonatal period, infancy, childhood and adolescence. 
Clinical Data to Date
To date, a total of 39 patients with KATP HI enrolled in 3 clinical investigations at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) have received avexitide administered by continuous IV infusion: 10 adolescents and adults, 16 children, and 13 neonates. Data generated across all 3 clinical investigations suggest that treatment with avexitide may effectively reduce fasting and postprandial hypoglycemia in patients with HI. Avexitide treatment was well tolerated, with no serious drug-related adverse events (AEs) reported. Data from each of the three studies are presented in the figures below. Avexitide for treatment of HI has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation by the FDA.
In April 2022, Eiger announced it is initiating the Phase 3 registrational program for avexitide in congenital hyperinsulinism (HI) by the end of the year. In connection with our Phase 3, startup activities, we observed low levels of product-related impurities in the finished drug product. Although not unusual for this class of compounds, we are working with our CMO's to control and qualify these materials and plan to initiate dosing when an adequate supply of materials with a sufficient shelf life has been released. Avexitide has been granted Orphan Drug designation in the U.S. by the FDA for the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (which includes HI) and has also been granted Rare Pediatric Disease designation making it potentially eligible for a priority review voucher upon regulatory approval. Avexitide is the only investigational therapy for HI that has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. 
Post-bariatric Hypoglycemia (PBH) Overview
As the use of bariatric surgical procedures has increased worldwide due to rising obesity and Type 2 diabetes, a new post-surgical complication, hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, has been increasingly diagnosed and reported in the procedures that involve reducing the size of the stomach with a vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or by resecting and re-routing the small intestine to a small stomach pouch (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). This disorder leads to frequent symptomatic hypoglycemia, often resulting in glucose concentrations low enough to cause seizures, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, cognitive dysfunction, disability and death. Quality of life can be severely diminished, and many patients cannot care for themselves or others, work, drive, or be left alone. There is no approved treatment for this condition. Severe cases have historically been surgically managed with near-total to total pancreatectomy, which results in insulin dependent diabetes and is associated with a greater than 6% surgical mortality risk.
Research suggests that elevated GLP-1 may play an important role in mediating the glucose-lowering effect associated with bariatric surgery. Surgically altered nutrient transit, resulting from bariatric surgeries can cause early nutrient sensing by the intestinal “L” cells, leading to enhanced secretion of GLP-1 causing elevated insulin secretion. This effect may play a primary role in the early resolution of Type 2 diabetes after surgery. In patients with PBH, excessive secretion of GLP-1 and/or exaggerated sensitivity to GLP-1 results in dysfunctional insulin release, leading to severe, debilitating hypoglycemia. GLP-1 receptor antagonists compete with endogenous GLP-1 and have the potential to prevent dysfunctional insulin release and resultant symptomatic hypoglycemia.
Clinical Data to Date
Five clinical studies involving over 70 patients with PBH have demonstrated that pharmacologic blockade of the GLP-1 receptor can reduce hypoglycemia and associated symptoms. We believe that avexitide may represent the first targeted medical treatment for patients with PBH. In studies completed to date, there have been no significant adverse drug reactions attributed to avexitide.
We completed our Phase 2 study called PREVENT in October 2018. The PREVENT study was a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study to assess the efficacy and safety of 28-day dosing of avexitide in patients with PBH. A total of 18 patients were enrolled and treated with two dosing regimens (once daily and twice daily) of avexitide for 28 days. All patients participated in three 14-day treatment periods, involving placebo SC 
injections, once-daily avexitide SC injections, and twice-daily avexitide SC injections. Patients self-administered injections in the outpatient setting throughout the study duration and additionally underwent in-clinic MMTT provocations with concomitant blood draws and symptom assessments following each 14-day treatment period. Participants' metabolic and clinical outcomes were assessed in the outpatient setting by electronic diary, self -monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and postprandial glucose, insulin, and symptom responses were assessed during MMTT provocation in the in-clinic setting. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of improved postprandial glucose nadir during MMTT was achieved with statistical significance with avexitide 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD, with fewer participants requiring glycemic rescue during each of the active dosing regimens than during placebo dosing. The secondary endpoint of reduced postprandial insulin peak during MMTT was also statistically significant with avexitide 30 mg BID and 60 mg QD. The primary and secondary endpoints are shown in the figure below.
Metabolic and clinical improvements were also monitored during each patients’ daily routine in the outpatient setting and assessed by electronic diary and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Patients experienced fewer episodes of Levels 1-3 hypoglycemia during both dosing regimens of avexitide as compared to placebo as shown in the table below. 
METABOLIC AND CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS

Change from Placebo | N/A | -0.49(p=0.224) | -1.09(p=0.014) 

Rate is defined as number of episodes in a 14 day period
Level 1 Hypoglycemia is defined as hypoglycemia symptoms confirmed by SBGM concentrations of <70 mg/dL
Level 2 Hypoglycemia (Clinically Important Hypoglycemia) is defined as SMBG < 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L)
Level 3 Hypoglycemia (Severe Hypoglycemia) is defined as a severe event characterized by altered mental and/or physical functioning that requires assistance from another person for recovery. This applies regardless of whether a patient actually receives external assistance
Avexitide was well tolerated. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events and no participant withdrawals. Adverse events were typically mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events were injection site bruising, nausea, and headache, all of which occurred with lower frequency during avexitide dosing periods than during the placebo dosing period. Avexitide has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. In 2020, we received concurrence with the FDA and EMA on a single Phase 3 trial for avexitide for treatment of PBH.
Manufacturing
We currently contract with third parties for the commercial manufacturing of our FDA-approved product, Zokinvy, and all of our clinical product candidates and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical trial materials of our product candidates and have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) eliminates the need for us to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing our CMOs.
To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for the product candidates. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands but have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical material for products in clinical development. We have identified or plan to identify commercial contract manufacturers as we move our product candidates to Phase 3 clinical trials. We believe there are alternate sources of manufacturing that could be identified and enabled to satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, however, we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources can be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of our product candidates. All of our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance with applicable regulations and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our products for commercial sales.
We have qualified and finalized or are in process of finalizing commercial supply agreements with contract manufacturers of Zokinvy (lonafarnib) and have identified commercial manufacturers for lambda and plan to proceed with qualifications.
Lonafarnib
The drug product for completed lonafarnib (LNF) Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of HDV and HGPS was manufactured by Merck. We have successfully completed the technology transfer for manufacture of the LNF drug substance and the LNF drug product to our third-party manufacturers. All future HDV clinical trials will be conducted with product manufactured by these CMOs. These manufacturers produce our commercial supply for HGPS and processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies.
Lambda
We have completed the technology transfer from BMS to our CRO for our lambda program. As part of the license agreement, sufficient inventory of product was obtained to complete our Phase 2 and initiate our Phase 3 clinical trials. We have manufactured additional batches of lambda products.
Both lonafarnib and lambda are GMP products from all CMOs.
Avexitide
The drug substance and drug product used for the production of avexitide clinical trial material for the treatment of HI and PBH is manufactured by our third-party CMOs. 
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and in-license those proprietary technologies, inventions, and improvements we believe are important to our business. We seek and maintain, where available, patent protection for our product candidates including: composition dosage, formulation, use, manufacturing process, among others. We have also licensed patents and patent applications that cover certain of our product candidates and/or their manufacture, use, or formulation. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
We also rely, or plan to rely, on regulatory exclusivity, including Orphan Drug designation and New Chemical Entity (NCE) and Biologic License Application (BLA) exclusivities, as well as trade secrets and carefully monitor our proprietary information to protect all aspects of our business.
We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio by filing patent applications for our product candidates. We file and prosecute patent applications in the United States and Europe and, when appropriate, additional countries, including Japan, Korea, Canada and China.
Our success will depend significantly upon our ability to: (i) obtain and maintain patents and other exclusivity protections for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; (ii) prosecute our patent applications to issue as patents and defend and enforce our patents; (iii) maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by others; (iv) preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and (v) operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of others. In addition to maintaining our existing proprietary assets, we seek to strengthen our proprietary positions when economically reasonable to do so. Our ability to augment our proprietary position relies on its: (i) know-how; (ii) ability to access technological innovations, and (iii) ability to in-license technology when appropriate.
The patent positions of pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific, and factual issues. In addition, the scope claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced during the patent prosecution process before any patent issues. After issuance of a patent, if the issued patent is challenged, then the courts or a patent office can redefine the scope of the patent, including by invalidating some or all of the patent claims, or rendering the patent unenforceable in its entirety. Consequently, we do not know with certainty whether patents will issue in each country in which we or our licensors file patent applications, or if those patent applications, if ever issued, will 
issue with claims that cover our product candidates, or, even if they do issue, whether the patent or its relevant claims will remain enforceable upon challenge. Accordingly, we cannot predict with certainty whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in a particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from potential competitors to make any of our products commercially successful. Any of our patents, including already issued in-licensed patents or any patents that may issue to us or our licensors in the future, could be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. Newly filed patent applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO) and certain other patent offices are maintained in secrecy for a minimum of 18 months, and publications of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lag far behind the actual discoveries themselves. For these reasons, we cannot be certain that inventions claimed in pending patent applications were not invented by another party prior to our invention or disclosed or claimed in a patent application filed before the effective filing date of our applications, in either of which case the claims may not be patentable to us. For certain applications with an effective filing date prior to March 13, 2013, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention. Also, while we are not currently participating in any interferences or post-grant challenge proceedings, such as patent oppositions, post-grant reexamination proceedings, inter parties review proceedings and patent litigation, that seek to invalidate claims of pending patent applications or issued patents, we may have to participate in such proceedings in the future. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries where they are issued. In most countries, the standard patent term for inventions relating to human drugs and their formulation and use is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional patent or international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty of 1970 (PCT).
The PCT is an international patent law treaty that provides a single PCT application can be converted into a patent application in any of the more than 154 PCT contracting states, providing a cost-effective means for seeking patent protection in numerous regions or countries. Conversion of a PCT application into an application in any of the contracting states typically occurs about 30 months after a priority application is filed, or about 18 months after the PCT application filing date. An applicant must undertake prosecution within the allotted time in the patent offices of any, or a combination, of the contracting states or in a regional patent office it determines to undertake patent issuance in protection in such country or territory. 
We own or in-license a number of patents in the U.S. and foreign countries that cover our products, product candidates, and methods of their use. With respect to our owned or in-licensed issued patents in the U.S. and Europe, we may be entitled to obtain an extension of patent term to extend the patent expiration date. For example, in the U.S., this extended coverage period is known as patent term extension (PTE) and can only be obtained provided we apply for and receive a marketing authorization for a product. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent, but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. In Europe, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPC) may also be available to patents, which would be available by applying to the member states. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as getting marketing approval from the FDA.
Patent Protection of Our Product Candidates
The exclusivity positions for our clinical-stage product candidates as of December 31, 2022 are summarized below.
LNF. We have licensed from Merck a portfolio of patents and know how covering the compound, formulations of the compound, and synthesis, but these expire before the anticipated launch date of the LNF product candidate. 
In the United States, we have obtained patent protection for the use of LNF in combination with RTV for the treatment of HDV infection. Eiger’s U.S. Patent Nos. 10,076,512; 10,828,283; and 11,311,519 entitled, Treatment of Hepatitis Delta Virus Infection, include claims covering a broad range of RTV-boosted LNF doses and durations with and without interferons. The patents have terms that extend at least until 2035. Additional claims are being pursued in a continuation application. The European Patent Office, the Chinese Patent office and the Japanese Patent Office have also granted patents with claims covering a broad range of LNF boosted with RTV dosing regimens for the treatment of HDV infection. These patents will have a term that extends to 2035. In Europe, China and Japan, additional claims are being pursued in divisional applications. We have now obtained patent protection with claims covering treatment of HDV with LNF boosted with RTV the U.S., Europe, China and Japan, which are key major pharmaceutical markets. A corresponding patent application claiming the use of lonafarnib boosted with ritonavir is pending in Korea. Additionally, US Patent 10,835,496 and a 
European Patent issued claiming particular dosage forms for ritonavir-boosted lonafarnib for the treatment of HDV infections. A Notice of Allowance was also received for an application in South Korea. These patents extend protection until at least 2036.
We have in-licensed from The Progeria Research Foundation patents covering the methods of treating Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), and progeroid laminopathies. The patents provide protection until at least 2024 and an application for patent term extension (PTE) that could extend the protection for one of the patents until 2029 has been filed. We have also filed a patent application in the U.S. directed to methods of treating HGPS and progeroid laminopathies that if issued would provide further protection until at least 2039. In addition, LNF has been granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and the EMA in this indication, which respectively may provide up to seven and ten years of regulatory exclusivity.
Lambda. We have in-licensed from BMS a portfolio of patents relating to the manufacture, use, and compositions of interferon lambda modified by polyethylene glycol derivatization (lambda). The key United States composition of matter patent in this portfolio expires in 2025, but we expect to be eligible for the full five years of patent term extension for that patent. In addition, we expect regulatory approval for lambda to be filed under a BLA, which if granted would provide 12 years reference product exclusivity (4 years in filing exclusivity; 12 years for data), as well as Orphan Drug exclusivity for treatment of HDV infection. 
In the United States and Europe, we have obtained patent protection for the use of lambda for treatment of HDV infection. U.S. Patent No. 10,953,072 issued with claims covering the use of lambda to treat HDV. The term of this patent extends at least until 2037. The European Patent Office has also granted a patent with claims covering use of lambda to treat HDV. Additional claims are being pursued in continuation/divisional applications in the U.S. and Europe. Applications are also pending in China, Japan and Korea. Any patents that issue from these applications will expire in 2037. 
We also filed a PCT application relating to the use of lambda in HDV that has matured into patent applications in the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and South Africa. Any patents that issue from these applications should offer protection until at least 2039.
In addition, we have filed a PCT application related to the use of lambda and lonafarnib and ritonavir to treat HDV, that has matured into patent applications in the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, and South Africa. Any patents that issue from these applications should offer protection until at least 2040. Lastly, we also filed a PCT application related to the use of lambda to treat COVID-19 that has matured into patent applications in the United States, Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Columbia, Eurasia, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Ukraine, Vietnam, and South Africa. 
Avexitide. We have in-licensed from Stanford two PCT applications that claim the use of avexitide and other agents in the treatment of hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery, including in PBH. The USPTO issued US 10,639,354, US 10,660,937, US 10,993,992, and US 10,993,991, which provide protection at least until 2036. Up to five years of patent term extension will be available in the United States. The European Patent Office has also granted two patents with claims covering use of avexitide to treat hypoglycemia, which will expire in 2036. Two Australian patents and a Chilean patent have also issued with similar claims, which will also expire in 2036 Additional claims are being pursued in continuation/divisional applications in the U.S. and Europe. Applications are also pending in Canada, and Chile. Any patents that issue from these applications will expire in 2036. Additionally, avexitide has been granted Orphan Drug designation in the treatment of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia by the FDA and the EMA, which provides seven years and ten years of regulatory exclusivity in the United States and Europe, respectively. 
In the United States, we have obtained patent protection for formulations of avexitide and the use of these formulations in the treatment of hypoglycemia associated with bariatric surgery. The USPTO issued US 11,020,484, which will provide protection at least until 2037. Additional claims are being pursued in continuation application. Applications are also pending in Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Israel, India, and Japan. Any patents that issue from these applications will expire in 2037. 
We have also filed a PCT application related to method of treating HI and PBH, that has matured into patent applications in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Europe, Israel, and Japan. If issued, the patents will provide protection until 2039. We have also filed a PCT application related to method of treating congenital hyperinsulinism, which will offer protection until 2042 if issued into patents at the national stage.
We have in-licensed patents and patent applications from the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), relating to hyperinsulinemia hypoglycemia. The in-licensed patents and applications relate to multiple hyperinsulinemic disorders, including PBH and HI. The patents, which are issued in the U.S. and Europe, provide protection until 2028. There are continuation applications pending from which we are pursuing additional claim coverage.
Other Proprietary Rights and Processes
We also rely on trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business, scientific, development or financial affairs that are either developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us are to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and disclose our technology. If these events happen, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets.
Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or based on the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property or that we have an exclusive royalty free license to use such technology.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Given the significant unmet medical need for novel therapies to treat Progeria, chronic hepatitis delta virus infection, congenital hyperinsulinism, post-bariatric hypoglycemia, and COVID-19, these conditions are where various treatments from many companies are used and where many public and private universities and research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery, research and development of product candidates. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive resources invested in the discovery and development of new products to treat these unmet medical needs. We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
In addition, there are numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies and large biotechnology companies currently marketing or pursuing the development of products or product candidates targeting the same indications as our product candidates. Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have or will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than us. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in developing or marketing products and technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly. Additionally, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly and may achieve more widespread market acceptance. Accelerated mergers and acquisitions activity in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
Our potential competitors and the related stage of development of their product candidates in target indications is as follows:
•HDV: Gilead (conditional approval in Europe, BLA submitted in the U.S.), Vir (Phase 2), Janssen Research & Development, LLC (Phase 2), Replicor, Inc. (Phase 2), PharmaEssentia (Phase 2), Albireo (preclinical), Assembly (preclinical)
•HGPS and Progeroid Laminopathies: PRG Science & Technology (Phase 1)
•HI: Zealand Pharmaceuticals (Phase 3), Rezolute, Inc (Phase 2b), Hamni (Phase 2), Crinetics (Phase 1)
•PBH: Xeris Pharmaceuticals (Phase 2), Vogenyx (Phase 2)
There are other therapies that are used or may be used for our targeted indications, and these other products in clinical development or marketed for other indications may be used in competition with our product candidates if we are able to identify potential market opportunities of interest. For example, HDV has not been generally identified as a target for development compared to hepatitis B or hepatitis C, and products on the market or in development for those indications may potentially be tested in HDV as the understanding of the potential medical need for therapies in this indication become more widely understood.
We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, product labeling, cost-effectiveness, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from the government and other third-parties. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated for any of our products if our competitors have products that are approved earlier than our product candidates or are superior compared to our product candidates or if our product candidates do not result in an improvement in condition compared to those other products.
License and Asset Purchase Agreements
License Agreement with Merck
In September 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Schering Corporation, subsequently acquired by Merck, which provides us with the exclusive right to develop and commercialize lonafarnib. As consideration for such exclusive right, we issued Private Eiger convertible preferred stock with a fair value of $0.5 million when the agreement was executed in September 2010. This preferred stock was converted to 27,350 shares of common stock upon the Merger. In addition, we are obligated to pay Merck up to an aggregate of $27.0 million in development milestones and will be required to pay tiered royalties based on aggregate annual net sales of all licensed products ranging from mid-single to low double-digit royalties on net sales. Our obligation to pay royalties to Merck expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of the expiration of the last to expire patent assigned to us under the agreement on the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product. In May 2015, the first regulatory milestone was achieved, and we paid the related milestone payment of $1.0 million to Merck. No additional milestone payments were incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. Upon completion of D-LIVR, we will owe Merck a $1.0 million milestone. We announced primary topline data of D-LIVR in December 2022, and the study is expected to complete by the end of 2023.
The Merck License will continue for so long as we owe royalty payments to Merck under the agreement. Each party has the right to terminate the Merck License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. Merck also has the right to terminate the agreement if we discontinue development and commercialization of LNF for a specified period of time. In addition, we have the right to terminate the agreement, with notice, for any reason.
On May 15, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the exclusive license agreement with Merck, which provides for expansion of the existing exclusively licensed field of use under the license agreement with Merck to include all uses of lonafarnib related to the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) in humans at no cost to us. We have the sole responsibility and the continuing obligation for the manufacture and supply of lonafarnib to The Progeria Research Foundation. Merck will not receive milestone payments in relation to lonafarnib for the treatment of HGPS and progeroid laminopathies or any royalty payments for sales of lonafarnib to treat the currently estimated HGPS and progeroid laminopathies patient population worldwide. On November 3, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the exclusive license agreement with Merck which expanded the definition of HGPS to also include progeroid laminopathies.
Asset Purchase Agreement with AbbVie Inc.
On November 20, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement (the AbbVie Agreement) with AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) to sell our Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher, which was awarded on November 20, 2020 upon approval by the FDA of our new drug application for Zokinvy® for HGPS and processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies (the PRV) to AbbVie. The AbbVie Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnification provisions subject to certain limitations. 
In consideration for the PRV, AbbVie agreed to pay us $95.0 million. The transaction closed in January 2021. Such consideration was shared equally with The Progeria Research Foundation (the PRF) in accordance with the terms of our Collaboration and Supply Agreement, dated May 15, 2018, with the PRF, pursuant to which we and the PRF will equally share any proceeds from the sale of a priority review voucher that we may receive as the sponsor of a rare pediatric disease product application. We retained approximately $46.5 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the PRV.
Asset Purchase Agreement with Eiger Group International, Inc.
In December 2010, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Eiger Group International, Inc. (EGI) dated December 8, 2010 (the EGI APA). Dr. Jeffrey Glenn, a member of our board of directors, is the sole owner of EGI.
Under the EGI APA, we purchased all the assets including intellectual property rights related to the use of farnesyltransferase inhibitors as anti-viral agents and methods to treat viral infection with those inhibitors. We also purchased all assets including intellectual property rights related to the use of inhibitors of prenylation, prenyl cysteine methyltransferase, and a specified protease as anti-viral agents and methods to treat viral infection with those inhibitors. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize the licensed products in major markets.
Under the EGI APA, we paid EGI an upfront payment of $0.4 million. Additionally, we are obligated to pay EGI a low single-digit royalty based on aggregate annual net sales of products developed using the intellectual property. Within the first ten years after commercialization, we may make a one-time payment of $0.5 million for each contract for the three types of product related to such intellectual property that would reduce the payment term for the three products to the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale. The obligation to pay royalties expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of either when the product is no longer sold in any country or the earliest of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product.
The term of the EGI APA extends until expiration of all payment obligations, and we may terminate the agreement upon notice to EGI. EGI may terminate the EGI APA if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products. In addition, each party may terminate the EGI APA for the other party’s uncured material breach or bankruptcy. In the event of any termination, other than termination by us for EGI’s breach, we will assign the purchased assets back to EGI.
In November 2012, we entered into an agreement with EGI whereby we sold all of the assets related to the compound clemizole, including any related intellectual property. EGI is obligated to pay to us a high single-digit royalty on future aggregate annual net sales, subject to certain reductions and exceptions. EGI’s obligation to pay royalties expires on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis on the later of either expiration of the last to expire patent sold to EGI under the agreement or the earliest of the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product. As of December 31, 2022, the product has not achieved regulatory approval.
Asset Purchase Agreement with Tracey McLaughlin and Colleen Craig
We entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with two individuals, Dr. Tracey McLaughlin and Dr. Colleen Craig (the Sellers) dated September 25, 2015 (the Exendin APA). We also entered into a consulting agreement with the Sellers as part of the agreement.
Under the Exendin APA, we purchased all the assets and the intellectual property rights related to the compound avexitide from the Sellers, including an assignment of a license agreement with Stanford which covered exclusive rights with respect to the compound avexitide. Under the assigned Stanford exclusive license agreement, we are obligated to pay Stanford a low, single-digit royalty on net sales after the first commercial sale of any product developed based on avexitide.
Under the Exendin APA, we are obligated to pay development milestone payments in aggregate up to $1.0 million to each of the Sellers and a low, single-digit royalty based on aggregate annual net sales of all products developed based on avexitide subject to certain reductions and exceptions. Our obligation to pay royalties expires on the expiration of the last to expire patent assigned to us under the agreement. We also agreed to retain each of the Sellers as consultants pursuant to consulting agreements, each with a term of one year, subject to annual renewal. The consulting agreements related to the Exendin APA have expired. During the year ended December 31, 2017, upon the successful completion of the Phase 2 trials, the development milestone was achieved, and we paid the related milestone payment of $0.1 million to each of the Sellers.
License Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
In April 2016, we entered into a License Agreement and a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, together BMS, the BMS Purchase Agreement and the BMS License Agreement. Under the BMS License Agreement, BMS granted us an exclusive, worldwide, license to research, develop, manufacture, and sell products 
containing the proprietary BMS molecule known as PEG-interferon Lambda-1a (peginterferon lambda or the Licensed Product) for all therapeutic and diagnostic uses in humans and animals. 
We are responsible for the development and commercialization of the Licensed Product at our sole cost and expense. In April 2016, under the BMS License Agreement we paid an upfront payment of $2.0 million in cash and issued 157,587 shares of our common stock to BMS with an aggregate fair value of $3.2 million. The BMS Purchase Agreement grants BMS certain registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock delivered, and BMS has agreed to certain trading and other restrictions with respect to the shares purchased.
Under the BMS License Agreement, we are obligated to make development and regulatory milestone payments totaling $61.0 million and commercial sales milestones of up to $128.0 million after the achievement of specified milestones. We are also obligated to pay BMS annual net sales royalties in the range of mid-single to mid-teens, depending on net sales levels. If we grant a sublicense, we are obligated to pay BMS a portion of the sublicensing income received. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a $3.0 million milestone expense that was triggered on successful demonstration of proof of concept in a Phase 2 clinical trial. In March 2022, we recorded a $5.0 million milestone expense related to the initiation of the Phase 3 LIMT-2 study of lambda for HDV. 
License Agreement with the Trustees of the UPenn and CHOP
In May 2019, we entered into a license agreement (the UPenn/CHOP Agreement) with the Trustees of the UPenn and the CHOP, under which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and sell certain GLP-1 receptor antagonist(s) products to treat all human and animal conditions. We also obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing, sublicensable, worldwide license to certain data developed by CHOP. We are responsible for the development and commercialization of the licensed products at our sole cost and expense.
As part of the consideration for the rights granted to us under the UPenn/CHOP Agreement, we paid UPenn a one-time, non-refundable issue fee of $1.0 million, which is recorded in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we are obligated to pay UPenn a specified annual license maintenance fee, up to $2.5 million in development milestones upon marketing authorization in one or more countries, and sales milestones of up to $18.0 million. We will also be required to pay UPenn a flat royalty in the low-single digits on our net sales of all licensed products, subject to specified reductions and offsets, and specified minimum annual royalty payments. Our obligation to pay royalties expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the later of: (i) the expiration of the last valid claim in the licensed patents in any country, or (ii) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. No milestones have been achieved as of December 31, 2022. 
We may terminate the UPenn/CHOP Agreement in its entirety for any reason by providing prior written notice to UPenn and CHOP. UPenn or CHOP may terminate the UPenn/CHOP Agreement, upon a written notice, for our failure to achieve the specified diligence milestones within the specified periods, subject to our extension rights.
Government Regulations and Product Approvals
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process
All of our current product candidates are subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act) and its implementing regulations. Our lambda product candidate is additionally subject to regulation as a biologic under the Public Health Service Act. The FDA subjects drugs and biologics to extensive pre and post market regulation. Failure to comply with the FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (NDAs), BLAs, withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal penalties.
FDA approval is required before any new biologic, drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved product, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a new product may be marketed in the United States is long, expensive, and inherently uncertain. Product development in the United States typically involves completion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests, submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated, performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and/or potency of the product for each indication for which FDA approval is sought, submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA, satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced, and FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product, disease or indication.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product’s chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to characterize and assess the potential safety, efficacy, purity and/or potency of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practice (GLP) regulations. These preclinical results are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about the product’s chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical studies including reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity may be initiated or continue after the IND is submitted.
An IND must become effective before United States clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the IND automatically becomes effective and the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. If the FDA raises any concerns or questions and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, a submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to human subjects under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, including good clinical practice (GCP) requirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials; and (ii) with protocols that detail, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, efficacy, purity and/or potency criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to and approved by an IRB at each study site before the study commences at that site and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients, or the IRB may impose other conditions. The study sponsor or the FDA may also suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Clinical trials to support an NDA or BLA for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although there is leeway to overlap or combine these phases.
•Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition, and is tested to assess safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological activity, and, when possible, to ascertain evidence of efficacy. The product candidate may also be tested in patients with severe or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The trials are conducted using a limited patient population for the purposes of preliminarily determining the effectiveness of the product in that particular indication, ascertaining dosage tolerance, discerning the optimal dosage, and identifying possible adverse effects and safety risks.
•Phase 3. If a compound demonstrates evidence of efficacy and has an acceptable safety profile in the Phase 2 clinical trials, then Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain additional information from an expanded and diverse patient population, at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in randomized controlled studies often with a double-blind design to maximize the reproducibility of the study results. Typically, a minimum of two positive Phase 3 clinical trials are submitted to support the product’s marketing application. These Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to provide sufficient data demonstrating evidence of the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of the product such that the FDA can evaluate the overall benefit-risk of the product and provide adequate information for the labeling and package insert for the product. Trials conducted outside of the United States under similar, GCP-compliant conditions in accordance with local applicable laws may also be acceptable to the FDA in support of product approval. 
Sponsors of clinical trials for investigational products must publicly disclose certain clinical trial information, including detailed trial design. These requirements are subject to specific timelines and apply to most Phase 3 clinical trials of FDA-regulated products.
In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post approval to gain more information about the product. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications. FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with other detailed information including compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The application must also contain extensive manufacturing information. The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to both a substantial application user fee and annual program user fees. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of applications. Standard applications are generally reviewed within ten months of filing, or twelve months from submission. Although the FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, it can extend these timelines if necessary, and FDA review may not occur on a timely basis. The FDA usually refers applications for novel products, or products that present difficult questions of safety, efficacy, purity and/or potency, to an advisory committee—a panel of independent experts, typically including clinicians and other scientific experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by 
the recommendation of the advisory committee, but it generally follows its recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one, or more, clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it verifies that compliance with cGMP requirements is satisfactory and that the manufacturing processes and facilities are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA will not approve a product unless the application contains data showing substantial evidence that it is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the application and conducts its inspections, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies contained in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application, including potentially significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we do. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of additional information requested. FDA approval is never guaranteed. The FDA may refuse to approve an application if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a product may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product’s package insert, or labeling.
In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guidelines, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, including dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS or use of a companion diagnostic with a product can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety, efficacy, purity and/or potency. The FDA may also condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or development of adequate controls and specifications.
Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards are not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fees for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
505(b)(2) NDA Pathway
As an alternative path to FDA approval, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This type of application permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on an FDA finding of safety, effectiveness or both for an approved drug product.
Orphan Drugs
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant an Orphan Drug designation to products intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally one that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting the NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the FDA publicly discloses the product’s identity and its intended orphan use. Orphan Drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first active moiety to be approved to treat a disease with FDA’s Orphan Drug designation is entitled to a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity in the United States for 
that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same orphan indication, regardless of patent status, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the Orphan Drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the product was designated. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different chemical/biological entity for the same disease or condition. An Orphan Drug designation also does not preclude the same product from being developed for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research expenses and a waiver of the application user fee.
Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designation by the FDA enables priority review voucher (PRV) eligibility upon U.S. market approval of a designated product for rare pediatric diseases. The RPD-PRV program is intended to encourage development of therapies to prevent and treat rare pediatric diseases. The voucher, which is awarded upon NDA or BLA approval to the sponsor of a designated RPD can be sold or transferred to another entity and used by the holder to receive priority review for a future NDA or BLA submission, which reduces the FDA review time of such future submission from ten to six months.
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA offers several expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive Breakthrough Therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers. PRIME designation by the EMA confers comparable benefits on qualifying drug product candidates.
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review). A product is eligible for accelerated approval if the product provides a meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over available treatments for a serious or life threatening condition, based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such product for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety, efficacy, purity and/or potency as those granted traditional approval and accelerated approval is typically contingent on a requirement to conduct additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. The FDA may withdraw approval using expedited procedures if, among other things, the sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval study with due diligence or a such study fails to verify and describe a clinical benefit.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
Advertising and Promotion
Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing post-approval regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity as well as significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct any deviations from the FDA’s standards. The FDA may also impose a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and the Company may face federal and/or state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
Products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new application or supplement before the change can be implemented. A supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs. Obtaining new indication is an important part of managing the life cycle of the product.
Adverse Event Reporting and cGMP Compliance
Recordkeeping, adverse event reporting and the submission of periodic reports are required following the FDA’s approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing or Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. In addition, the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. Furthermore, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies to assess compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution or withdraw approval for that product. Regulatory authorities may also withdraw product approvals, request product recalls, or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals upon discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in addition to the FDA. These other agencies include, without limitation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, as well as state and local governments. Such agencies enforce a variety of laws, including without limitation, anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, drug price reporting laws, and physician payment transparency laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been 
interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers, among others, on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years and statutory fines of up to $100,000. Additional criminal fines can be imposed under federal U.S. criminal procedure laws. Civil penalties include statutory amounts of up to $100,000 (adjusted for inflation) per violation, assessments of up to three times the total payments between the parties to the arrangement, and exclusion from participation in the federal healthcare programs or suspension from future participation in Medicare and Medicaid. Further, violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can also form the basis for False Claims Act liability (discussed below). 
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to or approval by the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes any request or demand for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product or other items or services of value to customers with the expectation that the customers would recommend the use of certain products or bill federal programs for such products. Companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of, for example, the alleged marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses, for the alleged submission of incorrect government price reporting data to certain Federal health care programs, for alleged violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and for other sales and marketing practices. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in civil penalties of up more than $25,000 per false claim or statement (an amount adjusted annually for inflation) plus three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs.
We may be subject to data privacy and information security laws and regulations, including both foreign and domestic, in the locations in which we conduct our business. HIPAA and its respective implementing regulations imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and requires the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Physician Payments Sunshine Act imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse midwives and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year.
Many states have similar laws and regulations that may differ from each other and federal law in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, states have anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope than analogous federal laws and may apply regardless of payer. In addition, state data privacy laws that protect the security of health information may differ from each other and may not be preempted by federal law. In addition, certain states require implementation of commercial compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities. Further, a number of states have enacted legislation designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Moreover, several states and local jurisdictions require the registration of sales representatives. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing and other activities with respect to any product candidate for which we receive approval to market in the United States by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
International Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution of products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we or our collaborators must obtain approval of the drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approve may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Further, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to additional foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA) either under the so-called centralized or national (mutual-recognition or decentralized) authorization procedures. A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. In the case of pediatric patients, Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended, provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the EU, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA‑approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product‑specific waiver, (2) a class waiver, or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission following a favorable opinion by the EMA that is valid in all EU Member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases, other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for other products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health or which contain a new active substance for indications other than those specified to be compulsory. 
The EMA grants Orphan Drug designation to promote the development of products for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, Orphan Drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition in the EU and without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the investment required to develop the drug. Orphan Drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed Orphan Drug will be of significant benefit to patients. Orphan Drug designation provides opportunities for free or reduced-fee protocol assistance, fee reductions for marketing authorization applications and other post-authorization activities and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval, which can be extended to 12 years if trials are conducted in 
accordance with an agreed-upon pediatric investigational plan. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
The EMA may grant eligibility to the Priority Medicines (PRIME) Scheme to support the development of promising medicines that target an unmet medical need, i.e., medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients with no current treatment options for their disease. Through PRIME, the EMA grants proactive support to medicine developers to optimize the generation of robust data on a medicine’s benefits and risks, and enable accelerated assessment of medicines applications.
Foreign data protection laws, including, without limitation, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR), the EU GDPR as transposed into the national laws of the United Kingdom by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (withdrawal) Act 2018 as the UK GDPR (the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, together the GDPR), the UK Data Protection, 2018 and European Union (EU) Member State and English data protection legislation, also apply to health-related and other personal information that we process, including, without limitation, personal information relating to clinical trial participants in the EU and/or the UK. The GDPR imposes significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal information, including, among other things, to: (i) implement administrative, physical, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect personal information; (ii) establish an appropriate and valid legal basis for processing personal information; (iii) comply with accountability and transparency requirements regarding the processing of personal information, which require controllers to demonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR and to provide more detailed information to data subjects regarding processing; (iv) comply with data protection rights of data subjects including a right of access to and rectification of personal information a right to obtain restriction of processing or to object to processing of personal information, a right to ask for a copy of personal information to be provided to a third party in a useable format and erasing personal information in certain circumstances; (v) report certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority without undue delay (and no later than 72, where feasible); (vi), obtain explicit consent for collection of sensitive personal information such as health data; and (vii) consider data protection as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal information processed. In addition, the GDPR prohibits the international transfer of personal information outside of the EU and/or the UK including to the U.S., unless made to a country deemed to have adequate data privacy laws by the European Commission and/or the UK or a data transfer mechanism in accordance with the GDPR (as applicable) has been put in place. 
The GDPR allows EU Member States and the UK (as applicable) to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of personal information, including genetic, biometric and health data. 
The GDPR also introduces fines of up to €20 million (under the EU GDPR) or £17.5 million (under the UK GDPR) or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the non-compliant company, whichever is greater, for serious violations of certain of the GDPR’s requirements. The GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the level of fines to impose (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement). Data subjects also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress). Complying with the GDPR may cause us to incur substantial operational and compliance costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite our efforts to bring practices into compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of vendor cooperation. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, regulators, customers, data subjects, suppliers, vendors or other parties. Further, there is a risk that the measures will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within the business will not be fully compliant with the new procedures. If there are breaches of these measures, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions as well as reputational damage which may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and many other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers, and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the 
drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover Zokinvy or any of our product candidates once approved could reduce physician utilization of such products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process. 
We expect that 50% to 70% of US patients who are eligible for treatment with Zokinvy will be covered by insurance through a federal healthcare program such as Medicaid, and the remaining patients will be covered by commercial insurance. We have had active engagement with payers that cover the lives of identified patients with Progeria and processing-deficient progeroid laminopathies.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. Additionally, coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more of our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, price transparency measures, inflation rebates, drug price negotiation programs for certain products, and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that third-party payors will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to reform the delivery and payment for healthcare items and services. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. This law was designed to expand access to health insurance coverage for uninsured and underinsured individuals while containing overall healthcare costs. The framework of the ACA and other healthcare reforms continues to evolve as a result of executive, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments. For example, Congress has enacted several laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA, such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, the health insurer tax. More recently, for calendar years 2021 and 2022, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 temporarily increased premium tax credit assistance established under the ACA to help eligible individuals cover premiums for health insurance purchased through the health insurance marketplace and removed the 400% federal poverty level limit that otherwise applies for purposes of eligibility to receive premium tax credits. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended this increased tax credit assistance and removal of the 400% federal poverty limit through 2025. On January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order instructing certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. The ACA has also faced various judicial challenges, and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court 
dismissed a challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. It is unclear how any future healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to repeal, amend or replace the ACA will impact the ACA, and our business. 
Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in Congressional and federal agency inquiries regarding pricing and related practices, as well as proposed and enacted federal and state legislation and regulation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products For example, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 included among its provisions a sunset of the ACA’s cap on pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Previously, under the ACA, manufacturers’ rebate liability was capped at 100% of the average manufacturer price for a covered outpatient drug. Effective January 1, 2024, manufacturers’ Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebate liability will no longer be capped, potentially resulting in a manufacturer paying more in Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates than it receives on the sale of certain covered outpatient drugs. 
Additionally, on July 9, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order to promote competition in the U.S. economy that included several initiatives addressing prescription drugs. Among other provisions, the Executive Order stated that the Biden administration will “support aggressive legislative reforms that would lower prescription drug prices, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and through other related reforms.” In response to the Executive Order, on September 9, 2021, HHS issued a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that identified potential legislative policies and administrative tools that Congress and the agency can pursue in order to make drug prices more affordable and equitable, improve and promote competition throughout the prescription drug industry, and foster scientific innovation. In August 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which implements substantial changes to the Medicare program, including drug pricing reforms and changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design. Among other reforms, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes inflation rebates on drug manufacturers for products reimbursed under Medicare Parts B and D if the prices of those products increase faster than inflation; implements changes to the Medicare Part D benefit that, beginning in 2025, will cap benefit annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000, while imposing new discount obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers; and, beginning in 2026, establishes a “maximum fair price” for a fixed number of pharmaceutical and biological products covered under Medicare Parts B and D following a price negotiation process with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Furthermore, the Biden administration continues to direct HHS to consider new healthcare payment and delivery models that would lower drug costs and promote access to innovative therapies for beneficiaries enrolled in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, at the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Policy changes, including potential modification or repeal of all or parts of the ACA or the implementation of new health care legislation, could result in significant changes to the health care system, which may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or lower pricing for our product candidates, or additional pricing pressures.
In the United States, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. For example, in the United States, there have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Furthermore, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products can only be effectively marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials in order to compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states may 
allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross- border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
In December 2021, Regulation (EU) 2021/2282 on HTA, or HTA Regulation, was adopted. The HTA Regulation will apply as from 12 January 2025. It particularly replaces the current system based on the voluntary network of national authorities, and the new framework covers joint clinical assessments, joint scientific consultations, the identification of emerging health technologies, and voluntary cooperation for the national authorities. The HTA Regulation aims to provide a transparent and inclusive framework for health technology assessments in the EU, and it will help EU countries determine the effectiveness and value of new technologies and decide on pricing and reimbursement by health insurers or health systems.
