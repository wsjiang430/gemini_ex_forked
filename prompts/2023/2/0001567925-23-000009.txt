Item 1. Business.
General Description of Business and Operations
Sila Realty Trust, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that was formed on January 11, 2013, headquartered in Tampa, Florida, that has elected, and currently qualifies, to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or a REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for federal income tax purposes. Substantially all of Sila Realty Trust, Inc.'s business is conducted through Sila Realty Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, or the Operating Partnership. Sila Realty Trust, Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and directly owns 100% of the Operating Partnership. Except as the context otherwise requires, “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” refer to Sila Realty Trust, Inc., our Operating Partnership and all wholly-owned subsidiaries. 
We invest in high-quality properties leased to long-term tenants. We are primarily focused on investing in healthcare assets across the continuum of care, with emphasis on lower cost patient settings, which, we believe, typically generate predictable, durable and growing income streams. We may also make other real estate-related investments, which may include equity or debt interests in other real estate entities.
We formerly invested in data center properties. During the second quarter of 2021, our board of directors, or the Board, made a determination to sell our data center properties. On May 19, 2021, we and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a purchase and sale agreement, or the PSA, for the sale of up to 29 data center properties owned by us, which constituted the entirety of our data center segment, or the Data Center Sale. On July 22, 2021, we completed the sale of all 29 of the data center properties for an aggregate sale price of $1,320,000,000, and generated net proceeds of approximately $1,295,367,000. Concurrently, the Board declared a special cash distribution of $1.75 per share of Class A, Class I, Class T and Class T2 shares of common stock. The special cash distribution was funded with the proceeds from the sale of the data center properties. The special cash distribution was paid on July 30, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 26, 2021, in the aggregate amount of approximately $392,685,000. The decision of the Board to sell the data center properties, as well as the execution of the PSA, represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our results and operations for the periods presented. As of December 31, 2021 and subsequent, we had no assets or liabilities related to the data center segment. The operations of the data center segment have been classified as income from discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
Prior to September 30, 2020, our former advisor was responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying and making investments on our behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement among us, the Operating Partnership and our former advisor. On July 28, 2020, we and the Operating Partnership entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, to provide for the internalization of the external management functions previously performed for us and the Operating Partnership by our former advisor and its affiliates, or the Internalization Transaction. On September 30, 2020, we closed the Internalization Transaction. Effective September 30, 2020, as a result of the Internalization Transaction, our former advisor is no longer affiliated with us. Upon completion of the Internalization Transaction, individuals who were previously employed by an affiliate of our former advisor became employees of us and the functions previously performed by our former advisor were internalized by us. As an internally managed company, we no longer pay our former advisor and its affiliates any fees or expense reimbursements arising from the advisory agreement.
We raised the equity capital for our real estate investments through two public offerings, or our Offerings, from May 2014 through November 2018, and we have offered shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, or the DRIP, pursuant to two Registration Statements on Form S-3, together the DRIP Offerings and each a DRIP Offering, since November 2017. As of December 31, 2022, we had accepted investors’ subscriptions for and issued approximately 157,508,000 shares of Class A, Class I, Class T and Class T2 common stock in our Offerings, resulting in receipt of gross proceeds of approximately $1,520,086,000, before share repurchases of $135,701,000, selling commissions and dealer manager fees of approximately $96,734,000 and other offering costs of approximately $27,631,000.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 132 real estate healthcare properties, comprised of approximately 5,535,000 rentable square feet of single-tenant and multi-tenant commercial spaces, and two undeveloped land parcels. As of December 31, 2022, the rentable space of these real estate healthcare properties was 99.5% leased. 
We have historically established, and intend to continue to establish, an estimated per share net asset value, or Estimated Per Share NAV, on at least an annual basis. Each Estimated Per Share NAV was determined by the Board, after consultation with an independent third-party valuation firm. The Estimated Per Share NAV is not subject to audit by our independent registered public accounting firm. The Estimated Per Share NAV was calculated for purposes of assisting broker-dealers participating in public offerings in meeting their customer account statement reporting obligations under the National 
Table of Contents

Association of Securities Dealers Conduct Rule 2340. The following table outlines the established Estimated Per Share NAV as determined by the Board for the last three years as of each valuation date presented below:
Valuation Date | Effective Date | Estimated Per Share NAV | 
October 31, 2019 | December 18, 2019 | $8.65 | 
September 30, 2020 | December 8, 2020 | $8.69 | 
May 31, 2021 | July 26, 2021 | $9.95 | (1)
May 31, 2021 | July 26, 2021 | $8.20 | (1)
June 30, 2022 | August 25, 2022 | $8.22 | 

(1)On July 22, 2021, we announced the Estimated Per Share NAV that the Board, at the recommendation of our audit committee, or the Audit Committee, approved on July 20, 2021, which was calculated as of May 31, 2021, of $9.95. Upon the declaration of a special cash distribution of $1.75 per share to stockholders of record on July 26, 2021, the new Estimated Per Share NAV was $8.20.
Key Developments During 2022 and Subsequent
•During the year ended December 31, 2022, we purchased seven operating healthcare properties, in five separate transactions, comprising approximately 244,000 rentable square feet for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $157,194,000. In addition, we placed one operating healthcare property into service.
•During the year ended December 31, 2022, we sold one land parcel that formerly contained a healthcare property for an aggregate sale price of $24,000,000 and generated net proceeds of $22,701,000.
•During the year ended December 31, 2022, we, the Operating Partnership and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement, or the Revolving Credit Agreement, with Truist Bank, as Administrative Agent for the lenders, for aggregate commitments available of up to $500,000,000, which may be increased, subject to lender approval, through incremental term loans and/or revolving loan commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000,000,000. The maturity date for the Revolving Credit Agreement is February 15, 2026, which, at our election, may be extended for a period of six-months on no more than two occasions, subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee. Simultaneously with the Revolving Credit Agreement’s execution, on February 15, 2022, we, the Operating Partnership, and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a senior unsecured term loan agreement, or the 2024 Term Loan Agreement, with Truist Bank, as Administrative Agent for the lenders. The 2024 Term Loan Agreement, with aggregate commitments of up to $300,000,000, may be increased, subject to lender approval, to an aggregate amount not to exceed $600,000,000. In addition, we, the Operating Partnership and certain of our subsidiaries, entered into a new senior unsecured term loan agreement, or the 2028 Term Loan Agreement, with Truist Bank, as Administrative Agent for the lenders, with aggregate commitments of up to $275,000,000. The Revolving Credit Agreement was entered into to replace our prior revolving line of credit, which had a maturity date of April 27, 2022, with the option to extend for one twelve-month period. We did not exercise the option to extend. Upon closing of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we extinguished all commitments associated with the prior revolving line of credit. The 2024 Term Loan Agreement was entered into to replace our prior term loan, which was paid off in its entirety upon closing of the Revolving Credit Agreement and the 2024 Term Loan Agreement. We refer to the 2028 Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the 2024 Term Loan Agreement, collectively, as the “Unsecured Credit Facility,” which has aggregate commitments available of $1,075,000,000. At our election, loans under the Unsecured Credit Facility may be made as Base Rate Loans or Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, Loans. See Part II, Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources," for additional information.
•As of March 10, 2023, we owned 132 real estate healthcare properties, comprising approximately 5,535,000 rentable square feet of single-tenant and multi-tenant commercial spaces. As of March 10, 2023, the rentable space of our healthcare properties was 99.5% leased. Additionally, we owned two undeveloped land parcels as of March 10, 2023.
•As of March 10, 2023, we had an outstanding principal balance of $575,000,000 under our Unsecured Credit Facility.
Investment Objectives and Policies
Our primary investment objectives at this time are to:
•acquire high quality healthcare properties leased to tenants along the continuum of care, capitalizing on critical and structural economic growth drivers; 
Table of Contents

•pay regular cash distributions to stockholders;
•preserve, protect and return capital contributions to stockholders;
•realize appreciated growth in the value of our investments upon the sale of such investments in whole or in part; and
•be prudent, patient and deliberate with respect to the purchase and sale of our investments considering current and future real estate markets.
We cannot assure stockholders that we will attain these objectives or that the value of our assets will not decrease. Furthermore, within our investment objectives and policies, we have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments and the purchase and sale of our assets, subject to the approval of the Board. The Board may revise our investment objectives and policies if it determines that it is in the best interest of our stockholders.
Investment Strategy
We focus our investment activities on acquiring preferably net-leased properties that are primarily in the healthcare sector. We currently expect that most of our properties will continue to be located throughout the continental United States; however, we may purchase properties in other jurisdictions. We may also invest in real estate-related debt and equity securities that meet our investment strategy and return criteria. We evaluate our assets in an effort to avoid any investments that would cause us to fail to maintain our REIT status or cause us or any of our subsidiaries to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
We seek to obtain investments that are (i) essential to the successful business operations of the tenants; (ii) leased to creditworthy and investment grade tenants, preferably on a net-leased basis; (iii) long-term leases, preferably with terms of six years or longer, which typically include annual or periodic fixed rental increases; and (iv) located in geographically diverse, established markets with superior access and visibility.
We may acquire properties in various stages of development or that require substantial refurbishment or renovation. This determination is made based upon a variety of factors, including the available risk-adjusted returns for such properties when compared with other available properties, the effect such properties would have on the diversification of our portfolio, and our investment objectives of realizing both current income and capital appreciation upon the sale of such properties.
We endeavor to achieve a well-balanced portfolio of real estate investments that is diversified by tenancy, geographic location, age and lease maturities. We seek to acquire properties primarily in the high-growth healthcare sector and tenants of the properties that are diversified between national, regional and local entities.
Creditworthy Tenants
We expect the tenants and/or sponsors of the tenants of our healthcare properties to be creditworthy national or regional companies generally with high net worth and high operating income.
A tenant is considered creditworthy if it has a financial profile that we believe meets our criteria. In evaluating the creditworthiness of a current tenant or a prospective tenant, we consider various factors, including, but not limited to, the proposed terms of the property acquisition, the financial condition of the tenant and/or the sponsor, the operating history of the property with the tenant, the tenant’s market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant’s industry segment, and the lease length and other lease terms at the time of the property acquisition.
We monitor the credit of our tenants in an effort to stay abreast of any material changes in credit quality. We monitor tenant credit by: (1) reviewing the credit ratings of tenants (or their parent companies) that are rated by nationally recognized rating agencies; (2) reviewing financial statements that are publicly available or that are required to be delivered to us under the applicable lease; (3) monitoring industry reports and other available information regarding our tenants and their underlying businesses; (4) monitoring the timeliness of rent collections; and (5) conducting periodic inspections of our properties to ascertain proper maintenance, repair and upkeep.
Investment Decisions
In evaluating investments in properties, we consider various factors, including, to the extent such information is available with respect to such property, the following:
•proposed purchase price, terms and conditions;
•physical condition, age, curb appeal and environmental reports;
•location, visibility and access;
•historical financial performance;
Table of Contents

•tenant rent roll and tenant creditworthiness;
•lease terms, including rent, rent increases, length of lease term, specific tenant and landlord responsibilities, renewal, expansion, termination, purchase options, exclusive and permitted uses provisions, assignment and sublease provisions, and co-tenancy requirements;
•local market economic conditions, demographics and population growth patterns;
•neighboring properties; and
•potential for new property construction in the area.
Investing in and Originating Loans
Our criteria for originating or acquiring loans are substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties. We may invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans. Further, we may invest in unsecured loans or loans secured by assets other than real estate.
Our underwriting process typically involves comprehensive financial, structural, operational and legal due diligence. We do not require an appraisal of the underlying property from a certified independent appraiser for an investment in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans.
We may originate loans from mortgage brokers or personal solicitations of suitable borrowers, or we may purchase existing loans that were originated by other lenders. We evaluate all potential loan investments to decide whether the term of the loan, the security for the loan and the loan-to-value ratio meet our investment criteria and objectives.
Investing in Real Estate Securities
We may invest in non-majority owned securities of both publicly-traded and private companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses, including REITs and other real estate operating companies, and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets. We may purchase the common stock, preferred stock, debt, or other securities of these entities or options to acquire such securities.
Acquisition Structure
We have and expect to continue to acquire fee interests in properties (a fee interest is the absolute, legal possession and ownership of land, property, or rights), although we may utilize other methods of acquiring a property if we deem them to be advantageous.
In an effort to achieve our investment objectives, and to further diversify our portfolio, we have invested and expect to continue to invest in properties using various acquisition structures, which could include direct and indirect acquisitions, joint ventures, leveraged investments, issuing units in our Operating Partnership in exchange for properties and making mortgages or other loans secured by the same types of properties which we may acquire.
Joint Ventures
We may enter into joint ventures, partnerships and other co-ownership partnerships for the purpose of making investments. Some of the potential reasons to enter into a joint venture may be to acquire assets we could not otherwise acquire, to reduce our capital commitment to a particular asset, or to benefit from certain expertise a partner might have. In determining whether to invest in a particular joint venture, we evaluate the assets of the joint venture under the criteria described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the selection of our investments. We also evaluate the terms of the joint venture, as well as the financial condition, operating capabilities and integrity of our partner or partners.
Disposition Policy
We typically intend to hold each asset we acquire for an extended period of time. However, circumstances may arise that could result in the sale of some assets earlier than initially expected. The determination of whether an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of is made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, specific real estate market conditions, tax implications for our stockholders, and other factors. The requirements for qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes may put some limits on our ability to sell assets after short holding periods.
Financing Strategy and Policies
We believe that utilizing borrowing is consistent with our investment objectives and has the potential to maximize returns to our stockholders. Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at a later time. In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, tenant improvements, leasing commissions and other working capital needs. The form of our indebtedness will vary and could 
Table of Contents

be long-term or short-term, secured or unsecured, or fixed-rate or floating rate. We will not enter into interest rate swaps or caps, or similar hedging transactions or derivative arrangements for speculative purposes, but may do so in order to manage or mitigate our interest rate risk on variable rate debt.
Distribution Policy
The amount of distributions we pay to our stockholders is determined by the Board and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code and restrictions imposed by our organizational documents and Maryland law.
We currently pay, and intend to continue to pay, distributions to our stockholders. If we do not have enough cash from operations to fund distributions, we may sell assets in order to fund distributions, or make distributions out of net proceeds from potential future offerings. We have paid, and may continue to pay, distributions from sources other than from our cash flows from operations. Subject to certain exceptions, there is no limit to the amount of distributions that we may pay out of net proceeds from potential future offerings.
In accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
To the extent that distributions to our stockholders are paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, such distributions are taxable as ordinary income. To the extent that our distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital to our stockholders for federal income tax purposes, to the extent of their basis in their stock, and thereafter will constitute a capital gain. 
See Part II, Item 5. "Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities—Distributions," for further discussion on distribution rates approved by the Board.
Competition
As we purchase properties for our portfolio, we are in competition with other potential buyers (some of whom have more cash, available liquidity, and/or offer competitive advantages versus us in the acquisition of properties) for the same properties and may have to pay more to purchase the property than if there were no other potential acquirers, or we may have to locate another property that meets our investment criteria. Although we generally acquire properties subject to existing leases, the leasing of real estate is highly competitive in the current market, and we may experience competition for tenants from owners and managers of competing projects. As a result, we may have to provide free rent, incur charges for tenant improvements, or offer other inducements, or we might not be able to timely lease the space, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. At the time we determine to dispose of our properties, we are typically in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for our properties.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Tenants
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash on deposit in certain financial institutions that had deposits in excess of current federally insured levels. We limit cash investments to financial institutions with high credit standing; therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on our cash deposits. To date, we have not experienced any loss of or lack of access to cash in our accounts.
The following table shows the tenant that accounted for 10% or more of our rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022: 

Tenant | Total Numberof Leases | Leased Sq Ft | | 2022 Rental Revenue (in thousands) | Percentage of2022 Rental Revenue
Post Acute Medical, LLC, and its affiliates (1) | 15 | | 708,817 | | $ | 27,279 | 15.2 | %

(1)    The leases are with tenants under the common control of Post Acute Medical, LLC and its affiliates and have lease expiration dates between 2030 and 2042.

Compliance with Governmental Regulations
Our real estate properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory laws and requirements, including, but not limited to, zoning regulations, building codes and land use laws and building, accessibility, occupancy and other permit requirements. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of governmental fines or an award of damages to private litigants. While we believe that we are currently in material compliance with these regulatory requirements, the requirements may change or new requirements may be imposed that could require significant unanticipated expenditures by us. Significant regulatory requirements include the laws and regulations described below.
REIT Laws and Regulations
We elected, and qualify, to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to currently distribute at least 90.0% of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders.
If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT in any taxable year, we would then be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and would not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
All real estate properties and the operations conducted on the real estate properties are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. In connection with ownership and operation of real estate, we may be potentially liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters. We intend to take all reasonable steps to fully comply with these laws, including obtaining environmental assessments of all properties that we acquire. We obtain Phase I Environmental Assessment Reports, and as needed, further environmental due diligence, including but not limited to Phase II Environmental Assessment Reports, upon each property acquisition, and, if determined necessary, during our period of ownership, to ensure that the properties that we acquire and own are free of environmental contamination and hazardous substances. We also carry environmental liability insurance on our properties, which provides coverage for pollution liability, for third-party bodily injury and property damage claims.
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
We are committed to maintaining healthy, prosperous, and sustainable communities through thoughtful stewardship of the environment and conscientious management of our own corporate culture. In early 2022, the Board established the Environmental, Social and Governance Steering Committee, or the ESG Steering Committee, led by members of our management team and other senior managers. The ESG Steering Committee meets at least quarterly to discuss our strategy, initiatives, and progress, in support of our on-going commitment to corporate governance, social responsibility, environmental matters, sustainability, health and safety.
Environmental
 Taking aim at climate concerns and employees' desire for workplace flexibility, we established a hybrid workplace model. In January 2022, we leased Class A Office space in a newly constructed building that intends to deliver a restorative professional environment that cultivates productivity, collaboration, engagement, and balance. The neighborhood in which the new office building is located is part of a community that has achieved the WELL Design & Operations designation under the WELL Community Standard, the first neighborhood to do so globally. The WELL Building Standard takes a holistic approach to health in the built environment addressing behavior, operations and design. The building is WELL Gold v2 Certified and LEED Silver Certified.

Social and Governance 
Corporate Culture: Our strong tone at the top begins with the Board, which has demonstrated its focus on advancing openness, honesty, fairness and integrity within the Company. Ethical behavior is an important cornerstone of our Company’s continued success and each of us has an obligation to report any accounting irregularity, theft, discrimination, harassment or other violation of the law. We are committed to creating an open and accountable workplace where employees feel empowered to speak up and raise issues. With this in mind, we provide multiple channels to speak up, ask for guidance, and report concerns. We continue to prioritize having "The Right People, In The Right Places, Doing The Right Things." In 2022, we were recognized as fourteenth place in the Tampa Bay Business Journal 2022 Best Places to Work contest in the Large Business Category. The survey results from the competition revealed that our employees feel recognized for their performance, are valued and cared for as employees and individuals, and have great trust in senior leaders to guide the Company to future success. We have once again been nominated by our valued employees for this notable award in 2023.
Core Values: We believe that our employees are aligned around core values that inspire our behavior as individuals and as an organization. Our core values are essential to the Company's culture. These values are critical to the success of the Company and are aligned with the Company's mission and vision statements. They define expectations for how all employees collaborate, communicate, interact and perform their roles within the Company. They describe for each employee the expectation of how "I ACT" and that is with Integrity, with Accountability, with transparent and honest Communication and by embracing Teamwork. 
Social Impact and Community: Our mission is to engage, inspire, and empower our employees to make a positive impact on our community where we work and live. We strive to support each of our employees in engaging in the community in areas where they are passionate about and taking on causes that are personally meaningful to them. Employees are encouraged to drive positive change by dedicating their time and money to non-profit organizations. The Company has a volunteer program whereby employees are provided three paid days each year to use for service to the community. Our social impact programs are in support of several non-for-profit organizations. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 54 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We aim to act with the highest integrity and operate with the highest ethical standards as we strive to create and maintain an inclusive work environment that values the uniqueness of each individual, and his or her ideas and experiences. We endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, or any other status protected by applicable law. We conduct annual training designed to prevent harassment and discrimination and monitor employee conduct year-round. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement at the Company is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. We believe that our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, or any other status protected by applicable law and are routinely recognized for outstanding performance. Our compensation and benefits program is designed to attract and retain talent and we review our compensation and benefits against market and industry benchmarks to ensure they are competitive. Our employees are offered significant flexibility to meet personal and family needs.
