ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company specializing in the development and commercialization of novel T cell-based immunotherapies for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumor indications. We developed our lead product candidates from our multiTAA-specific T cell technology, which is based on the manufacture of non-engineered, tumor-specific T cells that recognize multiple tumor associated antigens, or TAAs. MultiTAA-specific T cells are able to recognize multiple tumor targets to produce broad spectrum anti-tumor activity. When infused into a cancer patient, the multiTAA-specific T cells are designed to kill cancer cells expressing the TAA and potentially recruit the patient’s immune system to participate in the cancer killing process.
We licensed the underlying technology for multiTAA-specific T cell therapy from Baylor College of Medicine, or BCM, in March 2018. BCM had utilized the therapy in seven exploratory clinical trials. In these studies, BCM treated over 150 patients suffering from a variety of cancers including lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and various sarcomas. In those studies, BCM saw evidence of clinical benefit, expansion of infused cells epitope spreading, and decreased toxicity compared to other cellular therapies.
We are advancing three product candidates as part of our multiTAA-specific T cell program for:

1. | autologous treatment of lymphoma, and selected solid tumors
---+------------------------------------------------------------


2. | allogeneic T cells for the treatment of AML
---+--------------------------------------------


3. | off-the-shelf products in various indications
---+----------------------------------------------

We do not genetically engineer our multiTAA-specific T cell therapies and we believe that our product candidates are superior to T cells engineered with chimeric antigen receptors, or CAR-T, for several reasons including:

● | Multiple targets → enhanced tumoricidal effect→ minimized tumor immune escape
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Epitope spreading → broad patient T cell expansion → durable endogenous antitumor immune response
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical safety → no reported cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or other severe adverse effects (SAEs) in our clinical trials to date
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Standard IV administration → outpatient treatment → enhanced accessibility
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Non-engineered → reduced manufacturing complexity → lower cost
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

1



For these reasons, we believe our endogenous T cell receptor-based therapies may provide meaningful clinical benefit and safety to patients with both liquid and solid tumors.
We believe that the simplicity of our manufacturing process allows additional modifications to expand multiTAA-specific T cell recognition of cancer targets. For example, we are currently analyzing the potential for a 12-antigen multiTAA-specific T cell therapy. We are also assessing the potential of combining multiTAA-specific T cell products with other products.
We have positioned ourselves to be in full control of our research and development and clinical manufacturing needs by establishing a fully validated, FDA registered, manufacturing facility. We believe that this has key advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, particularly because we are less reliant on contract manufacturing organizations, which are expensive and often have long lead times, shortages of skilled labor and a backlog of customers.
Company-Sponsored Clinical Development of Multi-TAA Specific T Cell Therapies
MT-401 for the Treatment of Post-Transplant AML
We are pursuing post-transplant AML as the lead indication for our first company-sponsored multiTAA-specific T cell program in the ARTEMIS study. We submitted an investigational new drug, or IND, application to the FDA, to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of multiTAA-specific T cell therapy, which we refer to as MT-401 (zedenoleucel), in post-allogeneic HSCT patients with AML in both the adjuvant and active disease setting. The dose administered in this multicenter trial is currently 200 million cells every two weeks for three doses. In the adjuvant setting, patients will be randomized to either multiTAA-specific T cell therapy or standard of care (observation) at approximately 90 days post-transplant, while the active disease patients will receive MT-401 following relapse post-transplant as part of a single-arm group.

● | In April 2020, the Orphan Product Development Office of the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, granted orphan drug designation to MT-401 (zedenoleucel), a multiTAA-specific T cell therapy that targets four TAAs, for the treatment of AML.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The same multiTAA-specific T cell therapy has been well tolerated in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, conducted by our strategic partner Baylor College of Medicine, or BCM.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As reported in a 2021 publication by Lulla et al., 11 of the 17 patients in the adjuvant disease setting dosed with the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy after receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or HSCT, never relapsed [median leukemia-free survival, or LFS, not reached at a median follow-up of 1.9 years], with 11 of 15 patients (two patients were each treated during two different remissions) remaining alive (estimated two-year overall survival of 77%) at a median follow-up of
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.9 years post-infusion, which compares favorably with HSCT outcomes for risk-matched AML/MDS patients post-HSCT [median LFS of nine to 15 months and two-year survival probability of 42%].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Additionally, eight patients were treated for active disease that was resistant to salvage therapy post-HSCT with a median of five prior lines of therapy (range: four to 10).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | One of the eight patients crossed over from the adjuvant group, while two patients enrolled twice, but all three patients had active AML that failed another line of salvage therapy after their first multiTAA-specific T cell infusion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Two of the eight patients achieved objective responses, with one complete response and one partial response, with six patients continuing with stable disease.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | We have observed evidence of a patient’s natural immune system participating in cancer killing (epitope spreading) after infusion of our multiTAA-specific T cell therapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ARTEMIS trial conducted by Marker has completed in June 2021 the safety lead-in portion, which tested the comparability of MT-401 or zedenoleucel, the multiTAA-specific T cell product manufactured using peptides from two different vendors and enrolled six patients with active disease: one measurable residual disease (MRD) positive patient and five frank relapse patients.

● | Consistent with the results of the BCM Phase 1 trial, there were no dose-limiting toxicities, cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity observed in this stage of the trial, and one MRD+ patient became MRD- after infusion of MT-401. Correlative studies showed that the patient saw significant expansion of infused multiTAA-specific T cells in addition to extensive epitope spreading. There were no objective responses from the frank relapse patients. By November 2022, all six patients had completed dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) periods with no DLTs reported.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the fourth quarter of 2021, the manufacturing of MT-401 for the Phase 2 trial started at the Marker Cell Therapy cGMP manufacturing facility, named MCTF01. The Company transitioned to treating patients using MT-401 manufactured with Marker’s new T cell manufacturing process. Specifically, the new process involves an improved T cell manufacturing process for MT-401 that reduces production time to 9 days (compared to the original process of >30 days). This new process enabled a >90% reduction in the number of operator interventions during production and an improved final T cell product candidate compared to the original product candidate used in the ARTEMIS trial. These process improvements have yielded an MT-401 product candidate that has five times the measurable specificity and four times the potency in terms of tumor killing as compared to the prior manufacturing process. We have now treated 12 patients with MT-401 manufactured using our improved manufacturing process, with 16 patients treated with MT-401 manufactured using the original process, for a total of 28 patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | After completing the safety lead-in portion, we initiated the remainder of the Phase 2 trial in July 2021, in which we intend to enroll 210 patients at approximately 20 transplant centers. Group 1 will comprise of 150 adjuvant (disease-free) patients, with the primary endpoint of relapse-free survival of patients randomized to receive MT-401 versus a control group. Group 2 will comprise of 60 active disease patients in a single arm, with primary endpoints of complete remission and duration of complete remission.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To date, a total of 11 patients in the adjuvant arm of the ARTEMIS study have been randomized to treatment with MT-401 using a new manufacturing process or to standard-of-care. All patients are too early for evaluation, but the Data Monitoring Committee has reviewed the existing safety data and has not identified any concerns.
A total of four MRD+ patients have been treated and are currently evaluable. Two MRD+ patients were treated with MT-401 manufactured using the original manufacturing process and showed elimination of detectable disease. Two additional MRD+ patients were treated with MT-401 manufactured used in the improved process.

● | The first MRD+ patient was treated at 100 x 106 cells per infusion and was able to remain in stable disease for six months, allowing the patient to bridge to a second allogeneic transplant.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | The second MRD+ patient was dosed at 200 x 106 cells per infusion and the PCR value, which proved to be a valuable tool for detecting MRD, has decreased by 70% only four weeks after the last infusion. This patient’s disease status will continue to be closely monitored and evaluated.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A fifth MRD+ patient has been treated with MT-401 manufactured used in the improved process but is too early for evaluation. Additional MRD+ patients have been enrolled and are awaiting treatment.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We anticipate reporting a data readout of the MRD+ patient subset in the second half of 2023.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To date, a total of 15 frank relapse patients have been treated. In addition to the 11 patients previously reported, who were treated with MT-401 manufactured using the original manufacturing process, four additional patients have been treated with MT-401 manufactured using the improved manufacturing process.

● | Of the four patients treated with the improved manufacturing process, one of these patients received a dose of 100 x 106 cells per infusion, while the other three patients were dosed at 200 x 106 cells per infusion.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | None of the frank relapse patients showed an objective response to therapy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have suspended further enrollment of frank relapse patients while re-evaluating additional modifications for this patient cohort, including potentially higher cell doses.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In September 2022, we announced that we had been awarded a $2.0 million grant from the FDA’s Orphan Products Grant program to support the Company’s Phase 2 clinical trial of MT-401 for the treatment of minimal residual disease in post-transplant AML after allogeneic stem cell transplant.
Off-the-shelf MT-401 (MT-401-OTS) for the Treatment of AML
We intend to expand our AML program with the development of MT-401-OTS, a scalable, off-the-shelf product candidate with the potential to provide treatment to patients in under three days. We intend to dose patients using “banked” products based on human leukocyte antigen matching. We believe our off-the-shelf platform has high scalability, where one donor has the potential to provide more than 100 patient products. Our open IND for MT-401 for the treatment of AML includes clearance of the protocol that will test the safety and efficacy of the off the shelf product in patients with AML/MDS who cannot access their HSCT donor. We are in the process of developing our patient cell bank inventory and expect to dose the first patient in 2023. We expect to expand our off-the-shelf platform into clinical trials for other hematological malignancies and solid tumors.
MT-601 for the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer
We reported interim data for an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial (TACTOPS) of the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy targeting five TAAs for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma being conducted by BCM. In this trial, we have observed a clinical benefit with 4 of 13 patients (31%) showing objective responses in front-line unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer which correlated with the post-infusion detection of tumor-reactive T cells in patient peripheral blood and within tumor biopsy samples in patients in the tumor-resection arm of the trial. These T cells exhibited activity against both targeted antigens and non-targeted TAAs, indicating induction of antigen spreading. To date, we have not observed any cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity in this trial.
We recently began developing multiTAA-specific T cells in pancreatic cancer with product manufactured with two additional antigens when compared to MT-401, to which we refer as MT-601, starting at a similar dose level used in the TACTOPS study. MT-601 is a multiTAA-specific T cell product targeting six tumor-associated antigens which are highly expressed in pancreatic cancer. In January 2022, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to MT-601 for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer. The FDA cleared the Company’s IND application for MT-601 in November 2022 to initiate the PANACEA study, a Phase 1 multicenter clinical trial in locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer to assess the safety and efficacy of MT-601 in combination with front-line chemotherapy. We expect to initiate the PANACEA study by the fourth quarter of 2023 and to enroll a total of approximately 40 patients. The PANACEA trial will include a dose escalation portion followed by a dose expansion portion, with a dose of 200 - 400 million cells every four weeks for up to six doses.

MT-601 for the Treatment of Lymphoma
We are also pursuing the development of MT-601 for the treatment of lymphoma. In August 2022, the FDA cleared the Company’s IND application for MT-601 for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma who have failed or are ineligible to receive anti-CD19 CAR T cell treatment. The Phase 1 clinical trial, named APOLLO study, was initiated in the first quarter of 2023, and we anticipate reporting a clinical readout in the first quarter of 2024.
Additional Clinical Development of multiTAA-Specific T Cell Therapies
We are also evaluating the multiTAA-specific T cell therapies in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of breast cancer and in Phase 1 clinical trials for the treatment of ALL, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or MM, and sarcoma, all of which are being conducted by BCM. As of June 2021, the multiTAA-specific T cell therapies were generally well tolerated by all of the patients enrolled in clinical trials in hematological and solid tumor indications with no incidents of cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity, which are frequently associated with CAR-T therapies. Our ongoing clinical trials may be also affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of any new variant strains of COVID-19. Based on our observations in clinical trials in AML, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, ALL and MM, we believe that the multiTAA-specific T cell therapies have the potential to mediate a meaningful anti-tumor effect, as well as significant in vivo expansion of T cells.

Pipeline
Our clinical-stage pipeline, including clinical trials being conducted by BCM and other partners, is set forth below:

​
Our Strategy
Our multiTAA-specific T cells are designed to enhance the capacity of non-engineered T cells to find and kill cancer by increasing the diversity and quantity of naturally occurring cancer killing T cells within the patient.
Our goal is to be the leader in the development and commercialization of transformative immunotherapies for the treatment of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. We are developing a portfolio of highly differentiated T cell therapies utilizing the

multiTAA-specific T cell platform that we believe has the potential to significantly disrupt the current cell therapy landscape, while substantially improving survival and quality of life for patients with cancers.
The key elements of our strategy include:
·     Expedite clinical development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of our lead product candidates.
Based on the results of the Phase 1 clinical trials of the multiTAA-specific T cell therapies conducted at BCM, we plan to advance our lead product candidates into Phase 2 clinical trials and facilitate the initiation of company-sponsored clinical trials. We are pursuing post-transplant AML as the lead indication for the multiTAA-specific T cell program. We completed the safety lead-in portion of our Phase 2 trial of MT-401 in post-transplant AML in June 2021 and initiated the remainder of the Phase 2 trial in July 2021. We initiated a Phase 1 trial of MT-601 in non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the first quarter of 2023.
We plan to initiate future additional clinical trials in other tumor types based on emerging data. Our current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas is fully operational to support our clinical manufacturing. Before our new facility was operational, clinical product manufacturing was conducted at BCM’s GMP cell manufacturing facility.
·     Continue to collaborate with our partners and increase our internal research and development activities to improve and develop adoptive cell therapy technologies.
We are party to a strategic alliance with BCM, pursuant to which we will sponsor selected research at BCM in support of our technology. In conjunction with this strategic alliance, BCM will conduct selected Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of our product candidates. If data from these early clinical trials are positive, we will consider the therapeutic and commercial potential for such therapies to be advanced as new product candidates for us.
In addition, we plan to use our company laboratories to enable the process development required to support the Phase 2 clinical trials of our product candidates. We have invested, and plan to continue to invest in our own research and development and chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, capabilities to enhance our ability to conduct process development to optimize our manufacturing process, product quality and commercial scalability. For instance, we optimized the multiTAA-specific T cell manufacturing process by closing the system and reducing the total manufacturing time from the original 36 days (BCM) to nine days. The improved manufacturing process has been implemented to supply all of the clinical products used in our current company-sponsored Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. The improved manufacturing process enables products with increased antigen specificity and diversity, both of which have a strong linear correlation to anti-tumor activity and four-fold increase in potency in vitro.
·     Invest in our platform to maximize the beneficial outcomes for cancer patients.
We plan to explore new product opportunities by increasing and/or customizing the antigens we target to expand the indications in which the multiTAA-specific T cell products will be efficacious, including solid tumors or other hematologic malignancies. Additionally, our research and development efforts may include the exploration of different doses and/or frequency of dosing and the relationship of these factors with potential therapeutic benefit.
·     Leverage our relationships with our founding institutions, scientific founders and other scientific advisors.
Our world-renowned scientific founders and scientific advisors have made seminal contributions to major discoveries in the field of immuno-oncology, and have significant experience in oncology, immunology and cell therapy. We intend to significantly leverage the knowledge, experience and advice of our scientific founders and advisors, as well as the institutional expertise of BCM and our other major institutional partners, to advance our therapies through the clinic and into commercialization.

Background and History of Cancer Immunotherapies
Despite advances in options for treatment, cancer continues to be one of the main causes of death in developed countries. Historically, cancer therapy has been constrained to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. More recently, advances in the understanding of the immune system’s role in cancer surveillance have led to immunotherapy becoming an important treatment approach. Cancer immunotherapy began with treatments that nonspecifically activated the immune system and had limited efficacy and/or significant toxicity. In contrast, newer immunotherapy treatments activate specific, potent immune cells, leading to improved safety and efficacy. Within the immunotherapy category, treatments have included vaccines, cytokine therapies, antibody therapies, and adoptive cell therapies.
In 1996, Dr. Dana Leach, Dr. Matthew Krummel and Dr. James Allison reported that monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, blocking CTLA-4 could treat tumors in animal models. Subsequently, mAbs that targeted CTLA-4 and PD-1 became known as immune checkpoint inhibitors, or ICIs. Immune checkpoints are a means by which cancer cells inhibit or turn down the body’s immune response to cancer. By interfering with these cloaking mechanisms, ICIs have shown an ability to activate T cells, shrink tumors, and improve patient survival. Recent clinical data from checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab have confirmed both the validity of this approach and the importance of T cells as promising tools for the treatment of cancer.
Despite these many advances, there persists a significant unmet need in cancer therapeutics. We believe that the use of human cells as a therapeutic modality to re-engage the immune system will be the next significant advancement in the treatment of cancer. These cellular therapies may avoid the long-term side effects associated with current treatments and have the potential to be effective regardless of the type of previous treatments patients have experienced.
T Cell Therapy Overview
The field of adoptive cell transfer is currently comprised primarily of CAR and TCR engineered T cells and has emerged from principles of basic immunology to become a paradigm-shifting clinical immunotherapy. T cell therapy has evolved as one of the most promising branches of immunotherapy. T cell immunotherapy involves the infusion of T cells into a patient. Immune cells used for immunotherapy treatments can either be collected from the patient (autologous) or harvested from a donor (allogeneic). The cells are retrieved and either genetically modified to express tumor-specific CARs or TCRs or stimulated with specific antigens. The cells are then cultured to proliferate, and the proliferated cells are infused into the patient. Upon infusion, the cells can target and eliminate cancerous cells. Unlike chemotherapy, which is unable to distinguish between healthy and malignant cells, T cells produced for immunotherapy can selectively attack cancer cells that express the target antigen(s). This leads to a more effective treatment platform with fewer side effects. Some of these infused T cells may remain in the body for long periods, providing immunological memory, thus leading to longer and more durable responses.
TCRs and CARs have distinct signaling properties and antigen sensitivities. TCRs recognize peptide fragments from proteins expressed either inside the cell or on the cell surface, which are presented to T cells via major histocompatibility complex molecules. CARs are programmed to recognize a specific cell surface protein. Because CARs are specific for a single antigen, or more precisely a single epitope within the single antigen, they are very narrowly focused and have limitations. When a CAR-T cell product is applied to a specific antigen of a heterogeneous disease, CAR-T cells may leave behind tumor cells that do not express the target antigen, which can lead to tumor relapse due to immune escape.
Our approach is to avoid genetic engineering by relying upon the native T cell receptor, which has evolved over millions of years to provide T cells with an exquisite capacity to recognize and kill cancer cells. Use of the native T cell receptor is the bedrock of our versatile immunotherapy, which is intended to provide a cost-effective and non-toxic strategy to target multiple tumor antigens and lead to durable responses. The process entails expanding tumor-specific T cells from patients (autologous), or a patient’s hematopoietic stem cell donor (allogeneic). This is achieved by in vitro manipulation consisting of co-culturing a patient’s or donor’s antigen presenting cells with patient (or donor) peripheral blood mononuclear cells, or PBMCs, respectively. As a source of antigen, we use overlapping peptide libraries spanning each of several immunogenic target antigens that are typically associated with certain types of cancer. These peptides are at least 15 amino acids in length, overlapping by approximately 11 amino acids and span the entire length of each of the target antigens. This typical footprint of peptides allows us to induce both CD4+ (helper) and CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells. Following manufacture, these cells are frozen and stored for later infusion. Once infused, the natural characteristics of T cells take over and the T cells multiply in quantity, forming an army of T cells that kill the targeted cancer cells.

7



We have observed evidence of “epitope spreading” in our clinical trials, suggesting that the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy is inducing an enhanced response by the patient’s own T cells (specific for an expanded set of tumor-associated antigens beyond those targeted by the infused product). Correlative analyses show expansion of endogenous T cells, other than those present in the infused product, in the months following infusion. This phenomenon, also known as “antigen spreading,” is potentially important in generating a deep and durable response for a patient because it enables the killing of tumors that do not express any of the antigens initially targeted by our therapy and could be due to the lack of lymphodepletion that allows recruitment of the endogenous immune system for anti-tumor activity.
The MultiTAA-Specific T Cell Therapies
In collaboration with BCM, we are advancing three multiTAA-specific T cell therapies through clinical development:

· | Autologous multiTAA-specific T cell therapies target the NY-ESO-1, PRAME, MAGE-A4, Survivin and SSX2 antigens. We recently reported updated clinical data from BCM’s Phase 1/2 clinical trial of the autologous multiTAA therapy for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer, and we are currently evaluating these therapies for the treatment of patients with lymphoma, pancreatic and other selected solid tumors in Phase 1 trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Allogeneic multiTAA-specific T cell therapies target the WT1, NY-ESO-1, PRAME, and Survivin antigens. The stem cell transplant donor is used as the source of the cells manufactured for our allogeneic therapies. We are pursuing post-transplant AML as the lead indication for the multiTAA-specific T cell program using our allogeneic therapies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Off-the-shelf multiTAA-specific T cell therapies - We plan to enroll patients that will be matched to the pre-manufactured inventory of MT-401-OTS products based on their human leukocyte antigen, or HLA. Because the MT-401-OTS product inventory is pre-manufactured, the T cell product is delivered to the patient in a significantly shorter amount of time than a patient-specific T cell product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the blood source and the antigens for stimulation differ between the autologous, allogeneic and off-the-shelf therapies, the manufacturing process for each product is identical.
Cancers are heterogeneous in their expression of antigens. Tumors generally consist of individual cancer cells expressing different antigens, and each of those antigens can be present at a different level that can change over time. Therapies targeting only a single antigen are vulnerable to evolutionary escape mechanisms.
​
​
While single-antigen specific therapy can eliminate all the tumor cells expressing the targeted antigen, the residual tumor cells that do not express that antigen may survive and expand. In addition, tumor cells may also downregulate or mutate the targeted antigen, thus becoming invisible to the T cell therapy. Both phenomena create a transformed tumor that is impervious to that therapy. This process is referred to as antigen-negative tumor escape.

8



Our solution to the problem of tumor heterogeneity is the development of T cell products that simultaneously attack multiple tumor-expressed antigens and thereby enable more complete initial tumor targeting, thus minimizing the subsequent opportunity for the cancer to engage escape mechanisms. Of note, data suggest that this strategy may be responsible for recruitment and activation of unique cancer-killing cells from the patient’s own immune repertoire to participate in cancer eradication, further minimizing the possibility for tumor cell escape.
​
​
We believe our proprietary multiTAA-specific T cell platform may have meaningful advantages over current CAR and TCR-engineered cell therapy approaches. Compared to current gene-modified T cell therapies, the multiTAA-specific T cell product candidates are characterized by the following:
·    Clinical benefits observed in early-stage clinical trials in multiple cancer indications.
Based on our observations in clinical trials in AML, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, ALL and MM, we believe that the multiTAA-specific T cell therapies have the potential to mediate a meaningful anti-tumor effect, as well as significant in vivo expansion of T cells. For example, in BCM’s Phase 1 clinical trial in lymphoma, there were complete responses, or CRs, in six of the fifteen evaluable patients with active disease. Significantly, no patient with a CR has subsequently relapsed with disease, whereas typically 30% or more of patients with CR in reported CAR-T studies relapse within one year. In patient results to date in this trial, observed therapeutic responses appear to be highly durable, with some patients being relapse-free beyond five years.
·    Non-gene modified.
Unlike CAR and TCR-based approaches, the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy does not require genetic modification of T cells, a costly and complex process that significantly complicates the manufacturing of a patient product. We believe our multiTAA-specific T cell therapy can be manufactured at a fraction of the cost of a gene-modified T cell product, with substantially reduced complexity of manufacturing.
·    No need for lymphodepletion before infusion.
Unlike CAR-T therapies, which require lymphodepletion of a patient’s existing T cells so that they will not compete with the infused therapy, the multiTAA-specific T cell therapies work with the natural capabilities of T cells to target cancer and do not require lymphodepletion prior to infusion.

9



·    Low incidence rate of adverse events.
As of January 2022, the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy was generally well tolerated by all of the patients enrolled in clinical trials in hematological and solid tumor indications with no incidences of cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity. This appears to compare favorably with published CD19 CAR-T studies that have been associated with substantial tolerability concerns, including one Phase 1 trial in which 95% of patients had Grade 3 or higher adverse events during treatment.
·    Appears to drive endogenous immune responses.
In our clinical trials, we have observed evidence of “epitope spreading” in the treated patients, meaning that the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy is potentially inducing an enhanced response by the patient’s own T cells (specific for an expanded set of tumor-associated antigens beyond those targeted by the infused product). Correlative analyses show expansion of endogenous T cells, other than those present in the infused product, in the months following infusion. This phenomenon, also known as “antigen spreading,” is potentially important in generating a deep and durable response for a patient, because it enables the killing of tumors that do not express any of the antigens initially targeted by our therapy and could be due to the lack of lymphodepletion that allows recruitment of the endogenous immune system for anti-tumor activity.
·    Capable of addressing a broad repertoire of cancer cells.
While CAR-T and TCR therapies generally target a single epitope, our manufacturing process selects for T cells that are specific for multiple peptides derived from several targeted antigens. Deep gene sequencing of our products shows that a typical patient dose usually consists of approximately 4,000 unique T cell clonotypes, some of which target up to five different tumor-associated antigens. The five antigen targets can be recognized by a very wide range of T cells, which we believe facilitates robust killing of targeted cancer cells.
Clinical Development of Our multiTAA-Specific T Cell Therapies by BCM
The following clinical trials are being conducted by BCM pursuant to our strategic alliance. If data from these early clinical trials are positive, we will consider the therapeutic and commercial potential for such therapies to be advanced as new product candidates for us. In each trial, correlative studies showed significant expansion of multiTAA-specific T cells, as well as significant evidence of epitope spreading with expansion of endogenous T cells specific for tumor-associated antigens that were not targeted by the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia
We are pursuing the development of MT-401 for the treatment of post-transplant AML as the lead indication for the multiTAA-specific T cell program. Currently, available treatments for post-transplant AML patients are limited and include donor lymphocyte infusion, which has an approximately 15% overall response rate but a 30% to 50% risk of severe and debilitating graft-versus-host disease. The five-year mortality rate for patients who receive an allogeneic HSCT exceeds 50%, and patients who relapse after a transplant have a survival expectation of approximately 4.5 months.

10



BCM recently completed a Phase 1 AML/MDS clinical trial of the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy for the treatment of patients with post-transplant AML. In this trial, we treated patients in remission and with active disease post-transplant. As reported in a 2021 publication by Lulla et al. and illustrated below, 11 of the 17 patients in the adjuvant disease setting dosed with the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy after receiving an allogeneic HSCT never relapsed [median LFS not reached at a median follow-up of 1.9 years], with 11 of 15 patients (two patients were each treated during two different remissions) remaining alive (estimated two-year overall survival of 77%) at a median follow-up of 1.9 years post-infusion which compares favorably with HSCT outcomes for risk-matched AML/MDS patients post-HSCT [median LFS of nine to 15 months and two-year survival probability of 42%].

Additionally, eight patients were treated for active disease that was resistant to salvage therapy post-HSCT with a median of five prior lines of therapy (range: four to ten). One of the eight patients crossed over from the adjuvant group while two patients enrolled twice, but all three patients had active AML that failed another line of salvage therapy after their first multiTAA-specific T cell infusion. As shown below, two of the eight patients achieved objective responses with one complete response and one partial response, with six patients continuing with stable disease.
​
​
In this trial, the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy was well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events and no instances of greater than Grade 2 graft-versus-host disease. The maximum grade treatment-related adverse event was seen in one patient in the adjuvant disease group who had a possibly drug-related Grade 3 elevation of liver enzymes but was treated with prednisone with complete resolution. After discontinuing treatment and receiving decitabine, the patient relapsed and later re-enrolled in the trial in the active disease group and entered CR for 13 months and survived for 2.5 years.
Pancreatic Cancer
We are developing MT-601 for the treatment of advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. In May 2020, we reported interim data from an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma being conducted by BCM. In this trial, BCM plans to enroll approximately 45 patients with advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma in three arms: Arm A, which includes patients with unresectable/metastatic disease who are responding to standard first-line chemotherapy; Arm B, which includes patients with progressive disease or therapy intolerance; and Arm C, which includes patients with surgically resectable disease. A total of 31 patients were administered the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy: 13 patients in Arm A, 10 patients in Arm B and eight patients in Arm C.
Overall, we have observed a clinical benefit correlated with the detection of tumor-reactive T cells in patient peripheral blood (Arms A, B and C) and within tumor biopsy samples (Arm C) post-infusion. T cells exhibited activity against both targeted antigens as well as non-targeted TAAs, including MAGE-A2B and AFP, indicating induction of antigen/epitope spreading. No cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity has been observed in any arm of the trial to date.

12



Arm A
Arm A is designed to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of using multiTAA-specific T cell therapy as part of first-line treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer. These patients in the chemo-responsive arm have completed or will complete at least three months of standard-of-care chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX), which is the period during which a response to chemotherapy would typically occur, before receiving up to six administrations of multiTAA-specific T cell therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy. 
For 12 of the 13 patients, sufficient cells for all six planned doses were generated; two doses were available for the remaining patient.

● | Out of the 13 evaluable patients (best overall response):
--+----------------------------------------------------------


o | four patients experienced objective responses after administration of multiTAA cells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | one patient experienced a radiographic complete response occurring at month nine after starting chemotherapy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | three patients experienced partial responses per RECIST occurring at six-nine months after starting chemotherapy;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | six patients experienced stable disease;
--+-----------------------------------------


o | one patient experienced a mixed response (some lesions increased in size and others decreased for a net zero change in size of tumor lesions);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients had durable cancer control with nine of the 13 patients exceeding historical control of overall survival;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Five patients enrolled in the study were not administered multiTAA-specific T cells, either because of disease progression (four patients) which made them ineligible for treatment, or because insufficient starting material from the patient was available for manufacturing (one patient);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Evidence of epitope-spreading was observed in all responders, suggesting that the multiTAA T cell therapy triggered the recruitment of a broader endogenous immune system response for improved anti-tumor activity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No infusion-related reactions, cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity was observed.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In patients responding to therapy, significant expansion of the infused multiTAA-specific T cell therapy was observed, along with broad-based epitope spreading, with significant expansion of endogenous T cells specific for other tumor specific antigens.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In patients responding to therapy, significant expansion of the infused multiTAA-specific T cell therapy was observed, along with broad-based epitope spreading, with significant expansion of endogenous T cells specific for other tumor specific antigens.

13



Arm B
Arm B is designed to evaluate the use of multiTAA-specific T cell therapy as a second-line therapy for patients who have failed first-line chemotherapy. The patients in this chemo-refractory arm are either ineligible for chemotherapy or have progressed on chemotherapy and have received or are receiving up to six doses of multiTAA-specific T cell therapy as a monotherapy. The following graphic depicts the best clinical assessment of the 10 evaluable patients in Arm B:

Among the patients who saw clinical disease stabilization, significant expansion of the infused multiTAA-specific T cell therapy was observed, along with broad-based epitope spreading, with significant expansion of endogenous T cells specific for other tumor-specific antigens.

14



Arm C
Arm C is designed to assess T cell infiltration and expansion. These patients with borderline surgically resectable disease received or will receive a dose of multiTAA-specific T cell therapy following chemotherapy, radiotherapy or combination and prior to surgical resection and up to five additional doses of T cells after surgery. In the patients evaluable in Arm C, multiTAA-specific T cells were measurable in meaningful numbers as detected by correlative analysis of resected tumor, and significant expansion of the infused multiTAA-specific T cells was observed, along with broad-based epitope spreading, with significant expansion of endogenous T cells specific for other tumor specific antigens. As illustrated below with respect to the six patients treated in Arm C, three of the patients in Arm C remain in the trial, while three patients had recurrence of disease:
​
Lymphoma
BCM is currently evaluating the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with lymphoma. A total of 32 patients received two protocol-specified infusions of multiTAA-specific T cells, 14 with Hodgkin lymphoma, or HL, and 18 with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL, [diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, (n=12), mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, (n=2), T-cell lymphoma (n=3) and composite lymphoma (HL and DLBCL, n=1)].

15



As reported in a recent publication by Vasileiou et al., BCM had treated 15 patients with active disease, which we refer to as the active lymphoma group, all of whom had completed a follow-up period beyond three months post-infusion. These patients were heavily pre-treated and, on average, had failed a median of five prior lines of therapy (range four to eight) for the HL patients and a median of three prior lines of therapy (range three to four) for the NHL patients. As illustrated below, in the active lymphoma group, six patients entered CR and nine patients had experienced stable disease. None of the patients in CR had relapsed, and the range for the duration of CR in these patients were between two and over five years after being infused with the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy with the exception of one CR patient who died of an unrelated pneumonia. Responses in all six patients who entered CR were associated with an expansion of infused T cells, as well as induction of broad-based antigen spreading across many tumor-associated antigens.
​
​

16



We also treated 17 patients, including one patient who was treated a second time after a relapse, in remission, which we refer to as the adjuvant lymphoma group. Like the active lymphoma group, these patients were heavily pre-treated with seven patients with HL treated with a median of 4 prior lines of therapy (range three to five) and 10 patients with NHL with a median of three prior lines of therapy (range one to five). As illustrated below, in the adjuvant lymphoma group, all 17 patients had entered CR, with 14 patients in continued complete remission, or CCR, without relapsing. The duration of response ranged from approximately nine months to over five years.
​
​
In both treatment groups, the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy was well tolerated, with no drug-related serious adverse events, suggesting that the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy might serve as a standard-of-care maintenance therapy for lymphoma patients in remission.
Further, data from this trial show “epitope spreading,” or expansion of patients’ endogenous T cells (specific for an expanded set of tumor-associated antigens beyond those targeted by the infused therapy) in the months following infusion. Significantly, we have observed this effect even though some patients in this trial received doses that had not yet been antigen-escalated to the full antigen dose.
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
BCM is currently evaluating the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with ALL. Leukemic relapse is one of the primary causes of treatment failure in HSCT recipients. Like post-transplant AML patients, post-transplant ALL patients have limited treatment options, with donor lymphocyte infusions similarly associated with the risk of life-threatening graft-versus-host disease. While CAR-T therapies have shown potent anti-leukemia activity in post-transplant ALL patients, CD19-CAR-T cell therapies target a single antigen, carrying the inherent risk of immune escape, and are most effective in malignancies of B-cell lineage. In contrast, the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy targets multiple antigens expressed in both B- and T-cell ALL.
In this trial, as reported in February 2019 we had treated 18 patients. Of the seven evaluable patients:

● | All evaluable patients were up to 28 months in CCR;
--+----------------------------------------------------

17




● | One patient experienced relapse displayed mixed donor/recipient chimerism after transplant, but remained in CCR for 6 months; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patients who remained in CCR had been durable for between four to 28 months, with a median of 16 months.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple Myeloma
BCM is currently evaluating the multiTAA-specific T cell therapy in a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with MM. In this trial, we are treating both active and adjuvant post-autologous stem cell transplant MM patients both within 90 days and more than 90 days post-transplant. We have not seen a meaningful difference in response rates or durability between the two arms and intend to standardize future trials based upon a protocol wherein patients will receive multiTAA-specific T cell therapy immediately post-transplant.
As reported in a 2021 publication by Lulla et al., of the 12 patients that had been treated in the active MM group with a median of 3.5 prior lines:

● | One patient had a CR;
--+----------------------


● | Two patients achieved partial responses; and
--+---------------------------------------------


● | Nine patients had stable disease following initial multiTAA-specific T cell infusion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of the nine patients that had been treated in the adjuvant MM group, all nine patients had remained in CCR, with a median follow-up of 21 months. Only two patients had relapsed at months seven and 13 after infusion while the remaining patients remain in CCR at a median follow-up of 27.5 months.
Process Development and Manufacturing of The MultiTAA-Specific T Cell Therapies
In the manufacturing process, blood is drawn from either the individual patient (in the case of the autologous T cells) or from the allogeneic stem cell transplant donor (in the case of the allogeneic T cells). Although the T cells that are selected and expanded by our process exist in a patient’s circulating blood, these T cells are often present at very low frequencies. Researchers at BCM believe that these T cells are adversely affected by the suppressive tumor microenvironment. It is a well-accepted concept that cancers not only evade immune detection but often actively suppress the function of the human immune system. Our manufacturing and culturing process is intended to (1) identify the T cells specific for the antigens that we intend to target, (2) restore these T cells to functionality with respect to their anti-tumor capability and (3) expand the population of those T cells specific for our targets to achieve the required patient dose.
After blood is drawn, PBMCs are isolated and used to manufacture a patient-specific product. These cells are placed inside a G-Rex manufacturing device and combined with an experimentally optimized mix of GMP-grade cytokines that is used to restore and enhance the functional capability of the cultured T cells. In addition, libraries of overlapping peptides, which we refer to as peptide pools, spanning the target antigens are combined with antigen presenting cells and added to the cell culture. Each peptide within a peptide pool represents a small segment of a target antigen, which a T cell might recognize. Each library represents the entire protein sequence of a target antigen, with each peptide overlapping significantly with the peptides adjacent to it within the antigen’s protein sequence. This overlapping structure allows us to isolate, activate and expand any T cell that is specific for any segment of the antigens that we target in the unique genetic background of every patient.

18



The G-Rex is a cell culture device manufactured by Wilson Wolf Manufacturing Corporation, or Wilson Wolf, used by many cell therapy developers, both in commercial and academic settings. The device allows a user to introduce cells, medium and other reagents into a cell culture chamber, which has a gas-permeable membrane at its bottom. The cells settle on this gas-permeable membrane through which oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged (i.e. the cells can breathe at the base of the device), while nutrients required for cell expansion are obtained from the medium above the cells. This system allows for the highly robust growth of cells in culture, by providing them with superior access to oxygen and nutrients. Cells manufactured in the device grow efficiently without need for agitation by a technician, scientist or automated system.
Inside the G-Rex, PBMCs are co-cultured with antigen-presenting cells that have been exposed to the stimulating peptide pools. This results in the selective expansion of T cells that specifically recognize the target antigens. At the end of the manufacturing process, the resulting product is a mix of helper (CD4+) and cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells that recognize the targeted antigens.
Once cell manufacturing is complete, the product is tested for identity, sterility, phenotype and functionality before it is released for infusion into a patient. Sampling of product indicates that, on average, approximately 4,000 different T cell clonotypes are present in a typical 5-antigen-specific patient product.
Upon release of the final patient product, the cells are frozen and transported to the site where the cells will be administered. The standard dose for patients with lymphoma, AML or myeloma ranges from five to 20 million cells per meter squared (corresponding to typical doses of 10 to 40 million cells per adult patient). These cell doses represent a significantly smaller dose of cells, when compared to CAR-T or TCR therapies. As a result, our therapy requires only a very small infusion volume that can be administered to patients within minutes at an outpatient center. Due to the low incidence of adverse events with our therapies, patients do not need to be hospitalized and monitored overnight. Instead, the patients are evaluated for any immediate infusion-related reactions and can then usually be discharged within two hours.
We have established an in-house cGMP manufacturing facility, and we began manufacturing MT-401 for our Phase 2 trial in AML in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our facility allows for production of multiTAA-specific T cell products according to FDA guidelines and is designed to be scalable using modular processes. We believe that our in-house manufacturing facility confers key advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, in particular that we are less reliant on contract manufacturing organizations, which are expensive and often have long lead times, shortages of skilled labor and a backlog of customers.
Manufacturing
We completed the construction and qualification of our cGMP manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas in January 2021, and we began manufacturing MT-401 for our Phase 2 trial in AML in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our facility allows for production of multiTAA-specific T cell products according to FDA guidelines and is designed to be scalable using modular processes. Prior to that time, we relied on BCM to manufacture our multiTAA-specific T cell therapies, and we continue to rely on BCM to manufacture the raw materials, our active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, and finished solid dose products for our peptide vaccines for clinical uses. We anticipate using our manufacturing facility to produce clinical supply of MT-601 and commercial supply of any approved product candidates.
Our supply chain for manufacturing raw materials, API, peptide vaccines and multiTAA-specific T cell therapies ready for distribution and commercialization is a multi-step process. Establishing and managing the supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships.

19



Competition
Our drug discovery, development and ultimate commercialization activities face, and will continue to face, intense competition from organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. We face significant competition from organizations, particularly fully integrated pharmaceutical companies that are pursuing pharmaceuticals which are competitive with our drug candidates. Our product candidates may compete with product candidates from a number of companies, which are developing various types of similar in vivo T-cell immunotherapies and therapeutic cancer vaccines to treat cancer, including: Advaxis Inc., Bavarian Nordic, BN Immunotherapeutics, Celldex, Immunocellular, Merck/Immune Design, SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc. (formerly) Galena BioPharma, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology (formerly) Antigen Express and Transgene S.A. In addition, other adoptive T-cell therapies, monoclonal antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors also provide competition in the oncology space. In these areas, competitors include Adaptimmune, AstraZeneca plc, Bluebird Bio, Cellectis, Immatics, Iovance, Juno Therapeutics/Celgene/Bristol Myers Squibb, Kite Pharma/Gilead, Kuur Therapeutics, Medimmune, LLC, Merck & Co, NexImmune, Novartis, Repertoire Immune Medicines, Roche Pharmaceuticals and Tessa Therapeutics. We believe that our non-engineered T cells therapy and our in vivo T-cell therapy approaches will be synergistic and may improve therapies being developed by these competitors. Many companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources, and significantly greater experience than we do in the following:

● | drug discovery;
--+----------------


● | developing products;
--+---------------------


● | undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA and other regulatory approval or commercializing products that compete with our drug candidates.
In addition, any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use. Competition may also arise from:

● | other drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | new small molecules; or
--+------------------------


● | other classes of therapeutic agents.
--+-------------------------------------

We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to drug candidates or proprietary technology. These competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing products that are more effective than ours.
Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:

● | develop proprietary products;
--+------------------------------


● | develop and maintain products that reach the market first, are technologically superior to and/or are of lower cost than other products in the market;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | attract and retain scientific, product development and sales and marketing personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20




● | obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtain required regulatory approvals; and
--+------------------------------------------


● | manufacture, market, distribute and sell any products that we develop.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In a number of countries, including in particular, developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs available at a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major pharmaceutical companies have greatly reduced prices for their drugs in certain developing countries. If certain countries do not permit enforcement of any of our patents, sales of our products in those countries, and in other countries could be reduced by generic competition or by parallel importation of our product. Alternatively, governments in those countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products in those countries, thereby reducing our product sales, or we could respond to governmental concerns by reducing prices for our products. In all these situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
BCM Exclusive License Agreement
On March 16, 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the BCM License Agreement, with BCM, under which we received a worldwide, exclusive license to BCM’s rights in and to certain intellectual property rights, including European patent EP 2470644 (estimated expiration date August 24, 2030), to develop and commercialize multiTAA-specific T cell product candidates.
Exclusive License to BCM’s Subject Technology:
1. “Generation of CTL Lines with Specificity Against Multiple Tumor Antigens or Multiple Viruses”
2. “Pepmixes to Generate Multiviral CTLs with Broad Specificity”
3. “Immunogenic Antigen Identification from a Pathogen and Correlation to Clinical Efficacy”
4. “T cell performance assay as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome”
In partial consideration for the exclusive rights granted under the BCM License Agreement, Marker Cell Therapy, Inc., an entity that is now our wholly owned subsidiary, issued shares of its common stock to BCM valued at approximately $5.0 million at the time of issuance. Such initial equity issuance was exchanged into merger consideration of 149,081 shares of our common stock and warrants to acquire 54,064 shares of our common stock in connection with the merger we completed in October 2018, each as adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split that we effected in January 2023. Additional consideration includes a royalty paid on net sales by us to BCM according to the royalty schedule in the BCM License Agreement. The royalty fee schedule is based on aggregate net sales in four different ranges: (1) less than $500 million, (2) $500 million to $1.0 billion, (3) $1.0 billion and over, and (4) $2.0 billion and over. The corresponding royalty percentages range from 0.65% to 5.0% - increasing in proportion to the aggregate net sales. The royalty fee may be reduced in the event that we must pay additional royalties with respect to third-party owned patent rights or technology necessary for the use, manufacture or sale of a licensed product. We also agreed to pay BCM up to an aggregate of $64.85 million in milestone payments upon the occurrence of nine particular milestones relating to completion of the first dosing in clinical trials for a first and second distinct product, receipt of approval from the FDA and the achievement of certain net sales goals. We are also responsible for sublicensing fees. In addition, under the BCM License Agreement, we are responsible for reimbursing BCM for patent-related expenses. BCM is responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining all patent applications and patents included in the licensed patent rights, and we have agreed to reimburse BCM for all such related legal costs incurred after the date of the BCM License Agreement, except such legal costs shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis on a patent or patent application basis should BCM license such patent or patent application in additional fields of use to any third party.
In addition, upon a liquidity event (as defined in the BCM License Agreement) of the Company, BCM will receive a liquidity incentive payment of 0.5% of the liquidity event proceeds (as defined in the BCM License Agreement).

21



We have agreed to indemnify BCM and certain persons affiliated with BCM against claims and liabilities directly or indirectly related to or arising out of the design, process, manufacture or use by any third party of the licensed products, even though such claims and liabilities result in whole or in part from the negligence of the BCM indemnified parties or are based upon doctrines of strict liability or product liability, but not claims or liabilities arising from the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of any such BCM indemnified parties.
Unless terminated sooner, the license will expire on a licensed product-by-product basis and country-by-country basis, on the later of (1) the date of expiration of the last valid claim of patent rights to expire that covers the sale of such licensed product in such country, or (2) the first date following the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of first licensed product by us in such country. After such expiration, but not termination, the licenses granted to us shall survive and become a perpetual, paid-in-full license in such country with respect to such licensed product.
We have the right in our sole discretion to terminate the BCM License Agreement upon 60 days’ written notice to BCM. BCM has the right to terminate the agreement upon material default or failure of us of our overall obligation to perform any of the terms, covenants or provisions of the license agreement, including failure to make timely payment, taken as a whole, and which default or failure remains uncured thirty days after written notice from BCM of such material default or failure to correct such default or failure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a material default or failure is not susceptible to cure within the 30-day cure period, BCM’s right to terminate shall be suspended if, and for so long as, (1) we have provided BCM with a written plan that is reasonably calculated to effect a cure, (2) such plan is reasonably acceptable to BCM, in its sole but reasonable discretion, and (3) we commit to and do carry out such plan; provided, however, that, unless mutually agreed to by the parties in such plan, such suspension of BCM’s right to terminate shall not extend beyond 60 days after the original cure period. In addition, either party’s right to terminate the license agreement shall be tolled for so long as dispute resolution procedures are being pursued by the allegedly breaching party in good faith, and if it is finally and conclusively determined that the allegedly breaching party is in material breach, then the breaching party shall have the right to cure within 30 days after such determination. BCM also has the right to terminate the agreement if we shall (1) become involved in insolvency, dissolution, bankruptcy or receivership proceedings affecting the operation of our business, (2) make an assignment of all or substantially all of our assets for the benefit of creditors, or (3) if a receiver or trustee is appointed for us and we, after the expiration of 30 days following any of the enumerated events, are unable to secure a dismissal, stay or other suspension of such proceedings.
In the event of termination of the BCM License Agreement, but not expiration, all rights to the subject technology and patent rights thereunder shall revert to BCM, except to the extent necessary to exercise any surviving right or license thereunder. We may sell any licensed products actually in our possession at the effective date of termination, provided that we continue to pay to BCM royalties on all such sales in accordance with the license agreement, otherwise comply with the terms of the license agreement and sell all such licensed products within six months after the effective date of the termination.
In furtherance of the BCM License Agreement and as contemplated by the terms thereof, we entered into a Sponsored Research Agreement, or the SRA, with BCM, which provides for the conduct of research for us by credentialed personnel at BCM’s Center for Cell and Gene Therapy.
We have entered into additional agreements with BCM with respect to a strategic alliance to advance pre-clinical research, early-stage clinical trials, and Phase 2 clinical trials with respect to our product candidates, as well as continued access to our clinical data, and product manufacturing and support, including personnel and space at the institution for the foreseeable future.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, improvements, and know-how related to the business; to defend and enforce proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and other intellectual property; to obtain and maintain licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; and to operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities — for example, the rights obtained under exclusive license arrangements such as those pursuant to our BCM License Agreement. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing 

22



patents or any patents that may be granted in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
To achieve this objective, a strategic focus for us has been identifying and licensing key patents and patent applications that serve to enhance our intellectual property and technology position. Currently, all of our multiTAA-specific T cell intellectual property rights are licensed from BCM. Our intellectual property portfolio currently includes patent applications having: (1) claims directed to methods of generating multi-antigen specific T cell products; and (2) claims directed to therapeutic uses of such multi-antigen specific T cell products. We believe our patent portfolio, together with our efforts to develop and patent next-generation technologies, provides us with a substantial intellectual property position. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties.
Patents
Patents and other proprietary rights are vital to our business operations. We protect our technology through various United States and foreign patent filings and maintain trade secrets that we own. Our policy is to seek appropriate patent protection both in the United States and abroad for our proprietary technologies and product candidates. An enforceable patent with appropriate claim coverage can provide an advantage over competitors who may seek to employ similar approaches to develop therapeutics, and so the future commercial success of products, and therefore our future success, will be in part dependent on our intellectual property strategy. We reassess the value of each patent at the time maintenance fees are due, and in cases where maintaining the patent is judged to be of no significant strategic value, we decline to pay the maintenance fee.
There can be no assurance that our patents, and any patents that may be issued, assigned, or licensed to us in the future, will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, no assurances can be given that any patents issued, assigned, or licensed to us will not be infringed upon or designed around by others or that others will not obtain patents that we would need to license or design around. If existing or future patents held by third parties and containing broad claims over technology used by us were upheld by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction, the holders of such patents could require us to obtain licenses to use such technology. 
Patent coverage may also vary from country to country based on the scope of available patent protection. Moreover, in the United States, patent term may be adjusted to account for delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, during prosecution. There are also opportunities to obtain an extension of term for patents covering a product in certain jurisdictions, which adds further complexity to the determination of patent life.
We currently have a number of issued and pending patents covering composition of matter of our PolyStart technology and methods of using our PolyStart technology, including: U.S. 9,364,523 (estimated expiration date March 17, 2035); and U.S. 10,030,252 (estimated expiration date March 17, 2035); as well as pending U.S. patent applications.
The effect of the issued United States patents is that they provide us with patent protection for the claims covered by the patents. While the expiration of a product patent normally results in a loss of market exclusivity for the covered product or product candidate, commercial benefits may continue to be derived from , for example: (1) later- expiring patents on processes and intermediates related to improved methods of manufacture of the active ingredient of such product; (2) patents relating to the use of such product; (3) patents relating to novel compositions and formulations; and (4) in the United States and certain other countries, other types of market exclusivity that may be available under relevant law. The effect of patent expiration on our product candidates also depends upon many other factors such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in other countries.

23



Our pending patent applications cover a range of technologies, including specific embodiments and applications for treatment of various medical indications, improved application methods and adjunctive utilization with other therapeutic modalities. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Accordingly, we do not know whether any of the patent applications we own, will acquire, license, or will license will issue as patents, or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because unissued U.S. patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of eighteen months and U.S. patent applications filed prior to November 29, 2000 are not disclosed until such patents are issued, and since publication of discoveries/inventions in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discovery/invention, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications and whether potentially relevant earlier patent filings exist. Moreover, we may have to participate in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, or for United States patent applications filed before March 16, 2013, in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO, to determine priority of invention, or in United States inter partes review or post-grant review procedures, any of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that the patents, if issued, would be held valid by a court or other authority of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties, or require us to cease using such technology.
We have patents and patent applications in other countries, as well as in the European Patent Office, that we believe provide equivalent or comparable protection for our product candidates in jurisdictions internationally that we consider to be key markets. Patent applications related to our PolyStart technology are pending in Brazil and Canada. Because of differences in patent laws and laws concerning proprietary rights, the extent of protection provided by U.S. patents or proprietary rights owned by us may differ from that of their foreign counterparts.
Trade Secrets
We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of immuno-oncology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We also plan to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available, as well as contractual agreements with our academic and commercial partners.
We require each of our employees, consultants and advisors to execute a confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of any employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us. Each agreement provides that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship will be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our exclusive property.
Trademarks
We currently have pending with the USPTO applications for registration of the trademarks POLYSTART and “Marker Therapeutics.” We currently have the trademark “TapImmune” registered with the USPTO. We also have rights to use other names essential to our business. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life if they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. We regard our trademarks and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe they have significant value to us.
We believe that our patents, the protection of discoveries in connection with our development activities, our proprietary products, technologies, processes and know-how and all our intellectual property are important to our business. There can be no assurance that any of our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights will afford us any protection from competition.
Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various 

24



preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25



Preclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

● | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so- called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

26



BLA Submission and Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.

27



Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast-track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast-track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast-track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast-track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast-track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast-track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation is intended to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence such as electronic health records; through the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or through post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

28



Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

29




● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes which prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and which, as amended by Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, also imposes certain requirements on HIPAA covered entities and their business associates and covered subcontractors relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; the U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the federal government, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (as defined by the Physician Payments Sunshine Act), other covered physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by health care professionals and their immediate family members; and U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and certain states and local jurisdictions require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly. This process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each third-party payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Further, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which the Company receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.

31



In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. No regulatory authority has granted approval for a personalized cancer immunotherapy based on a vaccine approach, and there is no model for reimbursement of this type of product.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
In March 2010, the ACA was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contained a number of provisions of particular importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted, which, among other things, removed penalties for not complying with ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including, among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is also unclear how such challenges, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2%, which due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will stay in effect per fiscal year through 2031, except for a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 32, 2021 due to COVID-19 relief legislation, unless additional Congressional action is taken, and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Congress is also considering additional health reform measures as part of other reform initiatives. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump Administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020 providing pathways for states to build and submit importation

plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. However, it is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Product Liability and Insurance
We face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products. We have not experienced any product liability claims to date. We currently carry products and clinical trial liability insurance policies. There can be no assurance that liability claims will not exceed such insurance coverage limits, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

In addition, some consultants hold options to purchase our common stock, subject to the vesting requirements contained in separate award agreements. Our consultants may be employed by other entities and therefore may have commitments to their employer or may have other consulting or advisory agreements that may limit their availability to us.
