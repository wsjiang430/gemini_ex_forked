Item 1. Business.
 We are a clinical-stage cell and gene therapy company advancing a new class of treatments for patients with cancer and rare diseases. We have discovered and are developing a broad portfolio of product candidates in a variety of indications based on our core proprietary platforms, including our non-viral piggyBac DNA Delivery System, Cas-CLOVER Site-specific Gene Editing System and nanoparticle- and AAV-based gene delivery technologies.
 Our core platform technologies have utility, either alone or in combination, across many cell and gene therapeutic modalities and enable us to engineer our portfolio of product candidates that are designed to overcome the primary limitations of current generation cell and gene therapeutics.
 Cell Therapy
 Within cell therapy, we believe our technologies allow us to create product candidates with engineered cells, containing a high percentage of stem cell memory T-cells, or TSCM cells, that may engraft in the patient’s body and potentially drive lasting durable responses. Our chimeric antigen receptor T cell, or CAR-T, therapy portfolio currently consists of allogeneic, or off-the-shelf, product candidates. In the industry, allogeneic CAR-T cell products are earlier in development than the autologous products, due in part to the need for a gene editing technology in their production, but this approach has the potential to be the next significant advance in the field as ready to use, off-the-shelf products of consistently high quality. We have used the learnings of our autologous programs in both hematological and solid tumor indications to help inform our allogeneic programs. We are advancing a broad pipeline with CAR-T product candidates in both hematological and solid tumor oncology indications.
 We are internally focused on solid tumor cell therapy. P-MUC1C-ALLO1 is currently in a Phase 1 trial and has the potential to treat a wide range of solid tumors, including breast, ovarian and other epithelial-derived cancers. In December 2022, we announced early clinical data showing safety and efficacy. In addition, we have several additional solid tumor allogeneic programs advancing toward anticipated IND filings, including P-PSMA-ALLO1, a preclinical stage program being developed for the treatment of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC. This program is using the findings from our autologous version of this program, P-PSMA-101, in which we treated 38 patients in a Phase 1 study, and we believe these findings will be useful in the allogeneic program. We are also exploring a dual target solid tumor program, currently preclinical, of which the targets are not yet disclosed, as well as other combinations including potential dual products containing both a CAR-T and a T-cell receptor, or TCR.
 Strategic Partnership
 In August 2022, we announced a partnership with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., or, collectively Roche, in which they have licensed or optioned our lead hematological indications. Included in the upfront license, Roche licensed P-BCMA-ALLO1 and P-CD19CD20-ALLO1, or each, a Tier 1 program. P-BCMA-ALLO1 is currently in a Phase 1 trial, being developed for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, using the learnings from our first autologous program P-BCMA-101. P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 is currently a preclinical stage program being developed for the treatment of B-Cell hematological indications, for which we expect an IND filing in mid-2023. In addition to the two licensed programs, Roche has an option to license P-CD70-ALLO1 and P-BCMACD19-ALLO1, or each a Tier 2 program. P-CD70-ALLO1 is a preclinical stage program being developed to treat hematological indications. P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 is a preclinical dual target program, being developed to treat multiple myeloma. In addition to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 programs, we entered into a research collaboration, in which Roche has an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to six allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy products in hematological indications, or each, a Collaboration Program.
 Under the Collaboration and License Agreement that we entered into with Roche, or the Roche Collaboration Agreement, Roche made an upfront payment to us of $110.0 million. Subject to Roche exercising its Tier 2 Program
options, designating Collaboration Programs, and exercising its option for the Licensed Products, as defined below, commercial license and contingent on, among other things, the products from the Tier 1 Programs, optioned Tier 2 Programs and Collaboration Programs achieving specified development, regulatory, and net sales milestone events, we are eligible to receive certain reimbursements, fees and milestone payments, including the near-term fees and milestone payments described above, in the aggregate up to $6.0 billion, comprised of (i) $1.5 billion for the Tier 1 Programs; (ii) $1.1 billion for the Tier 2 Programs, (iii) $2.9 billion for the Collaboration Programs; and (iv) $415.0 million for the Licensed Products. We are further entitled to receive, on a product-by-product basis, tiered royalty payments in the mid-single to low double digits on net sales of products from the Tier 1 Programs, optioned Tier 2 Programs and Collaboration Programs and in the low to mid-single digits for Licensed Products, in each case, subject to certain customary reductions and offsets. Royalties will be payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering such product in such country or ten years from first commercial sale of such product in such country.

Gene Therapy
 Within gene therapy, we believe our technologies have the potential to create next generation therapies that can deliver long-term, stable gene expression that does not diminish over time and may have the capacity to result in single treatment cures. We believe our proprietary gene engineering technologies have the potential to address the limitations of the transient nature of traditional gene therapies, thereby offering distinct advantages starting in liver-directed gene therapy. Furthermore, we believe that we have the potential to pursue multiple in vivo and ex vivo approaches in a wide array of cell types and tissues for non-liver-directed gene therapies.
 We are internally focused on in vivo gene therapy. Our lead program, P-OTC-101, is a liver-directed gene therapy combining piggyBac technology with AAV and nanoparticles for the in vivo treatment of Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency, or OTCD. OTCD is an often fatal or morbid urea cycle disease caused by congenital mutations in the Ornithine Transcarbamylase, or OTC, gene with a high unmet medical need. We are developing the P-OTC-101 program utilizing a hybrid of non-viral nanoparticle delivery system to deliver RNA and AAV to deliver DNA and are working on an updated timeline for the program.
Strategic Partnership
 In October 2021, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Takeda, or the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Takeda a worldwide exclusive license under our piggyBac, Cas-CLOVER, biodegradable DNA and RNA nanoparticle delivery technology and other proprietary genetic engineering platforms to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy products for certain indications, including Hemophilia A. We collaborate with Takeda to initially develop up to six in vivo gene therapy programs and Takeda also has an option to add two additional programs to the collaboration. We are
obligated to lead research activities up to candidate selection, after which Takeda is obligated to assume responsibility for further development, manufacturing and commercialization of each program.
 Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, Takeda made an upfront payment to us of $45.0 million. Takeda is also obligated to provide funding for all collaboration program development costs including our P-FVIII-101 and P-PAH-101 programs; provided that we are obligated to perform certain platform development activities at our own cost. Timelines for P-FVIII-101, P-PAH-101 and other programs subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement will be driven by Takeda. Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible to receive preclinical milestone payments that could potentially exceed $82.5 million in the aggregate if preclinical milestones for all six programs are achieved. We are also eligible to receive future clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of $435.0 million in the aggregate per target, with a total potential deal value over the course of the collaboration of up to $2.7 billion, if milestones for all six programs are achieved and up to $3.6 billion if the milestones related to the two optional programs are also achieved. We are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments on net sales in the mid-single to low double digits, subject to certain standard reductions and offsets. Royalties will be payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering such product in such country, ten years from first commercial sale of such product in such country, or expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country.
 Gene Therapy Pipeline
 
Our Proprietary Cell and Gene Engineering Platform Technologies
 We have developed a proprietary suite of gene engineering technologies that have broad utility. The breadth and depth of our technology platforms fall into three primary categories: (1) gene insertion, (2) gene editing and (3) gene delivery, supported by additional CAR-T tools.
 •Gene insertion. Our proprietary, non-viral piggyBac DNA Delivery System, which includes our Super piggyBac transposase enzyme, is highly efficient at stable gene insertion and has a significantly larger genetic cargo capacity as compared to viral methods (potentially greater than 20x lentivirus). As a result, our product candidates can contain transgenes large enough to include multiple chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and/or T cell receptor, or TCR, genes, selection genes, safety switch genes and potentially other cargo for specific treatment applications, making it a highly versatile platform. Importantly, piggyBac works in a wide variety of cell types, both dividing and non-dividing, T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, induced pluripotent stem cells, primary hepatocytes and numerous other cell types giving it broad reach and applicability.
 •Gene editing with precise specificity. Our proprietary, highly precise Cas-CLOVER site-specific gene editing technology is easy to use, highly efficient and capable of multiplexing and has shown low to no off-target activity in our preclinical studies, which we believe provides a distinct tolerability advantage over other gene editing systems. In addition, unlike many other gene editing technologies, Cas-CLOVER can efficiently edit resting T cells, allowing for the maintenance of the highly desirable TSCM product composition in allogeneic product candidates, an important component of our CAR-T approach. 

Both of our proprietary site-specific gene editing platforms, Cas-CLOVER, and a related technology called TAL-CLOVER, can also be used for in vivo gene therapies.
 •Gene delivery. We have numerous technologies and platforms for delivering DNA, RNA and proteins, including into cells both ex vivo and in vivo. These include proprietary nanoparticle technology, AAV technology, and both ex vivo and in vivo electroporation, which is a process by which we use a pulse of electricity to briefly increase the permeability of cells.
 •Additional proprietary tools. We also have a number of other technologies and tools that have been developed for specific applications including:
 oTSCM Phenotype. We have developed and patented a number of manufacturing methods and media to preserve a high percentage of TSCM in our product candidates. We believe that the TSCM cell phenotype is key to success in CAR-T therapies.
 oPositive selection. We create product candidates utilizing a fully human drug resistance gene that can be employed during manufacturing to create a purified product that is essentially 100% CAR-positive, minimizing one of the sources of CAR-T toxicity and thereby potentially enhancing the therapeutic index. Our initial use for positive selection is for CAR-T, but this technology has utility in other cell types.
 oBooster molecules. We have developed a technology that enables improved expansion of gene-edited allogeneic cells without affecting their desirable TSCM characteristics. The booster molecule is an RNA-based technology introduced to T cells during the manufacturing process, which results in transient expression of a receptor on the surface of T cells that allows the cells to respond to antibody-based activator molecules, resulting in significant expansion of the cells without causing maturation or exhaustion of the cells. Using this approach, we can create potentially hundreds of doses from a single manufacturing run yet maintain the high percentage of desirable TSCM cells in the final product candidate. This technology is currently used in our allogeneic CAR-T programs but may have utility in other cell types.
 oSafety switch. We have developed a proprietary safety switch comprised of fully human genes that can be activated by administration of a small molecule, and thereafter, has the potential to rapidly eliminate some or all of the genetically modified cells in the patient after administration.
 oCAR binding modalities. In addition to traditional scFv binders, we have access to and utilize novel binder technologies, such as heavy-chain-only antibody fragments, which, compared to scFv, are more stable, result in less T cell exhaustion and may result in lower immunogenicity.
 oArmoring platforms. We can use our genetic engineering tools to make other modifications to our product candidates to potentially improve their performance against solid tumors, an approach commonly referred to as “armoring”. We have several types of armoring platforms:
 ▪Conditional gene expression system: Due to the very large cargo capacity of piggyBac, we have demonstrated the ability to deliver into the genome a conditional gene expression system that expresses one or more genes of interest only when the cell becomes activated or stimulated by binding of the CAR molecule to its specific target. This approach is superior to constitutive expression systems in that tight conditional regulation limits gene expression to relevant sites, such as the tumor microenvironment. In this way, supporting molecules such as pro/anti-inflammatory molecules, checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, interleukins and chemokines can be expressed by the T cell and/or delivered locally to the tumor or target cell.
 ▪Decoy receptors: CAR-T therapies can be enhanced by using piggyBac to deliver molecules that sequester and block negative immune regulators, such as PD-1 and TGFβR2. Decoy/null or positive switch receptors can be used to block or convert to activators, respectively, regulatory signals from the tumor microenvironment that otherwise work to exhaust T cell responses.
 ▪Gene knockout: Our Cas-CLOVER site-specific gene editing platform can be used to armor CAR-T therapies by targeting functional regulatory molecules, such as checkpoint blockade 

genes. These protein receptors are involved in exhaustion mechanisms by the tumor microenvironment.
 Gene insertion: piggyBac DNA Delivery System
 DNA transposons are genetic elements that efficiently move from a plasmid to a chromosome via a cut and paste mechanism. DNA transposons have been used as a gene transfer method, including in CAR-T manufacturing. The piggyBac DNA Delivery System is our proprietary non-viral gene engineering technology that can be used to add therapeutic transgene DNA to the genome using the highly efficient Super piggyBac transposase enzyme, a hyperactive enzyme that was genetically modified to enable very high efficiency transposition of piggyBac transposons. We believe piggyBac enables efficient and precise transposition and multiple differentiated product attributes.
 The image below depicts the piggyBac DNA Delivery System:
 
Therapeutic genes encoded within the cargo region of the piggyBac DNA transposon transgene are flanked by non-translated inverted terminal repeat sequences, or ITRs, that are specifically recognized by the transposase enzyme for the highly efficient process of stably integrating the therapeutic transgene cargo into specific sequences (TTAA nucleotides) in the genome. The transposase enzyme can be co-delivered to the cell as a protein or encoded in either DNA or RNA.
 The piggyBac platform is our core technology used for the development of CAR-T and other gene therapy product candidates in our pipeline. We believe our piggyBac DNA Delivery System enables multiple differentiated product attributes including:
 •CAR-T product candidates with a high percentage of desirable TSCM cells, leading to better engraftment and duration of response with the potential for re-response, as well as a better tolerability profile;
 •very large cargo capacity (potentially greater than 20x lentivirus)—allows efficient delivery of large therapeutic transgenes, including the possibility of multiple CAR or TCR molecules and incorporation of selection genes, safety switches and/or armoring strategies;

•non-viral delivery system that reduces the risk of mutagenesis and oncogenesis compared to viral delivery systems;
 •high insertion efficiency and stable therapeutic transgene expression in a wide range of dividing and non-dividing cells and tissues; and
 •shorter timelines and less costly manufacturing than viral methods.
 The piggyBac transposon preferentially transposes therapeutic transgenes into early memory T cells, including TSCM cells. We believe retroviral transgene delivery methods, such as lentivirus and γ-retrovirus, are not efficient at delivering transgenes into early memory T cells. This is a key differentiator that allows us to manufacture CAR-T products with a high percentage of TSCM cells, giving them desirable characteristics.
 While the genetic cargo capacity of viruses typically used in CAR-T manufacturing, such as lentivirus and γ-retrovirus, is limited to approximately 10-20 kilobases, or kb, piggyBac has demonstrated cargo delivery of greater than 200 kb, allowing transfer of multiple useful genes. The very large cargo capacity of piggyBac permits incorporation of multiple genes into our product candidates to further enhance tolerability and potency, with all CAR-T cells in our current CAR-T product candidates carrying a CAR molecule gene, a safety switch gene and a selection gene. The cargo capacity also allows for packaging of multiple CAR-T encoding genes and/or TCR genes allowing for the creation of dual and other multi-CAR-T product candidates.
 PiggyBac ITRs and other components act as strong insulators, ensuring stable transgene expression and reducing risks of oncogenesis. PiggyBac has shown lower integration into intragenic regions compared with lentivirus, meaning that it is less likely to cause a detrimental mutation.
 Additionally, piggyBac is estimated to have a significantly lower cost in production of GMP material and a much shorter timeline for GMP production as compared to GMP production of viral vectors.
 The image below depicts our piggyBac transposon transgene approach for creating CAR-T product candidates:
 
Gene Editing with Precise Specificity: Cas-CLOVER Site-Specific Gene Editing Technology
We have developed gene editing technology that uses a proprietary obligate homodimer nuclease system named CLOVER, which consists of parts of the Type IIS restriction endonuclease, Clo051. Genome cutting by this enzyme is strictly dependent upon dimerization, which makes it a fully dimeric system and gives it precise site-specificity. Cas-CLOVER uses a CRISPR (Clustered, Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) associated protein 9, or Cas9, enzyme that has been permanently altered and is unable to cut DNA (called dCas9). The dCas9 acts only as a DNA binding protein when combined with an appropriate guide RNA (gRNA). Cas-CLOVER combines the advantages of the first-generation CRISPR system (ease of design, low cost, multiplexing ability) with the advantages of the obligate homodimer nuclease systems (precise specificity). Importantly for T cell applications, Cas-CLOVER works well in resting T cells, which allows us to avoid maturation and exhaustion during production and assists in preserving the TSCM phenotype.


The most widely used platform for gene editing is CRISPR and an associated protein, Cas9. This gene editing technology is derived from a naturally occurring viral defense mechanism in bacteria. It works by binding the Cas9 enzyme to guide RNA, which can direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence to make cuts in double-stranded DNA. Once the DNA is cut, the cell uses naturally occurring DNA repair mechanisms to rejoin the cut ends.
 The CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been shown to result in unwanted off-target cutting, which means additional cutting at unintended sites that are often similar but not identical to the target DNA site. This off-target cutting can result in permanent mutations to the genomic DNA, which may unintentionally lead to detrimental mutations and oncogenesis, thereby creating significant safety concerns when used for the manufacture of cell and gene therapeutics.
 Another popular site-specific gene editing platform used for cell and gene therapeutic applications are the Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases, or TALENs. They are constructed by fusing a TAL DNA-binding domain to a DNA cleavage domain, typically FokI, which functions as an obligate homodimer, meaning two half-sites must come together at the exact same place and the exact same time in order to make a cut. Given the requirement for two half-sites, this type of system is sometimes called a fully dimeric system.
 While TALEN technology can often cut specific sites in DNA with much higher fidelity than CRISPR/Cas9, it is relatively labor intensive and expensive to build. Conceptually similar, ZFN technology is a gene editing technology comprised of a class of DNA binding proteins used to make double-stranded breaks in DNA. Like TALEN technology, ZFN requires more preparation and work to use through the creation of arrays needed to target specific desired edits. TALEN and ZFN technologies both require activation of the cells to edit and do not work well in resting T cells, and thus fail to preserve a high percentage of the TSCM phenotype for CAR-T.
 Another emerging gene editing technology is known as base editors. Base editing uses components from CRISPR systems together with other enzymes to directly install point mutations into cellular DNA or RNA without making double-stranded DNA breaks. DNA base editors comprise a catalytically disabled nuclease fused to a nucleobase deaminase enzyme and, in some cases, a DNA glycosylase inhibitor. Base editing technology is known to create some level of unwanted off-target mutations but the full extent is not yet known and could present a safety concern for allogeneic CAR-T where products could be given to many patients.
 Gene Delivery Technologies: Nanoparticle Technology, In vivo and Ex vivo Electroporation and AAV
 In addition to our piggyBac platform for non-viral gene insertion and our Cas-CLOVER platform for gene editing, we have developed a set of platform technologies for gene delivery to allow us to deliver RNA, DNA and proteins into cells both ex vivo and in vivo for various applications. These technologies include nanoparticle technology, AAV technology and ex vivo and in vivo electroporation technologies and approaches. Because of the
breath of potential utility of piggyBac and Cas-CLOVER, we foresee a need for different delivery modalities for different applications.
 In our allogeneic CAR-T product candidates, we edit the T cells ex vivo using electroporation to deliver the necessary piggyBac components required to stably insert the therapeutic transgene into the genome of the cells. We also introduce Cas-CLOVER into the T cells via electroporation to edit the cells to eliminate alloreactivity.
 In some of our liver-directed gene therapy programs, we use AAV technology and lipid nanoparticles, or LNPs, to deliver piggyBac to the liver in vivo. We have developed a variety of distinct and proprietary nanoparticle compositions to achieve different delivery objectives. These nanoparticles fall generally into two categories, polymersomes and LNPs. Polymersomes are single component particles comprised of novel block co-polymers and are designed to deliver large complex molecules such as proteins. LNPs are multi-component nanoparticles composed of known and novel lipids and are designed to deliver nucleic acids including mRNA and DNA. We are evaluating these nanoparticle concepts to deliver both our piggyBac and Cas-CLOVER technologies.
 Our longer-term goal for our nanoparticle platform is to be able to eliminate the need for AAV for in vivo gene therapies by using nanoparticles to deliver our technologies into cells. We have nominated one program, P-FVIII-101, using our fully non-viral delivery technology, and are actively maturing our proprietary nanoparticle technology platform to enable additional programs.
 Cell Therapy
 Addressing the Limitations of Early-Generation CAR-T Therapies
 Although early-generation CAR-T therapy has shown significant potential, there are a number of limitations. The great majority of early-generation and current CAR-T therapies are produced using viral-based manufacturing. We believe that there are a number of inherent problems related to viral-based manufacturing that limit the potential of other CAR-T therapies. T cell engineering is typically achieved via viral transduction, the process of introducing foreign DNA into a cell using a virus, most notably with retroviruses, such as γ–retrovirus or lentivirus.
 Despite extensive optimization of these viral vectors, their limitations are becoming more evident, including safety concerns regarding the insertional profile, limited genetic cargo capacity, and undesirable characteristics of the final product. We use our proprietary non-viral piggyBac DNA Delivery System to deliver CAR molecule genes to T cells. The most significant advantage of using a non-viral approach is the ability to generate CAR-T products comprised of a high percentage of TSCM cells. We believe this has the potential to result in therapies that elicit more consistent and durable responses with less toxicity. Additionally, we believe our non-viral approach will have much lower manufacturing costs and shorter manufacturing timelines. We have also developed allogeneic, or off-the-shelf, CAR-T therapies from healthy donors that will be potentially as good as or better than autologous CAR-T products, and be available off-the-shelf at a fraction of the cost of autologous therapies.
Cell Type Matters - Stem Cell Memory
 TSCM cells are believed to be ideal for cell therapy because they have the potential to engraft, be long-lived, self-renewing and multi-potent in that they can create wave after wave of more differentiated cells. There is a one-way maturation pathway from TSCM cells to central memory T cells, or TCM; then to effector memory T cells, or TEM; and lastly, to TEFF cells. As T cells mature and differentiate, their core functions and capabilities change, impacting their potency and durability. Our approach is to utilize a high percentage of less differentiated T cells in our product candidates with the goal of increasing persistence and mitigating some of the key limitations of early-generation CAR-T products. We also believe that creating a product with high TSCM may be why we have seen such success in clinical efficacy for solid tumors where the TSCM cells can engraft and create wave after wave of cells to attack the tumor. Conceptually, products that are more maturated and contain more effector cells are like a drug, whereas our products that have a high percentage of TSCM cells are like a prodrug. The TSCM cells do not kill tumor cells, they engraft and create the more differentiated cells that do the killing.
The following figure illustrates this one-way T cell maturation pathway, from TSCM cell to TEFF cell:

Based upon our clinical data to date from our former autologous product candidates, we have observed a strong correlation between the percentage of TSCM in the product candidate and best clinical response. In addition to our own experience, there is growing evidence and recognition that TSCM is correlated with efficacy in the clinic.
 Gene Editing
 Gene editing tools are widely used to eliminate expression of certain cell surface molecules, which may be used to avoid the potential reactivity of donor cells against the patient, which results in graft-vs-host disease, or GvHD, as well as the reactivity of the patient’s cells against the CAR-T product, a reaction called host-vs-graft. We believe it is imperative to use gene editing tools that can efficiently edit resting T cells when creating an allogeneic CAR-T product, as activating T cells will initiate the maturation pathway. Once T cells begin maturating, they start to lose their desirable TSCM characteristics and thereby become exhausted, rendering the resulting product less efficacious.
 Unlike many other gene editing technologies, our approach using Cas-CLOVER can efficiently edit resting T cells, allowing for the maintenance of the highly desirable TSCM product composition in allogeneic product candidates, an important component of our CAR-T approach. Our goal with all of our allogeneic product candidates is to create a product with a profile comparable to or better than an autologous version of the same product and in the case of our first fully allogeneic product candidate for multiple myeloma, P-BCMA-ALLO1, our efficacy benchmark will be against P-BCMA-101 and other BCMA targeting programs.
 Cost, Scale & Reach
Despite the potent activity from early CAR-T entrants to the market, commercial adoption has been relatively slow to date. We believe that there are two main hurdles to widespread adoption of CAR-T. The first hurdle is cost. The therapies themselves can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and there are potentially significant additional costs from managing the occasionally substantial toxicities from the early-generation CAR-T therapies. The second hurdle is the toxicities themselves. While some progress is being made in managing the side effects, the risk remains significant for many patients, requiring that these early generation CAR-T products to be administered only in large hospitals and treatment centers with intensive care units, as compared to more accessible community hospitals and outpatient infusion centers.

We believe that our approach could enable us to address these hurdles to unlock the potential of CAR-T therapies. The combination of our higher percentage TSCM product and a potentially improved tolerability profile may allow us to move beyond academic medical centers and broaden the reach of these products. In our first clinical trial, P-BCMA-101, we were already dosing on a fully outpatient basis, following discussions with the FDA and similarly, have received clearance for outpatient dosing on our P-MUC1C-ALLO1. We believe outpatient dosing will enable expanded reach and lower cost. In addition, our booster molecule technology allows us to drive scale to our allogeneic manufacturing process, resulting from the ability to produce potentially hundreds of doses of our allogeneic CAR-T product candidates from a single manufacturing run from a single healthy donor. This dramatically reduces the manufacturing cost of CAR-T therapy to levels in the range of traditional biologic therapeutics in oncology and enabling off-the-shelf availability for immediate use.
 CAR-T in Hematological Tumors
Early-generation CAR-T therapeutics have demonstrated an ability to achieve impressive responses in hematological malignancies, even in pre-treated patients who are relapsed and/or refractory to prior lines of standard therapies. Dramatically higher response rates than those reported for all prior therapeutics have been achieved in some indications, with some patients likely being cured. Despite these outcomes, however, significant challenges remain with regard to safety and cost. Furthermore, we believe additional improvements could be made with regard to duration of response as a number of patients have relapsed after receiving CAR-T therapy and duration of response has generally been poor.
 A major limitation of early-generation CAR-T therapies is the potential for severe toxicity, most notably CRS and neurotoxicity, either of which can be fatal. Current CAR-T therapeutics are administered at large medical centers with ICUs so that an ICU can be reserved for all patients being administered CAR-T in the case they experience these severe toxicities. Furthermore, the cost of dealing with the toxicities associated with CAR-T can oftentimes exceed the cost of the therapeutic itself. There are also significant cost, manufacturing and commercial scalability challenges ahead for other CAR-T candidates, mainly due to the nature of viral-based manufacturing. These issues greatly limit the commercial reach of current CAR-T products. There are several potential reasons for the poor duration of response, which generally fall into two categories: elimination of the CAR-T cells from the body and loss of expression of a CAR-T target on a tumor cell, known as antigen escape.
 Safety
 The excitement over the impressive responses seen initially with early-generation CAR-T approaches has unfortunately been tempered by potentially life-threatening toxicities, most notably CRS and neurotoxicity. Typical clinical symptoms of neurotoxicity include headache, confusion, delirium, language disturbance and seizures. As more is being understood about these toxicities, it is now appreciated that they may be caused by different molecular mechanisms. However, both are rooted in a T cell response that is essentially too rapid and too strong. The CAR-T cells and other immune cells of the patient release cytokines and other molecules that initiate immune cascades that can be fatal if not avoided or successfully treated.
 TSCM cells express fewer cytotoxic effector molecules than more maturated T cells and are postulated to differentiate and develop cytotoxic capability gradually. We believe the TSCM cell phenotype may lead to a more controlled expansion of CAR-T and more gradual killing of tumor cells, thereby lessening the severity of toxicities, such as CRS and neurotoxicity, and resulting in a CAR-T product that can be administered on a fully outpatient basis.
 A second safety feature incorporated into our CAR-T product candidates is the positive selection for CAR-positive cells during the manufacturing process. Drug resistance genes have been employed in other cellular therapeutics as a mechanism for selecting and purifying gene-modified cells to improve the efficiency of gene therapy. Our product candidates are engineered to express a variant of the human dihydrofolate reductase, or DHFR, gene. Cells containing this variant of the DHFR gene are slightly resistant to the drug methotrexate, or MTX. The advantage of DHFR over other drug-resistance strategies is that MTX is not genotoxic and preferentially kills dividing cells. Importantly, this gene-drug combination has been previously demonstrated to permit ex vivo selection of genetically modified T cells with relatively low concentrations of MTX.

Additionally, we enrich for gene-modified CAR-positive cells during ex vivo expansion, thereby purifying the therapeutic product and controlling for any patient-to-patient variability in raw material or manufacture, making our CAR-T product candidates essentially 100% CAR-positive. This contrasts with competing products that do not utilize positive selection and typically contain a significant number of CAR-negative cells that cannot kill cancer cells but are artificially activated and expanded outside of the body and may contribute to CRS and/or neurotoxicity. Thus, we believe that positive selection is another mechanism, in addition to the high percentage of TSCM cells, that may result in our CAR-T product candidates having a significantly greater therapeutic index.
 Given that every CAR-T cell has a transgene, which is stably integrated into the genome, there is the possibility that the transgene delivery part of the CAR-T manufacturing process could create a detrimental mutation that allows the cell to expand in an uncontrolled manner, which can result in the cell itself becoming cancerous. Additionally, in the case of viral-manufacturing, some viral components that are integrated into the CAR-T cell as part of the transgene, such as the long terminal repeats, or LTRs, of the transgene may be able to activate a gene already in the cell, resulting in the cell becoming cancerous, a process called oncogenesis.
 There has been an example of a clonal expansion in a patient who received a CAR-T product made from lentivirus. A clonal expansion means that a single T cell was given a proliferative advantage and was able to grow to a majority of all the CAR-positive cells in the patient. In this case, the clonal expansion was caused by the lentivirus inserting into a gene important for proliferation. Our CAR-T product candidates utilize our proprietary piggyBac technology. PiggyBac has shown low integration into intragenic regions, meaning that it is less likely to cause a detrimental mutation. Also, unlike retroviruses, piggyBac does not contain LTR sequences, but rather ITRs and other components which act as strong insulators, enhancing stable transgene expression and lowering risk of oncogenesis.
 We have included a cellular safety switch in each of our product candidates as an additional safety mechanism. Both CRS and neurotoxicity are thought to be related to an overactive T cell response. Therefore, timely intervention to diminish the number of CAR-T cells should be an effective method of managing the majority of adverse events. We believe an ideal intervention technique is one that could be titrated such that not all CAR-T cells would be eliminated, leaving some for continued therapeutic effect.
 Commercial Scalability
 Another challenge with early-generation CAR-T products is their commercial scalability. Autologous CAR-T products are, by definition, individualized products. They are also typically expensive to produce, particularly when using viral-based manufacturing methods. We believe our non-viral piggyBac approach is more efficient and cost effective than historical CAR-T methods as it utilizes GMP nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, which are faster and cheaper to produce than GMP virus. We have further optimized the manufacturing process to eliminate some of the costly materials associated with the viral-based methods, including magnetic beads and cytokines.
 CAR-T products that elicit severe and potentially fatal toxicities, such as CRS and neurotoxicity, require that the drug be administered in a tertiary care hospital where the physicians are familiar with treating these toxicities and where admission to an intensive care unit is an option. The potential for these severe toxicities currently precludes administration in community hospitals or outpatient infusion centers. In our dose-escalation P-BCMA-101 Phase 1 clinical trial, to our knowledge no patient has had to be admitted to intensive care units for CRS or neurotoxicity. Based on these results, and following discussions with the FDA, we were able to dose on a fully outpatient basis. As we evaluate initial findings on our P-BCMA-ALLO1 program, if we continue to see the same safety responses as we did in the autologous trial, we plan to pursue outpatient dosing as well.
 Efficacy Challenge: Elimination of CAR-T Cells
 There are numerous explanations as to why CAR-T cells are eliminated from a patient after administration, but we believe the primary explanation is that the majority of T cells in other CAR-T products are more maturated and short-lived T cells, including TEFF cells. Not all T cells are created equally, and we believe the ability to develop a product that consists predominantly of early memory T cells, particularly TSCM cells, is the key to increasing duration of response and tolerability. Our non-viral piggyBac manufacturing method is the only commercially viable
approach known to us that can create CAR-T products with a high percentage of the highly desirable TSCM cells with the efficiency of our technology.
 In order to test the ability of our piggyBac DNA Delivery System to preferentially deliver CAR-containing transgenes to TSCM cells, we conducted a preclinical experiment in which we separated T cells into their various subtypes, then individually put those subsets through either an optimized piggyBac manufacturing process or an optimized lentivirus process and measured the percentage of transposed or transduced cells in each final product subset. As shown in the figures below, piggyBac was very efficient at transposing (the piggyBac process of delivering the CAR-containing transgene) in TSCM cells, while lentivirus was relatively ineffective at transducing (the lentiviral process of delivering the CAR-containing transgene) in TSCM cells. We measured both CD4+ T cells (also known as T helper cells) and CD8+ T cells (also known as cytotoxic T cells) which represent two subsets of T cells believed to interact and be important in immune function and T cell response.
 
Given the one-way maturation pathway of T cells, we believe utilizing a genetic engineering method that preferentially modifies TSCM cells is essential for creating a final product with a high percentage of TSCM cells. During manufacturing, once we have completed the genetic modification step, we then perform a positive selection step to eliminate cells that have not been modified. Lastly, we activate and expand the remaining cells under conditions that favor self-renewal of TSCM cells without differentiation, resulting in a product that has a high percentage of TSCM cells, even when starting with patient material with a relatively low percentage of TSCM cells. Our non-viral piggyBac DNA Delivery System typically yields TSCM cell percentages reaching as high as 80%. We compared our piggyBac manufacturing method to a lentivirus-based manufacturing method that utilizes alternative media (Aim V, Thermo Fisher Scientific), different T cell stimulation (CD3/CD28 beads from Dynal/Thermo Fisher Scientific) and virus for vector integration (lentivirus). The sorted T cell subsets were put through the piggyBac process once in a pilot experiment with cells from one donor, and again in a comparison with the lentivirus process with cells from three donors. The early memory component, or combined TSCM and TCM cells, typically comprise greater than 90% of the cells of our product candidates. Notably, in December 2019, we were issued a U.S. patent that has claims that cover any modified T cell product that has 25% or more TSCM cells.
 Others in the field of CAR-T development are also attempting to increase the percentage of TSCM cells in their products through alternative methods during the manufacturing process, including the addition of small molecule inhibitor drugs and various cytokines, reducing the time in culture, and physically enriching through sorting methods for early T cells. However, we believe these methods all have inherent problems that will limit the ability to successfully create a final product candidate with a high percentage of TSCM cells.
 In both our own clinical data and in data published and presented by others, a higher percentage of TSCM cells in CAR-T products have been shown to correlate with clinical response, and our CAR-T product candidates contain
a high percentage of TSCM cells. Our goal is that our product candidates will overcome the limitations of other CAR-T products in many respects, including potency and durability of response.
 More maturated T cells, which already have a short lifespan compared with TSCM cells, can be eliminated from the patient due to their inability to persist, leading to poor efficacy of the product. One reason that premature loss of CAR-T occurs is the presence of CAR binding molecules on the surface of the T cell that can interact with each other. This results in crosslinking of the CAR molecule and a phenomenon called tonic signaling, in which the CAR-T cells are essentially always stimulated and active. Tonic signaling results in premature loss of efficacy, poor expansion and cell death, referred to as T cell exhaustion. We use binding molecules, such as heavy-chain-only antibody fragments and carefully selected single-chain fragment variable antibodies to minimize the risk of crosslinking and tonic signaling.
 Efficacy Challenge: Antigen Escape and Antibodies
 Some CAR-T products have been shown to lose efficacy due to what is called antigen escape, which occurs when expression of a CAR-T target on a tumor cell is lost or drastically reduced due to selective pressure from the CAR-T therapeutic, resulting in an expansion of the tumor cells that have escaped the ability of the CAR-T to kill them. To avoid antigen escape, we have focused our efforts on selecting targets where we believe expression is less likely to be reduced. For example, BCMA is important for cell proliferation, and so is considered less likely to be lost by the tumor cell following CAR-T treatment.
 Another method to prevent antigen escape involves pursuing multiple targets on the cancer cell with the same CAR-T product. The likelihood that a cancer cell will be able to simultaneously downregulate or lose expression of multiple targets, as opposed to any single target, is greatly reduced. While the genetic cargo capacity of viral vectors is quite limited, piggyBac has demonstrated the ability to deliver greater than 20 times more genetic cargo capacity, allowing transfer of multiple CAR molecule genes simultaneously. We believe the large genetic cargo capacity of piggyBac could allow us to further address antigen escape by including two or more CARs or TCRs on the same T cell. We have several Dual CAR programs currently in preclinical development designed to seek improved efficacy including potentially addressing antigen escape in various indications.
 In our P-BCMA-101 Phase 1 clinical trial, we observed that some patients have formed antibodies, also known as anti-drug antibodies in response to our treatment. This is not uncommon in biologic drug development, including CAR-T development. Based upon our data to date, it appears that anti-drug antibodies are more likely to form at higher dose cohorts. In our expanded Phase 1 clinical trial for P-BCMA-101 we investigated additional dosing strategies that may reduce or eliminate the impact of anti-drug antibodies, including administering the dose in smaller cycles over the first 30 days and adding rituximab to the preconditioning regimen to potentially suppress any antibody response. As presented at ASH in December 2021, the P-BCMA-101 arm using rituximab showed the absence of antidrug antibodies.
 CAR-T in Solid Tumors
Efficacy Challenge
 In addition to the standard concerns regarding persistence of T cells in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, there are factors that exacerbate this problem when using CAR-T products for the treatment of solid tumors. To date, the great majority of early-generation CAR-T products have not demonstrated significant responses in solid tumors and there are a number of potential explanations for this poor efficacy. First, it is possible that CAR-T cells have more difficulty accessing solid tumor cells. In some diseases, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the tumor cells are easily accessible by the CAR-T cells. However, in most solid tumors, there are a number of factors that may make it more difficult for CAR-T cells to access the tumor. Second, it is possible that solid tumor cells have changes in expression of certain checkpoint genes that render them resistant to killing by T cells. Third, the center of many solid tumors is very hypoxic, or low in oxygen concentration, and this environment is not thought to be conducive to T cell function.
 There have been a few exceptions to the poor efficacy of CAR-T in solid tumors, notably in glioblastoma multiforme and hepatocellular carcinoma, where treatment with CAR-T has led to complete responses, or a CR, in
solid tumors. In these rare cases, the patient was treated with numerous administrations of CAR-T product. Though CAR-T cells are not as effective against solid tumor cells as they are against hematological tumor cells, this can potentially be overcome by giving multiple administrations of CAR-T, resulting in numerous waves of more maturated T cells killing the cancer cells. This approach would be more viable if there were an unlimited number of cells with which to treat the patient. However, manufacturing early-generation CAR-T products is relatively time consuming and expensive, and the final product is comprised of a limited number of cells, thereby making this approach impractical for many patients.
 Our solid tumor product candidates, including P-MUC1C-ALLO1, are comprised of a high percentage of TSCM cells, which we believe are able to engraft, self-renew and mature into every T cell subtype, including the TEFF cells, which can persistently attack the tumor until deep responses are potentially achieved. Therefore, we believe our CAR-T product candidates have the potential to achieve high rates of response against solid tumors with a single administration. In early clinical results from P-PSMA-101, our first solid tumor program, we have seen promising efficacy. As reported on February 17, 2022, of the first 14 patients, 71% have seen a reduction of PSA, of which in 36% of patients saw a PSA reduction of greater than 50%. In addition, one patient demonstrated evidence of near complete tumor elimination as evidenced by PSMA PET and other markers.
Safety
 Our solutions for addressing CAR-T related toxicity concerns regarding CRS and neurotoxicity with respect to hematological tumors also apply to solid tumors. However, there are additional toxicity concerns for CAR-T products when administered to treat solid tumors. When compared to hematological tumors, solid tumors generally have fewer unique surface targets that are not also expressed on healthy cells, so greater care must be taken when choosing targets to avoid on-target/off-tumor toxicity, which occurs when a CAR-T cell recognizes the intended target on a healthy cell and kills that cell. We seek to address this risk by choosing targets that are overexpressed in cancer cells, such as MUC1-C, and by using binding molecules that we believe are more effective at binding the cancerous form of the target.
 In our P-PSMA-101 trial, we experienced a clinical hold early in the study to evaluate the death of a patient, which may have been related to treatment with P-PSMA-101 but also partially due to a patient noncompliance event. Following protocol amendments, the clinical hold was lifted and we have since dosed additional patients in the trial without experiencing additional patient deaths potentially related to treatment. As reported on February 17, 2022 at ASCO-GU, we observed CRS in 57% of patients, with 14% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher and observed immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or ICANS in 14% of the evaluable patients. We wound-down this program in 2022 to focus on our allogeneic version of this product candidate, P-PSMA-ALLO1.
 As we expand our solid tumor CAR-T pipeline, we expect it to become harder to identify targets that are unique to the solid tumor cells. Therefore, we are developing sophisticated systems designed to direct a CAR-T cell to kill a tumor cell based on presence or absence of a combination of targets. For example, we believe that we can develop a CAR-T that will kill only tumor cells that have both target A and target B on their surface but will not kill normal cells with target A or target B singularly on their surface.
 A related strategy is developing a CAR-T that will kill a cell only if it expresses target A and B (which may be present on both cancer cells and normal cells) but not target C (which may only be present on normal cells). All such strategies require the co-expression of more than two CAR molecules on the surface of the same CAR-T cell. We believe the piggyBac DNA Delivery System can enable these approaches due to its large genetic cargo capacity. In contrast, viral-based approaches are typically unable to deliver more than two full-length CAR molecules.
We have demonstrated that we can produce CAR-T cells that express up to four full-length CAR molecule genes, each with a different target specificity, along with two additional genes, using a single piggyBac transposon
in manufacturing (left panel). We further demonstrated that, when expressed, all CAR molecules perform specific killing of corresponding cell lines that express the target (right panel):

Specific killing was evaluated via reporter-based killing assays where the indicated human tumor cells were genetically modified to express the luciferase gene. These tumor cells were co-cultured in vitro with CAR-T cells for 24 hours at a defined effector to target ratio of ten to one (10:1). The CAR-T cells expressed different combinations of full-length CARs: (1) BCMA CARTyrin, (2) BCMA CARTyrin and PSMA CARTyrin, (3) BCMA CARTyrin, PSMA CARTyrin and CD19 scFv-based CAR or (4) BCMA CARTyrin, PSMA CARTyrin, CD19 scFV-based CAR and GD2 scFv-based CAR. Cytotoxicity (specific lysis) was evaluated by adding luciferin substrate and reading luminescence signal and percent cytotoxicity was calculated by enumerating the luminescence of tumor cells alone versus tumor cells with CAR-T cells. Each individual CAR demonstrated cytotoxicity against its cognate antigen, even when expressed in the presence of three additional full-length CARs.
 Another approach to treating solid tumors is to express a variation of a TCR that is specific for a cancer-associated protein that is only expressed inside of the cancer cell, in contrast to a CAR molecule that only recognizes targets on the surface of the cell. We believe we can use the TCR strategy in combination with the CAR strategy by expressing combinations of both CAR and TCR molecules on the surface of the same cell using the piggyBac manufacturing method.
 Commercial Scalability
 We believe each of the commercial and scalability benefits of our approach in hematological tumors would also apply to solid tumors.
 Allogeneic or Off-The-Shelf CAR-T Therapies
 Efficacy Challenge
 The goal of an allogeneic, or off-the-shelf, CAR-T product is to create a large number of doses of CAR-T from a single donor or cell line. A successful allogeneic CAR-T product could be used as an off-the-shelf product to treat any patient with a specific indication, thereby greatly decreasing the costs associated with manufacturing. However, if an allogeneic product requires high doses or multiple doses in order to achieve the same activity as a similar autologous product, then many of the potential cost-saving advantages of an allogeneic product would not be realized.
 Gene editing tools are widely used to eliminate expression of certain cell surface molecules, which may be used to avoid the potential reactivity of donor cells against the patient, which results in graft-vs-host disease, or GvHD, as well as the reactivity of the patient’s cells against the CAR-T product, a reaction called host-vs-graft. We believe it is imperative to use gene editing tools that can efficiently edit resting T cells when creating an allogeneic CAR-T product, as activating T cells will initiate the maturation pathway. Once T cells begin maturating, they start
to lose their desirable TSCM characteristics and thereby become exhausted, rendering the resulting product less efficacious.
 Unlike many other gene editing technologies, Cas-CLOVER can efficiently edit resting T cells, allowing for the maintenance of the highly desirable TSCM product composition in allogeneic product candidates, an important component of our CAR-T approach. Our goal with all of our allogeneic product candidates is to create a product with a profile comparable to or better than an autologous version of the same product; in the case of our first fully allogeneic product candidate for multiple myeloma, P-BCMA-ALLO1, our efficacy benchmark will be against P-BCMA-101 and other BCMA targeting programs.
 Safety
 In addition to the standard concerns regarding CRS and neurotoxicity, there are additional safety concerns relative to an allogeneic product. As mentioned above, an allogeneic product can cause two forms of alloreactivity: GvHD and host-vs-graft. Host-vs-graft is concerning only in that it may cause premature elimination of the allogeneic CAR-T cells, resulting in all of the previously discussed efficacy challenges related to poor persistence of product, but it does not create a safety concern.
 However, GvHD, a situation where the CAR-T cells are killing the healthy cells of the patient, is a serious and potentially fatal condition. Studies have suggested that the endogenous TCR is the molecule that needs to be eliminated in order to prevent GvHD. If this molecule is not completely eliminated in nearly 100% of CAR-T cells, then GvHD may become a problem. Our highly efficient Cas-CLOVER technology and subsequent purification step has resulted in cells that have TCR expression eliminated from at least 99% of the cells, a level we believe to be safely above that required to prevent GvHD.
 An advantage of an allogeneic product is that many doses can be generated from a single individual donor or cell line. However, a potential disadvantage is that any detrimental mutation created during manufacturing would be potentially present in doses given to many patients, as opposed to an autologous product where this risk is limited to the individual patient. Therefore, it is especially important to minimize or completely prevent unwanted off-target mutations. It is well known that some gene editing technologies, such as CRISPR, have the possibility of creating unwanted mutations. In preclinical testing, our Cas-CLOVER technology has shown precise site-specificity, having no or very little propensity for creating off-target mutations. Based on our own preclinical data and previously published results on other fully dimeric CRISPR systems, we believe Cas-CLOVER is the most specific gene editing method available.
 Commercial Scalability
 A fully allogeneic CAR-T product offers the possibility of significant time and cost savings in manufacturing, thereby greatly decreasing the cost per dose and increasing patient accessibility. Nonetheless, a manufacturing process must still be run on individual donor or cell line material in order to create a fixed number of doses of an allogeneic product. One of the most expensive parts of a manufacturing run for viral-based manufacturing methods is the virus itself. The piggyBac manufacturing system uses only GMP DNA and RNA without the need for GMP virus. We believe this will result in product candidates that are significantly cheaper to produce, even in the context of an allogeneic CAR-T product. Furthermore, the development and manufacturing timelines for piggyBac are shorter than those for virus, meaning one can move from product concept to GMP material more quickly. As an example, we moved P-BCMA-101 from product concept to the first patient dosed in a clinical trial in less than two years, and we believe we can apply these learnings to meet or exceed these timelines for future product candidates.
 Genetic modification of the TCR, necessary to avoid GvHD as discussed previously, creates T cells that may be difficult to expand during the manufacturing process. TCR is commonly used as a key receptor for T cell stimulation in most autologous CAR-T manufacturing strategies. However, in allogeneic strategies, knockout of any single component of the TCR causes loss of the entire TCR complex from the surface of the engineered T cell, thereby significantly reducing its responsiveness to anti-CD3 antibodies during manufacturing. These consequences of eliminating the TCR and other genetic modifications have been commonly referred to as the “Allo Tax.” The TCR complex is depicted in the figure below.


We have developed proprietary booster molecules that have the potential to overcome this issue, while retaining and potentially increasing the percentage of TSCM cells in the final product. Booster molecules are an RNA-based technology introduced to T cells during the manufacturing process, which results in transient expression of a receptor on the surface of T cells that allows the cells to respond to antibody-based activator molecules, resulting in significant expansion of the cells without causing maturation or exhaustion of the cells. The use of a proprietary booster molecule resulted in enhanced expansion and yield, resulting in the production of more than five-fold the number of cells than without the booster molecule from a single manufacturing run (see figure below).
 
We believe that we can create fully allogeneic product candidates retain a profile that is comparable to their corresponding autologous products, as applicable, but with the ability to create enough doses to potentially treat hundreds of patients from a single manufacturing run.

Dual CAR-T Allogeneic Program Candidates
The very large cargo capacity of piggyBac allows for the inclusion of much larger or more therapeutic transgenes compared to viral-based technologies. We believe that our ability to include two or more fully functional CAR and/or TCR molecules into a T cell could be a significant competitive advantage. Unlike some competitors that have tried to use a bi-specific or tandem binder to approach this problem, we believe that including two, or more, full CAR or TCR molecules has the potential to be a more effective approach.
 
Allogeneic CAR-T
The following table summarizes our current CAR-T product candidate portfolio:
 
Our fully allogeneic CAR-T product candidates are developed using well-characterized cells derived from a healthy donor as starting material with the goal of enabling treatment of potentially hundreds of patients from a single manufacturing run. Doses are cryopreserved and stored at treatment centers for future off-the-shelf use.
 P-MUC1C-ALLO1: Multiple Solid Tumor Indications
Overview
 P-MUC1C-ALLO1 is a fully allogeneic CAR-T product candidate with the potential to treat a wide range of solid tumor indications. The target, MUC1-C, is a tumor selective, aberrantly glycosylated, cleavage product of MUC1, that is highly expressed on most epithelial tumors. We designed P-MUC1C-ALLO1 to leverage the
learnings of our P-BCMA-ALLO1 and P-PSMA-101 programs. We are currently evaluating P-MUC1C-ALLO1 in a Phase 1 clinical trial and shared an initial early clinical data update on the program at the European Society for Medical Oncology Immuno-Oncology 2022 Annual Congress, or ESMO I-O, in December 2022. We anticipate a clinical data update on this program at a medical meeting in 2023.
 We used our proprietary piggyBac DNA Delivery System to manufacture a highly purified P-MUC1C-ALLO1 product candidate containing a high percentage of TSCM cells that we believe may be the key to developing a CAR-T therapy to treat solid tumors. We use our proprietary Cas-CLOVER platform to genetically engineer T cells in order to reduce or eliminate both GvHD and host versus graft alloreactivity.
 Target Indication
We intend to further evaluate and later determine clinical indications for initial development of P-MUC1C-ALLO1 in indications where MUC1-C expression occurs. Approximately 90% of cancers derive from epithelial tissues, and among these cancers a significant percentage express MUC1-C, including common cancers such as breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic and renal cancers.
Clinical Development Strategy
We are currently evaluating P-MUC1C-ALLO1 in a Phase 1 clinical trial. P-MUC1C-ALLO1 was designed to leverage the learnings of our other programs. The current Phase 1 protocol allows for enrollment of up to 100 adult subjects with advanced or metastatic epithelial-derived cancers measurable by RECIST and refractory to or ineligible for standard of care therapy. Patients may be enrolled across four arms of single and multiple (cyclic) administrations using two different lymphodepletion regimens of up to five dose escalation cohorts each, using a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Enrollment will begin in cohorts with a standard 3-day cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion regimen given prior to cell infusion followed by cohorts adding rituximab to the lymphodepletion regimen to reduce the appearance of anti-CAR antibodies and potentially improve persistence. Planned dose escalation in each arm range from 0.75 to 15 x 106 cells/kg. Treated patients will undergo serial measurements of safety, tolerability, and tumor response and will be followed for up to 15 years after the last dose of P-MUC1C-ALLO1.
 The primary objectives for this Phase 1 clinical trial include defining the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, evaluation of overall safety and tolerability, and preliminary efficacy and disease response. Additional exploratory
endpoints will include assessing tumor expression of MUC1-C and correlation to response and expansion kinetics of P-MUC1-ALLO1.
 In December 2022, we announced initial early clinical data at ESMO-IO. As of the cutoff date of November 14, 2022, the study had dosed seven patients with epithelial-derived cancers, including esophageal, colorectal, breast, pancreatic and prostate carcinomas, of which four were evaluable for response. Only one patient with breast cancer has been dosed to date; this patient, who has HR+, HER2- breast cancer, with four prior lines of treatment, achieved a partial response at a dose of 0.75x106 cells/kg. Two other patients with heavily pretreated gastrointestinal tumors (colorectal and pancreatic cancer) achieved stable disease at a dose of 0.75x106 cells/kg and 2x106 cells/kg each. Based on such initial early clinical data, P-MUC1C-ALLO1 was safe and well tolerated, with no DLTs, CRS, GVHD or ICANS.
 P-PSMA-ALLO1: Metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer
 Overview
 P-PSMA-ALLO1 is a fully allogeneic preclinical CAR-T product candidate being developed to treat mCRPC. P-PSMA-ALLO1 is being developed using the learnings of our autologous version of the program, P-PSMA-101, which was evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial, in which 38 patients were dosed and initial clinical findings were presented at ASCO-GU in February 2022.
 P-PSMA-ALLO1 targets cells that express PSMA, which is highly expressed on mCRPC cells. PSMA is involved in folate uptake and is thought to confer a proliferative advantage to PSMA-expressing tumor cells. Additionally, PSMA levels increase as tumor cells become androgen-independent, a hallmark of advancing prostate disease. Therefore, we believe that PSMA may be less susceptible to antigen escape.
 Target Indication
 Prostate cancer is the fourth most common cancer globally and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States, with about a 60% occurrence rate in men over the age of 65. In the United States alone, there are approximately 3.1 million men living with prostate cancer, with approximately 40,000 new cases of mCRPC estimated each year. The majority of prostate cancer patient deaths in the United States are due to mCRPC.
 Treatment paradigms for prostate cancer vary based on the patient age and other underlying health conditions at the time of diagnosis. Treatment options for early prostate cancer range from active surveillance, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, hormone therapy and surgical treatment. Patients with metastatic disease receive medicines such as leuprolide to stop testosterone production. The paradigm for patients with metastatic disease further bifurcates between hormone sensitive disease and castrate resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. CRPC cases are generally treated with testosterone blockers such as enzalutamide, darolutamide or apalutamide; abiraterone; chemotherapy drugs such as docetaxel or cabaziltaxel; Radium-223; Lutetium Lu 177; immunotherapy such as Sipuleucel-T and PARP inhibitors such as olaparib or rucaparib. However, CRPC remains a deadly disease and new therapies are needed.
Although five-year survival rates for patients with early prostate cancer are nearly 100%, a high unmet need for mCRPC remains, with a five-year survival rate of only approximately 30%. We believe P-PSMA-ALLO1, if successful in the clinic and approved, could dramatically increase survival, as well as quality of life for mCRPC patients.
 P-BCMA-ALLO1: Multiple Myeloma
Overview
P-BCMA-ALLO1 is a fully allogeneic CAR-T product candidate being developed to treat multiple myeloma in partnership with Roche. We are currently evaluating P-BCMA-ALLO1 in a Phase 1 clinical trial and we presented initial data from our Phase 1 clinical trial at the ESMO I-O Annual Congress in December 2022. We anticipate a clinical data update on this program at a medical meeting in 2023, subject to clearance with Roche.

P-BCMA-ALLO1 is our first fully allogeneic CAR-T product candidate derived from healthy donor cells, giving it the potential to be used as an off-the-shelf therapy for unrelated multiple myeloma patients. We believe our technology and manufacturing processes are ideally suited to develop allogeneic CAR-T product candidates with reduced alloreactivity and without unwanted mutations. We use our proprietary Cas-CLOVER gene editing tool to genetically engineer T cells in order to reduce or eliminate both GvHD and host-vs-graft alloreactivity. Cas-CLOVER is designed to efficiently edit resting T cells and has demonstrated precise specificity, thereby limiting unwanted off-target mutations and helping to improve tolerability. P-BCMA-ALLO1 also includes a single chain VH BCMA binder that we believe based on preclinical data is better than the binder that was part of our P-BCMA-101 program.
 Target Indication
 Multiple myeloma is a deadly form of blood cancer that develops from abnormal plasma cells, a type of immune cell that is typically responsible for secreting antibodies to fight infection. The underlying cause of multiple myeloma is unknown, but it affects patients by creating abnormal plasma cells that secrete high levels of antibodies, or fragments of antibodies, resulting in kidney and other organ malfunction that is ultimately fatal. It can also cause overproduction of abnormal plasma cells in the blood and tumor masses called plasmacytomas in the bone marrow or soft tissue.
 There are approximately 160,000 patients suffering from multiple myeloma in the United States, with nearly 35,000 new cases and nearly 13,000 deaths from the disease annually. It occurs more commonly in men than in women, typically affecting older adults, with the average age of diagnosis of approximately 70 years. Although several new drugs have been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, it remains an incurable disease for most patients. The current treatment paradigm in multiple myeloma begins with proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and autologous stem cell transplants. The great majority of patients become refractory to these drugs and/or relapse, creating a high unmet need for treatments for relapsed/refractory patients. After failing proteasome inhibitors and IMiDs, patients are typically treated with monoclonal antibodies, different PIs and IMiDs or Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CAR-T). Most patients eventually move to palliative care. Without treatment, most multiple myeloma patients die within the first year after diagnosis. Approximately half of those treated under the current regimens survive for five years after diagnosis. We believe P-BCMA-ALLO1, if successful in the clinic, can dramatically increase survival, as well as quality of life for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients.
 Clinical Development Strategy
 The primary objectives of the Phase 1 clinical trial are to evaluate safety and any dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, and determine the MTD of a single-dose infusion of P-BCMA-ALLO1 in adult patients with multiple myeloma who are relapsed and/or refractory to conventional therapy. In addition, we are assessing anti-myeloma response activity using the International Myeloma Working Group, or IMWG, criteria.
 We are initially focused on enrolling patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an IMiD, and anti-CD38 therapy, and/or who are refractory to a proteasome inhibitor, an IMiD, and anti-CD38 therapy.
 The trial is an open-label dose escalation trial enrolling up to 40 patients. The current protocol allows for enrollment of up to 40 adult subjects in up to five dose escalation cohorts each, using a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design. Before administering the P-BCMA-ALLO1 product candidate, subjects receive a conditioning lymphodepletion chemotherapy regimen. The regimen will be 300 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide and 30 mg/m2 of fludarabine intravenously daily for three consecutive days, followed in two days by a single infusion of P-BCMA-ALLO1.
 In December 2022, we announced initial clinical data at ESMO-IO. As of the November 11, 2022 data cutoff, the study had dosed 10 patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma. Of these 10 patients, six are evaluable for response (all at the lowest dose level of 0.75 x 106 cells/kg). The response evaluable patients were heavily pre-treated, having received an average of 6.5 prior lines of therapy with a median time since diagnosis of 5 years. Three patients had previously received BCMA-targeted therapy and four patients had high-risk cytogenetics.
As of the cutoff date, P-BCMA-ALLO1 achieved a 50% (3/6) overall response rate, with a 66% (2/3) ORR in patients who had previously received BCMA-targeted therapy and a 50% (2/4) ORR in patients with high-risk cytogenetics. Of the three responders in the first cohort (0.75 x 106 cells/kg), two patients were partial responses and one patient achieved a very good partial response. P-BCMA-ALLO1 was well tolerated. There were no cases of CRS, GVHD or ICANS. No DLTs were observed. There was one case of febrile neutropenia.
 P-CD19CD20-ALLO1: B-Cell Malignancies
 Overview
 P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf CAR-T product candidate in preclinical development for B cell leukemia and lymphoma indications, in partnership with Roche. P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 contains two fully functional CAR molecules to target cells that express either CD19 or CD20. We believe that by targeting both CD19 and CD20, we have the potential to overcome some of the issues of earlier generation CD19 CAR-T products where antigen escape has been observed.
Clinical Development Strategy
 We anticipate an IND filing and initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial for P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 in mid-2023. The trial will be an open-label dose escalation trial enrolling up to 70 patients.
 P-BCMACD19-ALLO1. P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 is an allogeneic, off-the-shelf CAR-T product candidate in preclinical development for multiple myeloma. P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 contains two fully functional CAR molecules to target cells that express either BCMA or CD19. Based on published studies of CD19 therapeutic candidates in multiple myeloma patients, we believe that targeting both BCMA and CD19 may be more effective than targeting BCMA alone in some patients because it has been hypothesized that there could be myeloma stem cells that express CD19 but do not express BCMA. In addition, including CD19 may prevent anti-drug antibody responses that could shorten the effectiveness of a BCMA-only therapy in some patients. We are developing this product candidate to be fully allogeneic by applying our learnings from the P-BCMA-ALLO1 program. We anticipate an IND filing after analyzing preliminary results observed in the P-BCMA-ALLO1 Phase 1 clinical trial. Roche holds an exclusive option to acquire a license to this program.
Additional Allogeneic Programs
 We have strategically designed our initial and upcoming clinical programs in order to best utilize the findings from our early studies to inform further pipeline development. We have several preclinical programs intended to represent second or third generation programs for our various targets, and are exploring additional indications utilizing different capabilities of our platform.
Liver Directed Gene Therapy
 The concept of in vivo gene therapy arose during the early 1970’s, with initial human testing beginning in 1980. However, early clinical failures held back the development of the field and associated funding and progress was slow until the last decade. Within the last decade, gene therapy has expanded and gained more acceptance. Due to some clinical successes and associated funding and merger and acquisition activity, the field is now emerging as a major focus of new therapeutic development. Despite this re-emergence of interest and development, much of the in vivo gene therapy work faces significant challenges.
 Among the primary limitations of most current gene therapies are the fact that these therapies are generally transient in nature and, therefore, limited to a narrow range of indications. These limitations are driven by a number of factors associated with using AAV as the standard method of delivering the therapeutic transgene. First, specific AAV capsids can be used to effectively infect a number of cell types in vivo, but AAV does not generally integrate into the genome without the virus’ rep gene, which is removed in gene therapy applications to accommodate the therapeutic transgene. The lack of integration results in low expression levels of the therapeutic transgene that generally decrease over time. As cells divide, expression is eventually lost, thus making it difficult or impossible to use AAV-mediated gene therapies in rapidly dividing tissues, such as the pediatric liver. Unfortunately, the pediatric
liver is the tissue that needs to be targeted in order to treat many monogenetic inborn errors of metabolism, particularly in the majority of patients that are more severely affected. Second, AAV has a relatively small cargo capacity, which can limit its ability to treat indications where a larger therapeutic transgene is needed to correct the underlying disease. The relatively small cargo capacity also limits the inclusion of additional features, such as larger tissue-specific promoters, insulators or safety switches. Third, AAV itself can be immunogenic with pre-existing antibodies in some patients. Furthermore, AAV-based therapies often elicit antibody-based immune reactions, making repeat dosing very challenging. Finally, earlier-generation AAV therapies require relatively high doses of virus to deliver enough of the gene to have a clinical effect, which creates safety issues associated with the AAV itself.
 Our technology is designed to address the shortcomings of other AAV approaches in several important ways. First, by combining our piggyBac technology with AAV, we believe we can create a therapeutic that integrates the therapeutic transgene into the DNA and becomes a stable part of the patient’s DNA, even in rapidly dividing cells. This results in the potential for single-treatment cures, even when treating indications that manifest predominantly in the pediatric liver. Second, piggyBac is highly efficient at integrating into DNA, resulting in stable and high expression levels of therapeutic transgenes even at relatively low doses, which we believe may allow potent activity in indications that are not currently treatable with AAV-only technologies. Furthermore, piggyBac in combination with AAV might be effective at much lower viral doses when compared with AAV-only technologies and would therefore mitigate some of the risk of toxicity due to AAV itself.
 We are also combining our piggyBac technology with our nanoparticle technology to deliver therapeutic transgenes in an effort to eliminate the need for AAV altogether. This would completely avoid virus-related toxicity and also enable delivery of larger genes and repeat dosing, which would further expand the number of indications that could be treated.
 While our technology platforms enable the development of in vivo gene therapies in a wide array of applications, we are focusing our initial efforts on liver-directed gene therapy, where we have promising preclinical data and believe we have a significant competitive advantage over early generation gene therapies. We believe that our technology has the potential to address indications and patient populations that AAV-only technologies will not be able to address. In some cases, we believe that by combining our piggyBac technology with AAV or nanoparticle delivery, we have the potential to transform those transient therapies into single-treatment, lifetime durable responses.
 Any AAV-based system can be converted into a piggyBac-AAV vector by simply adding the piggyBac ITRs, which can be as small as 50 base pairs each, inside of the AAV ITRs (AAV + piggyBac transposon). We expect this vector will perform the same as a standard AAV vector in the absence of the piggyBac transposase, which can be delivered in a second AAV (AAV + piggyBac transposase). When using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter gene as a surrogate for a therapeutic transgene and injecting the AAV + piggyBac transposon (no transposase) into animals, we observed a low level of EGFP expression in the liver of the mouse (lower left panel). Similar to other standard AAV therapies, there was a low expression level due to episomal (non-integrated) AAV and as such, it diminished over time, especially as the cells divided. However, when the AAV + piggyBac transposon was co-injected with the AAV + transposase, we observed a high, stable level of expression in a majority of hepatocytes, as shown in the lower right panel. In this case, the piggyBac transposase pulled the transgene out of the transposon and stably integrated it into the genome. As the cells divided, they replicated the integrated therapeutic transgene so all progeny cells permanently expressed it. This strategy has been used in three separate mouse models of various severe congenital liver genetic diseases: OTCD, citrullinemia Type I and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis Type III, demonstrating the potential for single-treatment cures in each case.

One of the goals for our gene therapy programs is to be able to deliver our gene engineering technologies by nanoparticle to eliminate the need to use AAV due to its limitations. In preclinical work, we are seeing positive results in delivering piggyBac transposon (DNA) and piggyBac transposase (RNA) into animal models, resulting in significant integration and transgene expression in all zones of the liver. The following figure represents an experiment where we co-administered piggyBac transposon (DNA) and piggyBac transposase (RNA) formulated into separate nanoparticles to a juvenile mouse and measured levels of expression of a reporter gene in the liver out to 7 months. These data, while preliminary, potentially represent a significant step forward toward our goal of nanoparticle delivery of piggyBac, which we believe would represent a significant advance compared to traditional gene therapy.

Our Gene Therapy Programs
 Gene Therapy
 The following table summarizes our current gene therapy product candidate portfolio including a representation of programs that we partnered with Takeda in 2022:
 
Our gene therapy product candidates have been developed by utilizing our piggyBac technology together with AAV or our nanoparticle technology to overcome the major limitations of traditional AAV gene therapy. We believe that our approach will result in integration and long-term stable expression at potentially much lower doses than AAV technology alone, thus also conferring cost and tolerability benefits. In one program, we have elected to deploy a fully non-viral delivery technology that does not require any AAV or other viral-based technology. Our eventual goal is to completely replace AAV with our nanoparticle technology, freeing future product development in gene therapy of AAV limitations.
 P-OTC-101
 Overview
 P-OTC-101 is an in vivo liver-directed gene therapy candidate for the treatment of severe, early-onset OTCD, which we believe has the potential to achieve single-treatment, lifetime durable responses. We believe our approach will enable treatment of patients early in life, providing a key advantage over conventional AAV-based gene therapies that are unlikely to be effective in newborns and juveniles. We are evaluating our proprietary piggyBac DNA Delivery System combined with a liver-directed AAV or nanoparticles for the in vivo treatment of OTCD. OTCD is an often fatal or morbid urea cycle disease caused by congenital mutations in the OTC gene with a high unmet medical need.
Target Indication
 OTCD is a rare genetic disorder characterized by complete or partial lack of the enzyme OTC. OTC is an enzyme that plays a role in the breakdown and removal of nitrogen from the body, a process known as the urea cycle. The lack of the OTC enzyme results in excessive accumulation of nitrogen in the form of ammonia (hyperammonemia) in the blood. Excess ammonia, which is a neurotoxin, travels to the central nervous system through the blood, resulting in symptoms of lethargy, vomiting, irritability and, in more severe cases, decreased muscle tone, seizures, enlarged liver, respiratory difficulties and death. A severe form of the disorder affects some infants, typically newly born males. A milder form of the disorder affects some children later in infancy. More severe forms of OTC comprise a high unmet medical need.
Preclinical Data
 In our preclinical studies, the approach of combining piggyBac with AAV and LNPs, demonstrated stable and high-level expression of the therapeutic human OTC transgene in the mouse liver following administration to neonatal OTC-deficient mice. In contrast, mice that were administered a conventional AAV-based gene therapy comprising the same human OTC transgene (without piggyBac-mediated integration) demonstrated negligible
human OTC expression. Mice treated with the piggyBac approach uniformly survived into adulthood, while mice treated with the conventional AAV-based approach died.
 
In a separate study, three unique AAV capsids comprising a piggyBac transposon encoding our human OTC expression cassette were evaluated in a mouse model of OTCD. All three capsids demonstrated sustained human OTC mRNA transcription and corresponding OTC protein activity within the liver following a single treatment. These data suggest that piggyBac can be readily incorporated in a variety of existing, clinically mature AAV capsids. Further, the dramatic increase in OTC activity highlights the potential to lower the dose of piggyBac-OTC compared with standard AAV-alone therapies and the ability to still achieve single-treatment, durable responses, which would have additional cost and tolerability benefits compared to standard AAV therapies.
 
P-FVIII-101
 Overview
 P-FVIII-101 is a liver-directed gene therapy combining piggyBac technology with our nanoparticle delivery technology for the in vivo treatment of Hemophilia A.
 We are using our proprietary piggyBac DNA Delivery System combined with our proprietary nanoparticle technology to deliver a Factor VIII therapeutic transgene. We have elected to deploy our fully non-viral delivery
system in this program, and are not reliant on AAV or other viral-based technologies. This program is included in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, and therefore Takeda is obligated to fund the program and will determine the timeline to IND submission.
 Target Indication
Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in Factor VIII production with a high unmet need. Disease can range in severity from mild to severe and Factor VIII levels are correlated with the severity of the disease.
 Preclinical Data
Our preclinical data demonstrates an ability to correct Factor VIII deficiency to normal levels in a juvenile mouse model using nanoparticle delivery of our P-FVIII-101 potential product candidate. We presented preclinical data from this program at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting in New Orleans in December 2022, which showed that P-FVIII-101 achieved and sustained normalized (>50%) human Factor VIII activity following a single dose and delivered therapeutic Factor VIII activity in mice following single and repeat doses, indicating the potential for dose titration. The data support that with our piggyBac delivery system, the therapeutic transgene expression cassette can be stably integrated into the genome of liver cells and provide consistent and durable therapeutic activity.
 P-PAH-101
 Overview
 P-PAH-101 is a liver-directed gene therapy combining piggyBac technology with our nanoparticle delivery technology for the in vivo treatment of Phenylketonuria, or PKU. We are evaluating our proprietary piggyBac DNA Delivery System combined with a liver-directed AAV and nanoparticles for the in vivo treatment of PKU.
 This program is included in the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, and therefore Takeda is obligated to fund the program and will determine the timeline to IND submission.
 Target Indication
 PKU is a metabolic disorder caused by a defect in the enzyme that normally converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. This causes buildup of phenylalanine, which is toxic to the brain, and leads to reduced pigmentation, as well as poor growth and neurological outcomes. Dietary protein restriction is the standard for care, but requires strict lifelong adherence that can be challenging for many patients, especially older children.
 Preclinical Data
Our preclinical data demonstrates resolution of serum phenylalanine, a key PKU biomarker, to normal levels in a mouse model of classical phenylketonuria. In a separate study, we demonstrated expression of the therapeutic phenylalanine hydroxylase, or PAH transgene throughout the liver following a single treatment in juvenile mice. Our data demonstrate that the ability to maintain the high therapeutic PAH protein expression and broad hepatocyte distribution following treatment early in life is due to the integrating mechanism of our piggyBac platform.
 Additional Takeda funded Programs. In October 2021, we entered into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Takeda a worldwide exclusive license under our piggyBac, Cas-CLOVER, biodegradable DNA and RNA nanoparticle delivery technology and other proprietary genetic engineering platforms to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy products for certain indications, including Hemophilia A. In addition to P-FVIII-101, as part of the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we granted Takeda a license to five additional undisclosed preclinical programs in both liver and HSC-directed indications. We are obligated to lead research activities up to candidate selection, after which Takeda is obligated to assume responsibility for further development, manufacturing and commercialization of each program. Takeda will be responsible for all future development costs and timeline disclosures for these programs as well. Takeda is also
obligated to provide funding for all collaboration program development costs. Takeda also has an option to elect up to two additional programs for a total of eight programs should that option be exercised.
Our Strategy
 Our mission is to develop next generation cell and gene therapeutics with the capacity to cure.
We intend to develop and commercialize novel cell and gene therapy products by using our broad gene engineering platform technologies to treat patients with high unmet medical need across a wide of array of indications. Our current pipeline includes allogeneic CAR-T product candidates for oncology indications and piggyBac + AAV and piggyBac + nanoparticle product candidates as liver-directed gene therapy programs for orphan genetic diseases. We plan to pursue our mission through the following strategies:
 Rapidly develop and commercialize allogeneic CAR-T therapies targeting hematological malignancies. We are developing P-BCMA-ALLO1, a product candidate for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, to address cost and safety limitations of current CAR-T therapies utilized in this indication. Over time, we plan to develop our product candidates in earlier lines of treatment and for other hematological malignancies and will seek to commercialize in community hospital settings, and eventually in outpatient infusion sites. Our approach for P-BCMA-ALLO1 is using the findings from our P-BCMA-101 autologous program, which based on the toxicity profile observed in the Phase 1 clinical trial and following discussions with the FDA allowed us to dose on a fully outpatient basis.
 Leverage the strength and breadth of our platform technologies to develop allogeneic CAR-T therapies in solid tumors. Our platform technology is designed to address the historical CAR-T limitations in treating solid tumors, which result from the lack of product persistence needed to have a clinical impact on these indications. We are advancing P-MUC1C-ALLO1 as a candidate for the treatment of solid tumors, as well will continue to evaluate additional products likely using a combination of CAR and TCR approaches.
 Utilize our platform technologies to pursue liver-directed gene therapy programs. Our lead gene therapy product candidates, P-OTC-101 and P-PAH-101, utilize our piggyBac technology combined with AAV and nanoparticles to target orphan genetic diseases with the goal of developing single-treatment cures. In addition, P-FVIII-101 is being developed with nanoparticle-based delivery of our in vivo gene therapies, replacing the need for AAV technology. We believe that nanoparticle delivery of gene therapy could be a major advancement over AAV delivery by improving tolerability, lowering cost, allowing for re-dosing and addressing indications that AAV will not be able to effectively address, including diseases where correction necessitates delivery of large therapeutic transgenes. We and our current and future collaborators, including Takeda, currently plan to develop, and if approved, commercialize our gene therapy product candidates.
 Utilize our technology and capabilities to develop allogeneic multi-CAR-T products. Our Dual-CAR allogeneic product candidates include P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 for B cell malignancies, P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 for multiple myeloma and an undisclosed Dual CAR for solid tumors. We believe these multi-CAR programs highlight the ability of our piggyBac platform to enable product candidates that other technologies will not be able to achieve easily, if at all. We plan to continue developing multi-CAR product candidates, which we believe could represent a next generation of CAR-T therapies.
 Evaluate strategic partnerships and structures to create value and continue to innovate and develop our platform technologies. Our platform technologies are highly differentiated with the ability to create many product candidates across a wide array of therapeutic modalities and indications. As such, we have executed two key collaborations to expand our reach and create additional value in pursuit of our mission. In October 2021, we signed the Takeda Collaboration Agreement to further expand our gene therapy efforts. In August 2022, we announced the Roche Collaboration Agreement to further develop our allogeneic pipeline within hematological indications. Given the breadth of our technology, we believe there are additional areas in which we could evaluate strategic partnerships.
Partnerships
 Roche
 In August 2022, we announced a partnership with Roche in which they have licensed or optioned our lead hematological indications. Included in the upfront license, Roche licensed P-BCMA-ALLO1 and P-CD19CD20-ALLO1, or each, a Tier 1 program. P-BCMA-ALLO1, is currently in a Phase 1 trial, being developed for patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, using the learnings from our first autologous program P-BCMA-101. P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 is currently a preclinical stage program being developed for the treatment of B-Cell hematological indications, for which we expect an IND filing in the first half of 2023. In addition to the two licensed programs, Roche has an option to license P-CD70-ALLO1 and P-BCMACD19-ALLO1, or each a Tier 2 program. P-CD70-ALLO1 is a preclinical stage program being developed to treat hematological indications. P-BCMACD19-ALLO1, is a preclinical dual target program, being developed to treat multiple myeloma. In addition to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 programs, we entered into a research collaboration, in which Roche has an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize up to six allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy products in hematological indications.
 Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, Roche made an upfront payment to us of $110.0 million. Subject to Roche exercising its Tier 2 Program options, designating Collaboration Programs, and exercising its option for the Licensed Products commercial license and contingent on, among other things, the products from the Tier 1 Programs, optioned Tier 2 Programs and Collaboration Programs achieving specified development, regulatory, and net sales milestone events, we are eligible to receive certain reimbursements, fees and milestone payments, including the near-term fees and milestone payments described above, in the aggregate up to $6.0 billion, comprised of (i) $1.5 billion for the Tier 1 Programs; (ii) $1.1 billion for the Tier 2 Programs, (iii) $2.9 billion for the Collaboration Programs; and (iv) $415.0 million for the Licensed Products. We are further entitled to receive, on a product-by-product basis, tiered royalty payments in the mid-single to low double digits on net sales of products from the Tier 1 Programs, optioned Tier 2 Programs and Collaboration Programs and in the low to mid-single digits for Licensed Products, in each case, subject to certain customary reductions and offsets. Royalties will be payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering such product in such country or ten years from first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 Takeda
 In October 2021, we entered into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to Takeda a worldwide exclusive license under our piggyBac, Cas-CLOVER, biodegradable DNA and RNA nanoparticle delivery technology and other proprietary genetic engineering platforms to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy products for certain indications, including Hemophilia A. We collaborate with Takeda to initially develop up to six in vivo gene therapy programs and Takeda also has an option to add two additional programs to the collaboration. We are obligated to lead research activities up to candidate selection, after which Takeda is obligated to assume responsibility for further development, manufacturing and commercialization of each program.
 Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, Takeda made an upfront payment to us of $45.0 million. Takeda is also obligated to provide funding for all collaboration program development costs including our P-FVIII-101 and P-PAH-101 programs; provided that we are obligated to perform certain platform development activities at our own cost. Timelines for P-FVIII-101, P-PAH-101 and other programs subject to the Takeda Collaboration Agreement will be driven by Takeda. Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible to receive preclinical milestone payments that could potentially exceed $82.5 million in the aggregate if preclinical milestones for all six programs are achieved. We are also eligible to receive future clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of $435.0 million in the aggregate per target, with a total potential deal value over the course of the collaboration of up to $2.7 billion, if milestones for all six programs are achieved and up to $3.6 billion if the milestones related to the two optional programs are also achieved. We are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments on net sales in the mid-single to low double digits, subject to certain standard reductions and offsets. Royalties will be payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering such product in such country, ten years from first commercial sale of such product in such country, or expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country.

Potential Additional Programs and Partnership Opportunities
 While we have leveraged our platform technologies to currently pursue the development of CAR-T and liver-directed gene therapy product candidates, our technologies have broad applicability across a wide array of cell and gene therapeutic modalities and diseases. Beyond the current pipeline, we and our collaborators have preclinical data that illustrate future potential applications of the technology platforms when combined in various ways. We may in the future use these tools to create T cell-based products to address indications beyond oncology, such as autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, allergy-related diseases or even neurodegenerative diseases. CAR-T may also be used as an alternative and non-myeloablative preconditioning regimen for stem cell transplants. Our technologies also work well in other cell types and tissues including induced pluripotent stem cells, natural killer cells, HSCs, B cells, hepatocytes, muscles and many others, which could enable additional approaches for future therapeutics in a variety of indications. Lastly, we could use our Cas-CLOVER technology directly in vivo, similar to the approaches taken by other gene editing companies.
Our Team
 We are led by an experienced management team with an unwavering commitment to developing next generation cell and gene therapeutics with the capacity to cure. Our Chief Executive Officer, Mark J. Gergen, J.D., has over 25 years of experience in healthcare and life science companies and most recently served as our President and Chief Business Officer, until his transition to Chief Executive Officer in February 2022. Prior to joining our company in early 2018, Mr. Gergen was part of the executive management team for a number of successful biotechnology companies, including Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Mirati Therapeutics, and Halozyme Therapeutics. As of December 31, 2022, the management team was supported by 314 employees, 156 of whom hold advanced degrees, including 79 with a Ph.D. and/or M.D. degree, and many with extensive experience in drug discovery and development.
 Our CAR-T Manufacturing Processes
Our CAR-T product candidates consist of healthy donor T cells that have been genetically engineered to express a CAR molecule and other genes. PBMCs are harvested by a standard leukapheresis procedure at the enrolling hospital, with the leukapheresis cells transported to the manufacturing site immediately subsequent to the procedure.
 Manufacturing of CAR-T product candidates includes CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cell isolation via positive selection. This is followed by electroporation delivery of the piggyBac DNA transposon transgene (encoding the CAR molecule gene, the DHFR positive selection gene and the safety switch gene), the Super piggyBac transposase RNA (the enzyme that mobilizes the piggyBac transposon transgene), an mRNA encoding the Cas-CLOVER gene editing system along with guide RNA targeting two different genes involved with allogeneic rejection, as well as an mRNA encoding the booster molecule. After this, CAR-positive T cells are selected via methotrexate, the cells are expanded and then further purified for genetically modified cells.
 The final product is then bagged and cryopreserved. Following product release for administration, cryopreserved product candidates are shipped by courier to the pharmacy or applicable cell therapy facility of the enrolling study center where they are stored until the time of administration.


CAR-T Contract Manufacturing
 We have an internal pilot GMP manufacturing facility in San Diego adjacent to our headquarters to develop and manufacture preclinical materials and clinical supplies for Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. We commenced GMP manufacturing in the third quarter of 2021 and initially used the facility for manufacturing our P-MUC1C-ALLO1 program. We have now added our other product candidates and this is our sole source of clinical manufacturing.
 We have previously worked with a number of third-party contract manufacturers for production of our product candidates. For the manufacturing of P-BCMA-ALLO1 we previously worked with WuXi AppTec, Inc., from which we received clinical supply. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received clearance to manufacture P-BCMA-ALLO1 at our internal pilot plant manufacturing facility and this site will be the future source of product going forward. For our other product candidates, we are evaluating various third-party manufacturers for clinical supply. We also work with a variety of suppliers to provide our manufacturing raw materials and we currently source our media from Stemcell and DNA components from Aldevron. We believe that our relationships with our contract manufacturers and suppliers are good. In the future, we may also build one or more commercial manufacturing facilities for any approved product candidates.
 Commercialization Plans
 We possess global rights to our internal product candidates and discovery programs. We intend to retain significant development and commercialization rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company in marketing products. We plan to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time in the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Competition
The biotechnology industry, and specifically the CAR-T and gene therapy sciences, are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. While we believe that our proprietary approach and scientific expertise in CAR-T and gene therapies provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic and research institutions. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or cost less than any products that we may develop. The key
competitive factors affecting the success of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and cost.
 There are other organizations currently working toward commercializing existing therapies and/or new therapies for our initially selected indications. If these efforts are successful and their product candidates are approved or marketed prior to ours, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption of our product candidates.
 Due to the promising clinical therapeutic effect of CAR-T product candidates in clinical trials, we anticipate direct competition from other organizations developing advanced T cell therapies and other types of oncology therapies. This would include companies in the CAR-T space including: Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Allogene, Inc., Arcellx, Inc., Astellas Pharma, Inc., Autolus Ltd., Bellicum Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bluebird Bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Celgene Corporation, now a Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company), Kite Pharma, Inc. (a Gilead Sciences, Inc. company), Legend Biotech Corporation, Novartis AG and Takeda.
 Immunotherapy and gene therapy approaches are further being pursued by several smaller biotechnology companies as well as larger pharmaceutical companies. We also face competition from non-cell-based treatments offered by companies such as Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, F. Hoffman-La Roche AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Inc. and Pfizer Inc. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and/or greater expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing and conducting clinical trials.
 Recent approvals and M&A activity have also spurred the creation of many companies now pursuing gene therapy technologies and indications. The landscape is evolving rapidly and these companies are too numerous to list, but would include companies such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Astellas, Beam Therapeutics, Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bluebird Bio, Cellectis, CRISPR Therapeutics, AG, Editas Medicines, Inc., F. Hoffman-La Roche AG (acquired Spark Therapeutics, Inc.), Generation Bio, Inc., Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., LogicBio Therapeutics, Inc, Moderna, Inc., Novartis AG (acquired AveXis, Inc.), Passage Bio, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and Ultragenyx, Inc.
 In addition, smaller or early-stage companies may compete with us through collaborative arrangements with more established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these enterprises. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries are prevalent and may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials.
 Intellectual Property
 Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally, acquired or licensed from third parties. We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, inclusion in expedited development and review, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
 Our intellectual property estate is designed to provide multiple layers of protection, including: (1) patent rights with claims directed to platform technologies; (2) patent rights with claims directed to core components used in our products; (3) patent rights covering specific products; (4) patent rights covering methods of treatment for therapeutic indications; (5) patent rights covering methods of use for core components and platform technologies; and (6) patent rights covering innovative manufacturing processes. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.

We believe our current layered patent estate, together with our efforts to develop and patent next generation technologies, provides us with substantial intellectual property protection.
 We have filed or will file for patent protection in the United States and internationally for P-MUC1C-ALLO1, P-PSMA-ALLO1, P-BCMA-ALLO1, and our Dual CAR product candidates, our cell therapy candidates and for P-OTC-101, P-FVIII-101, and P-PAH-101, our gene therapy product candidates. However, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in biotechnology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties.
 With respect to the platform technologies and core components described above (e.g., TSCM compositions and manufacturing method, genetically-modified HSC manufacturing method, inducible safety switch, piggyBac DNA Delivery System, Cas-CLOVER gene editing technology, booster molecules for enhanced immune cell expansion, armoring strategies, and nanoparticle delivery methods) the intellectual property estate is comprised predominantly of company-owned or company-acquired intellectual property. We expect to file additional patent applications in support of current and new product candidates as well as new platform and core technologies. Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our current and future product candidates and the methods used to develop and manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and operating without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products depends on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our product candidates, discovery programs and processes. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent or delays on the part of a patentee. In the United States, the patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 In some instances, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and to delay prosecution costs, which may be useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.

We file U.S. non-provisional applications and Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application, and to designate all of the 152 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications. At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing.
 For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending and issued patent claims to ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes, and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.
 We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention, and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future product candidates or for our technology platform. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 In addition to patent protection, we also rely on trademark registration, trade secrets, know how, other proprietary information and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Our agreements with employees also provide that all inventions conceived by the employee in the course of employment with us or from the employee’s use of our confidential information are our exclusive property. However, such confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements can be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting trade secrets, know-how and inventions. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the
proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our products or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or our failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights required to develop or commercialize our future products may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 When available to expand market exclusivity, our strategy is to obtain, or license additional intellectual property related to current or contemplated development platforms, core elements of technology and/or product candidates.

Collaboration Agreements
 Roche Collaboration Agreement
 In July 2022, we entered into the Roche Collaboration Agreement with Roche, pursuant to which we granted to Roche: (i) an exclusive, worldwide license under certain of our intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy products from each of our existing P-BCMA-ALLO1 and P-CD19CD20-ALLO1 programs, or each, a Tier 1 Program; (ii) an exclusive option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide license under certain of our intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy products from our existing P-BCMACD19-ALLO1 and P-CD70-ALLO1 programs, or each, a Tier 2 Program; (iii) an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize allogeneic CAR-T cell therapy products from the up to six Collaboration Programs, as defined below, designated by Roche; (iv) an option for a non-exclusive, commercial license under certain limited intellectual property to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain Roche proprietary cell therapy products for up to three solid tumor targets to be identified by Roche, or Licensed Products; and (v) the right of first offer for two of our early-stage existing programs within hematologic malignancies.
 For each Tier 1 Program, we will perform development activities through a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial, and Roche is obligated to reimburse a specified percentage of certain costs incurred by us in our performance of such activities, up to a specified reimbursement cap for each Tier 1 Program. For each Tier 2 Program, we will perform research and development activities either through selection of a development candidate for IND-enabling studies or, subject to Roche’s election and payment of an option maintenance fee, through completion of a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial. In addition, for each Tier 2 Program for which Roche exercises its option for an exclusive license, Roche is obligated to pay us an option exercise fee. For each Tier 1 Program and Tier 2 Program, we will perform manufacturing activities until the completion of a technology transfer to Roche.
 The parties will conduct an initial two-year research program to explore and preclinically test a specified number of agreed-upon next generation therapeutic concepts relating to allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies. Subject to Roche’s election and payment of a fee, the parties would subsequently conduct a second research program of 18 months under which the parties would explore and preclinically test a specified number of additional agreed-upon next generation therapeutic concepts relating to allogeneic CAR-T therapies. Roche may designate up to six heme malignancy-directed, allogeneic CAR-T programs from the two research programs, for each of which we will perform research and development activities through selection of a development candidate for IND-enabling activities, or each, a Collaboration Program. Upon its designation of each Collaboration Program, Roche is obligated to pay a designation fee. After we complete lead optimization activities for a Collaboration Program, Roche may elect to transition such program to Roche with a payment to us or terminate it. Alternatively, Roche may elect, for a limited number of Collaboration Programs, to have us conduct certain additional development and manufacturing activities through the completion of a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial, in which case Roche will pay certain milestones and reimburse a specified percentage of our costs incurred in connection with such development and manufacturing activities. For each Collaboration Program, we will perform manufacturing activities until the completion of a technology transfer to Roche.
 Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, Roche paid an upfront payment to us of $110.0 million. Subject to Roche exercising its Tier 2 Program options, designating Collaboration Programs, and exercising its option for the Licensed Products commercial license and contingent on, among other things, the products from the Tier 1 Programs, optioned Tier 2 Programs and Collaboration Programs achieving specified development, regulatory, and net sales milestone events, we are eligible to receive certain reimbursements, fees and milestone payments,
including the near-term fees and milestone payments described above, in the aggregate up to $6.0 billion, comprised of (i) $1.5 billion for the Tier 1 Programs; (ii) $1.1 billion for the Tier 2 Programs, (iii) $2.9 billion for the Collaboration Programs; and (iv) $415.0 million for the Licensed Products.
 We are further entitled to receive, on a product-by-product basis, tiered royalty payments in the mid-single to low double digits on net sales of products from the Tier 1 Programs, optioned Tier 2 Programs and Collaboration Programs and in the low to mid-single digits for Licensed Products, in each case, subject to certain customary reductions and offsets. Royalties will be payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering such product in such country or ten years from first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 The Roche Collaboration Agreement became effective in September 2022 upon the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and will continue on a product-by-product and country-to-country basis until there is no remaining royalty or other payment obligations. The Roche Collaboration Agreement includes standard termination provisions, including for material breach or insolvency and for Roche’s convenience. Certain of these termination rights can be exercised with respect to a particular product or license, as well as with respect to the entire Roche Collaboration Agreement.
 Takeda Collaboration Agreement
 On October 11, 2021, we entered into the Takeda Collaboration Agreement with Takeda pursuant to which we granted to Takeda a worldwide exclusive license under our piggyBac, Cas-CLOVER, biodegradable DNA and RNA nanoparticle delivery technology and other proprietary genetic engineering platforms to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy products for certain indications, including Hemophilia A. The parties will collaborate to initially develop up to six in vivo gene therapy programs and Takeda also has an option to add two additional programs to the collaboration. We are obligated to lead research activities up to candidate selection, after which Takeda is obligated to assume responsibility for further development and commercialization of each program.
 Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment from Takeda of $45.0 million. Takeda is also obligated to provide funding for all collaboration program development costs; provided that we are obligated to perform certain platform development activities at its own cost. Under the Takeda Collaboration Agreement, we are eligible to receive preclinical milestone payments that could potentially exceed $82.5 million in the aggregate if preclinical milestones for all six programs are achieved. We are also eligible to receive future clinical development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of $435.0 million in the aggregate per target, with a total potential deal value over the course of the collaboration of up to $2.7 billion, if milestones for all six programs are achieved and up to $3.6 billion if the milestones related to the two optional programs are also achieved. We are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments on net sales in the mid-single to low double digits, subject to certain standard reductions and offsets. Royalties will be payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering such product in such country, ten years from first commercial sale of such product in such country, or expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country.
 Either party may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement in the event of an uncured material breach of the other party, in the case of insolvency of the other party or in the event the other party makes certain challenges to the patents of such party. Takeda may terminate the Takeda Collaboration Agreement for convenience upon prior written notice or in the event of a safety concern immediately upon written notice.
 In-License Agreements
April 2017 Commercial License Agreement with TeneoBio, Inc. (a subsidiary of Amgen Inc.)
 On April 27, 2017, we entered into a commercial license agreement, or the 2017 TeneoBio Agreement, with TeneoBio, Inc., or TeneoBio, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license to use and develop pharmaceutical products comprising allogeneic T-cells expressing a CAR molecule containing certain heavy-chain-only sequences provided by TeneoBio (a CAR containing a non-naturally occurring heavy-chain-only
antibody fragment) for the treatment of human disease. We utilize these license rights in our P-BCMA-ALLO1 product candidate.
 Pursuant to the 2017 TeneoBio Agreement, we have paid TeneoBio $0.5 million through our selection of the antibodies licensed under the 2017 TeneoBio Agreement. We are required to pay TeneoBio up to an aggregate of $20.5 million upon the first achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for any allogeneic product and up to an aggregate of $20.5 million upon the first achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for any autologous product. We are also obligated to pay, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, a royalty in the low single-digit percentage on net sales of all licensed products.
 The 2017 TeneoBio Agreement will terminate on the last to expire valid claim of the licensed patents in all countries. We may also terminate the 2017 TeneoBio Agreement at any time upon 60 days prior written notice to TeneoBio.

 October 2019 License Agreement with Xyone Therapeutics, Inc. (a successor-in-interest to Genus Oncology, LLC)
On October 24, 2019, we entered into a license agreement, or the Xyone Agreement, with Xyone Therapeutics, or Xyone. Pursuant to the Xyone Agreement, we paid Xyone an upfront fee of $1.5 million and Xyone granted us the option, which was exercised for an additional $1.5 million in April 2020, to obtain an exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license under certain patents and a non-exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license under certain know-how controlled by Xyone to research, develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products incorporating CAR cells expressing antibodies and derivatives thereof targeting MUC1, or a Xyone licensed product, and a non-exclusive, sublicenseable, worldwide license under certain patents and know-how controlled by Xyone to research, develop and commercialize companion diagnostics for the treatment, prevention and palliation of human diseases and conditions. The licenses granted pursuant to the Xyone Agreement are subject to certain rights retained by an upstream licensor and the rights of the U.S. government. The retained rights of the upstream licensor pertain only to the ability of the upstream licensor to conduct teaching, education and other non-commercial research activities in the licensed field and for other academic, governmental or not-for-profit organizations to conduct non-commercial research activities in the licensed field, and do not limit our ability to pursue our programs and product candidates. We use a Xyone antibody or derivative thereof targeting MUC1 as a binder in our P-MUC1C-ALLO1 product candidate. Multiple other aspects of our P-MUC1C-ALLO1 product candidate are covered by other patents and intellectual property that we own or license and are not subject to rights of the U.S. government.

Pursuant to the Xyone Agreement, we are also required to pay Xyone up to an aggregate of $71.0 million upon first achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and sales milestones for any Xyone licensed product and companion diagnostics. We are also obligated to pay, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered royalties in the low to mid-single-digit percentage on net sales of any Xyone licensed products and related companion diagnostics, subject to certain customary reductions.
 The Xyone Agreement will expire on the last to expire royalty term, which is determined on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, and is the later of (1) the last to expire valid claim within the licensed patents covering the Xyone licensed product in the country, (2) expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the Xyone licensed product in the country and (3) 10 years from the first commercial sale of the Xyone licensed product in the country. We may also terminate the Xyone Agreement at any time upon 30 days prior written notice to Xyone. Either party may terminate the Xyone license agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within 90 days after receiving written notice of the breach. Xyone also has the right to terminate the Xyone Agreement immediately upon our bankruptcy or if we fail to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for a Xyone licensed product within 20 months after approval of an IND submitted for such Xyone licensed product.
 Amended and Restated License Agreement with HMGU
On March 12, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated patent license agreement, or the HMGU License Agreement, with Helmholtz-Zentrum München—Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Gesundheit und Umwelt GmbH, or HMGU, pursuant to which we obtained exclusive worldwide rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products and services claimed by certain patent applications and patents owned by HMGU covering the nuclease Clo051 in certain fields of use, including human pharmaceutical products. We utilize these license rights in our Cas-CLOVER gene editing technology including P-BCMA-ALLO1, P-MUC1C-ALLLO1 and our other planned allogeneic programs.
 Pursuant to the HMGU License Agreement, we paid HMGU an upfront fee of $11,506, equal to €10,000 on the date of payment. We are required to pay HMGU annual maintenance fees credited against royalties due for the same year. We are also required to pay HMGU up to an aggregate of €1.7 million upon the first achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for the first licensed product where Clo051 is part of the therapeutic agent and up to an aggregate of €0.9 million upon the first of certain clinical and regulatory milestones for the first licensed product where Clo051 is not part of the therapeutic agent. We are obligated to pay, on a licensed product-by-licensed product or licensed service-by-licensed service and country-by-country basis, royalties in the low single-digit percentage range on annual net sales, with the royalty rates varying depending on whether the licensed products are therapeutics or the licensed services are for therapeutic use and whether Clo051 is part of the therapeutic agent or used to generate the therapeutic agent. We currently use Clo051 as part of our gene engineering technology to generate our product candidates.
 The HMGU License Agreement will terminate on the last to expire royalty term, which is determined on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis. We also have the right to terminate the HMGU License Agreement upon giving written notice within 3 months prior to the end of a calendar year. Either party may terminate the HMGU License Agreement upon a material breach by the other party that is not cured within six weeks after receiving written notice of the breach. The HMGU License Agreement terminates automatically if we become bankrupt.
 Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.

The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices regulation;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each treatment site before the trial is commenced;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
 •preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 Preclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial. In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to the FDA’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations, and oversight at the local level as set forth in the NIH Guidelines. Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for
each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
 •Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 •Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee.
 Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things,
whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more treatment sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment
effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. For products containing new molecular entities, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
 Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
In 2017, FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation is intended to fulfill the 21st Century Cures Act requirement that FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (1) it qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. Like breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation provides potential benefits that include more frequent meetings with FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence such as electronic health records; through the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or through post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which
means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
 A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
 •consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 •mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 •the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or
CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the Department of Justice, or the DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers and purchasers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices, including our arrangements with physicians, may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor.
 Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA.
 The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. For instance, historically, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.
 HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, and health plans, known as covered entities, and independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity, known as a business associates, as well as their covered subcontractors. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. It is difficult to predict how Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies will be applied to our products in the future and coverage and reimbursement under different federal healthcare programs are not always consistent. Medicare reimbursement rates may also reflect budgetary constraints placed on the Medicare program.
 Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other health care professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
 In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we
become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
 Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. Similarly, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products.
 Third-party payors decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a therapeutic is:
 •a covered benefit under its health plan;
 •safe, effective and medically necessary;
 •appropriate for the specific patient;
 •cost-effective; and
 •neither experimental nor investigational.
 We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, we cannot be sure that the level of reimbursement will be adequate. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Limited coverage and less than adequate reimbursement may reduce the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our product on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among third-party payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.
 Certain of our products, once approved, may be administered by a physician. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare through Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B is part of original Medicare, the federal health care program
that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement for a manufacturer’s eligible drugs or biologicals, the manufacturer is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program.
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 For example, the ACA has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:
 •an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs that began in 2011;
 •an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer
 •price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the average manufacturer price;

•a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 70% starting on January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
 •extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
 •expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
 •expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
 •a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
 •expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;

 There have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. President Trump signed several executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted which repeals, effective January 1, 2019, the tax penalty for an individual’s failure to maintain ACA-mandated health insurance, commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act’s mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.”
On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the BBA, and the CARES Act will stay in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. The expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program, under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, could also impact our business.
 Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the Trump administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored National model, on December 27, 2021 CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. In addition, Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Further, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
