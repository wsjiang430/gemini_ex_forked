ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Star Equity Holdings, Inc. (“Star Equity”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”) is a multi-industry diversified holding company with three divisions which include operating businesses in two key industry sectors, Healthcare and Construction. We also have a separate Investments division.
Our Healthcare division, which operates as Digirad Health, Inc. (“Digirad Health”), provides products and services in the area of nuclear medical imaging with a focus on cardiac health. Digirad Health operates across the United States and comprises two lines of business—providing imaging services to healthcare providers using a fleet of our proprietary solid-state gamma cameras, as well as the manufacturing, distribution, and maintenance of our proprietary solid-state gamma cameras.
Our Construction division is made up of three operating businesses: KBS Builders, Inc. (“KBS”), EdgeBuilder, Inc. (“EdgeBuilder”), and Glenbrook Building Supply, Inc. (“Glenbrook”), with the latter two managed together and referred to jointly as “EBGL”. KBS is based in Maine and manufactures modular buildings for installation principally in the New England market. EBGL is based in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area and principally serves the Upper Midwest. Together, the EBGL businesses manufacture and deliver structural wall panels and other engineered wood-based products as well as distribute building materials primarily to professional builder customers.
Our Investments division is an internally funded unit directly supervised by Star Equity management. This entity holds and manages our corporate-owned real estate, which currently includes our three manufacturing facilities in Maine that are leased to KBS, as well as minority investments in several public companies.
Strategy
Star Equity
We believe our diversified, multi-industry holding company structure allows Star Equity management to focus on capital allocation, strategic leadership, mergers and acquisitions, capital markets transactions, investor relations, as well as management of our Investments division. Our structure frees up our operating company management teams to focus on their respective businesses, look for organic and bolt-on growth opportunities, and improve operations with less distraction and administrative burden associated with running a public company.
We continue to explore strategic alternatives to improve our market position and the profitability of our product offerings, generate additional liquidity, and enhance our valuation. We may pursue our goals through organic growth and through strategic alternatives. Some of these alternatives have included, and could continue to include, selective acquisitions of businesses, divestitures of assets or businesses, equity offerings, debt financings, or corporate restructuring.
Operating Businesses
We believe that both of our operating divisions, Healthcare and Construction, are well positioned for growth in large addressable markets. The key elements of our growth strategy include the following:
•Organic growth from our core businesses. We believe that we operate in markets and geographies that will allow us to continue to grow our core businesses, allowing us to benefit from our scale and strengths. We plan to focus our efforts on markets in which we already have a presence in order to leverage the personnel, infrastructure, and brand recognition we have in these areas.
•Introduction of new services. In the Healthcare division, we plan to continue to focus on healthcare solutions-related businesses that deliver necessary assets, services, and logistics directly to the customer site and which leverage our existing customer relationships. We believe that over time we can either purchase or develop new and complementary businesses, and take advantage of our customer loyalty and distribution channels. Additionally, we are exploring new imaging technologies through the recent establishment of a joint venture that is presently conducting research and development in the area of heart imaging. In the Construction division, we will consider opportunities to augment our service offering to better serve our customer base. We have done this in the New England market with our entry into the commercial multi-family segment. Other areas might include logistics, on site installation, and manufacturing of sub-components.
•Acquisition of complementary businesses. We plan to continue to look at complementary businesses that meet our financial criteria for acquisitions to grow our Company. We believe there are many potential small public and private targets that can be acquired over time and integrated into our platform. We will also look at larger, more transformational mergers and acquisitions if we believe the appropriate mix of value, risk, and return is present for our stockholders. The timing of these potential transactions will always depend on market conditions, available capital, and valuation. In general, we want to be “value” buyers, and will not pursue any transaction unless we believe the post-transaction potential value is high for stockholders.
Business Segments
Our reportable segments are based upon our internal organizational structure, the manner in which our operations are managed, the criteria used by our Chief Executive Officer (Chief Operating Decision Maker or "CODM") to evaluate segment performance, the availability of separate financial information, and overall materiality considerations. Prior to 2022, we had four reportable segments: Diagnostic Imaging, Diagnostic Services, Construction, and Investments. Effective as of the first quarter of 2022, we reorganized our financial statements into three reportable segments by combining Diagnostic Imaging and Diagnostic Services into one Healthcare segment. This reflects the manner in which our CODM assesses performance and allocates resources:
•Healthcare
•Construction
•Investments
See Note 15. Segments, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for financial data relating to our segments. 
 During the last two fiscal years, the mix of Healthcare and Construction revenue is summarized as follows:

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021
Healthcare Revenue | 49.0 | % | | 55.0 | %


 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021
Construction Revenue | 51.0 | % | | 45.0 | %

Detailed Description of Our Operating Segments
Healthcare
For physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging, echocardiography, or general ultrasound tests, we provide imaging systems, qualified personnel, radiopharmaceuticals, licensing services, and the logistics required to perform imaging in their own offices, while they retain the right and obligation to bill Medicare, Medicaid, or one of the third-party healthcare insurers directly for those services. While our services are primarily cardiac in nature, we provide imaging services primarily to cardiologists, internal medicine physicians, and family practice doctors who typically enter into annual contracts for a set number of days ranging from once per month to five times per week. We offer a convenient and economically efficient cardiac imaging services program as an alternative to purchasing equipment or outsourcing the procedure to an imaging center. 
In addition, we manufacture and sell our internally developed solid-state gamma cameras and imaging systems, as well as provide field services through camera maintenance contracts. Our imaging systems include nuclear cardiac imaging systems, as well as general purpose nuclear imaging systems. We sell our imaging systems and service contracts to physician offices and hospitals primarily in the United States, although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally. Our imaging systems are sold in both portable and fixed configurations, provide enhanced flexibility and improved patient comfort, fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet, and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician’s office, an outpatient hospital setting, or within multiple departments of a hospital (e.g., emergency and operating rooms).
Diagnostic imaging depictions of the internal anatomy or physiology are generated primarily through non-invasive means. Diagnostic imaging facilitates the early diagnosis of diseases and disorders, often minimizing the scope, cost, and amount of care required and reducing the need for more invasive procedures. Currently, the major types of non-invasive diagnostic imaging technologies available are: ultrasound and nuclear imaging. The most widely used imaging acquisition technology utilizing gamma cameras is Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography, or “SPECT”. All of our current internally-developed cardiac gamma cameras employ SPECT technology.
Construction
Our Construction segment services residential and commercial construction projects via our KBS, EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook brands, through which we manufacture modular housing units, structural wall panels, permanent wood foundation systems, and other engineered wood products, as well as supply general contractors with building materials.
KBS is a Maine-based modular builder that started operations in 2001. Today, KBS manufactures fully custom modular homes. KBS offers products for both multi-family and single-family residential buildings leveraging an in-house engineering team and design expertise. KBS markets its modular homes through a direct sales organization, which consists of inside sales and outside sales teams who work with a network of independent dealers, builders, and contractors primarily in the New England states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont). KBS’s outside sales organization focuses on commercial building projects, and works with developers, architects, owners, and general contractors to establish the scope of work, terms of payment, and general requirements for each project. KBS’s inside sales people focus on a network of independent dealers, builders, and contractors to accurately configure and place orders for mainly single-family residential homes. KBS’s network of independent dealers and contractors do not work with KBS exclusively, although some have KBS model homes on display at their retail centers. KBS’s backlog and pipeline, along with its market initiatives to build more student, workforce, and affordable housing, are expected to position KBS for continued growth, particularly in the multi-family segment.
EdgeBuilder is a manufacturer of structural wall panels, permanent wood foundation systems, and other engineered wood products and conducts its operations in Prescott, Wisconsin. EdgeBuilder markets its engineered structural wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems through direct sales people and a network of builders, contractors, and developers in and around the Minneapolis-Saint Paul region. EdgeBuilder’s direct sales organization is responsible for both residential and commercial projects and works with general contractors, developers, and builders to provide bids and quotes for specific projects. Our marketing efforts include participation in industry trade shows, production of product literature, and sales support tools. These efforts are designed to generate sales leads for our independent builders and dealers, and direct salespeople. 
Glenbrook is a supplier of lumber, windows, doors, cabinets, drywall, roofing, decking, and other building materials to professional builders and conducts its operations in Oakdale, Minnesota with an operational facility in Hudson, Wisconsin. EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook operate as one business with a single management team and we refer to them together as EBGL.
Investments
We hold three real estate assets in our portfolio, all of which we lease to our construction subsidiary, KBS. These include their principal production facility in South Paris, ME. Also, we continue to expand our investment activities and have established minority positions in the equity securities of a small number of publicly traded companies
Our Competitive Strengths
Healthcare Services and Products
Our Healthcare division delivers convenient, effective, and efficient healthcare solutions on an as needed, when needed, and where needed basis through our mobile products and services. Our Healthcare division’s diverse portfolio of mobile healthcare solutions and diagnostic imaging equipment and services provides hospitals, physician practices, and imaging centers throughout the United States access to technology and services necessary to provide patient care in the rapidly changing healthcare environment.
We believe that our competitive strengths are centered around our streamlined and cost-efficient approach to providing healthcare solutions to our customers at the point of need, while providing an array of industry-leading, technologically enabled healthcare imaging services, as described below:
•Broad Portfolio of Imaging Services. We have developed and continue to refine an industry-leading, customer service-focused approach to our customers. We have found our focus in this area is a key factor in acquiring and retaining our service-based customers. We also recruit and maintain highly trained staff for our clinical and repair services, which allows us to provide superior and more efficient services.
•Unique Dual Sales and Service Offering. For the majority of our business, we offer a service-based model to our customers, allowing them to avoid making costly capital and logistical investments required to offer these services internally. Further, we have the ability to sell the underlying capital equipment directly to our customers should their needs change and they desire to provide services on their own with the required capital equipment. This ability to serve our customers in a variety of capacities from selling equipment directly, or providing more flexibility through a service-based model, allows us to serve our customers according to their exact needs as well as the ability to capture both ends of the revenue spectrum.
•Leading Solid-State Technology. Our solid-state gamma cameras utilize proprietary photo detector modules that enable us to build smaller and lighter cameras that are portable with a degree of ruggedness that can withstand the vibration associated with transportation. Our dedicated cardiac imagers require a floor space as small as seven feet by eight feet, can generally be installed without facility renovations, and use standard power. Our portable cameras are ideal for mobile operators or practices desiring to service multiple office locations or imaging facilities.
•Addressable Markets and Revenue Opportunities. Bolstered by advances in medical imaging technology, large and growing global healthcare expenditures, an increasing demand for early disease detection and diagnosis, and an aging population, we believe the vast size of the addressable market and the multitude of imaging procedures and applications in the diagnostic imaging market position us to grow revenue and market share in the coming years.
Construction Services and Products
Our competitive strengths at KBS include our strategic location near the Greater Boston region and our ability to serve all of New England. We have the largest manufacturing capacity in New England with the ability to provide high quality wood-based modules for both single and commercial scale multi-family residential buildings. We also provide significant value through our longstanding engineering and design expertise, with a focus on customization to suit specific project requirements. We continue to develop our expertise and specialized knowledge in highly energy-efficient passive homes, which included the delivery of our first zero-energy modular homes for the affordable housing segment during 2020. Additionally, we believe there is a large opportunity in the commercial-scale multi-family modular segment and we have continued to pursue more of these projects.
At EdgeBuilder, we offer a superior product for commercial scale multi-family projects, focusing on structural wall panels. Our engineering and design capabilities allow us to create a product that is unique to the specific project’s requirements. We also provide value with our vertically integrated in-house delivery capability, which helps us to be cost-competitive. Our production strategy is to utilize automation and the most efficient manufacturing methods and high-quality materials in all EdgeBuilder projects. Through our building products distribution business, we operate a professional lumber yard and showroom and deliver highly personalized service, knowledgeable salespeople, and attention to detail that the larger, big-box chain home stores do not provide.
We expect the offsite construction industry to achieve revenue growth over the next several years driven largely by rising housing demand which can be met via modular construction. We believe our Construction division is well positioned to capitalize on the growing popularity of offsite construction—both modular and panelized— in our two current target markets and the United States as a whole.
Sales
Healthcare
We maintain separate sales organizations that are aligned with each of our business units and operate independently but in cooperation with each other. Diagnostic Services sales focuses its efforts on twelve regional areas where the demand for cardiac imaging is concentrated. Diagnostic Imaging equipment sales has a national focus and targets both hospitals and physician practices. Diagnostic Services and Diagnostic Imaging sales teams work collaboratively to address the full range of customers from smaller practice mobile nuclear cardiac imaging services to selling capital equipment to larger practices and hospitals.
Construction
KBS markets its modular homes products through both outside and inside salespeople. Our inside sales team works primarily with our network of independent dealers who source end customers for single family homes, largely in northern New England. Our outside sales team focuses on commercial scale multi-unit projects through new and established relationships with architects, designers, developers, owners builders, general contractors, consultants, and construction managers throughout New England. Their work involves developing and negotiating the full scope of work for KBS, terms of payment, and general requirements for each project.
EBGL markets its engineered structural wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems through direct sales people to a network of builders, contractors and developers in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area and the Upper Midwest states. EBGL’s direct sales organization is responsible for both residential and commercial projects. Our marketing efforts include participation in industry trade shows, production of product literature, and the use of sales support tools. Our showroom and lumber yard processes orders over the phone and services walk-in traffic, mainly focusing on serving professional builders with our highly experienced in-house sales team.
Competition
Healthcare
The market for selling diagnostic products and services to private medical practices and hospitals is highly competitive. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include acceptance by hospitals and physicians, relationships that we develop with our customers, budget availability for our capital equipment, and requirements for reimbursement, pricing, ease-of-use, reliability, and mobility.
Diagnostic Services. In providing diagnostic imaging services, we compete against many smaller local and regional nuclear and ultrasound providers that may have lower operating costs. The fixed-installation operators often utilize older, used equipment, and the mobile operators may use older Digirad single-head cameras or newer dual-head cameras. We are the only mobile provider with our own exclusive source of triple-head mobile systems. Some competing operators place new or used cameras into physician offices and then provide the staffing, supplies, and other support as an alternative to a Diagnostic Services service contract. In addition, we compete against imaging centers that install fixed nuclear gamma cameras and make them available to referring physicians in their geographic vicinity. In these cases, the physician sends their patients to the imaging center.
Diagnostic Imaging. In selling our imaging systems, we compete against several large medical device manufacturers who offer a full line of imaging cameras for each diagnostic imaging technology, including x-ray, MRI, CT, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, as well as SPECT/CT and PET/CT hybrid imagers. The existing nuclear imaging systems sold by these competitors have been in use for a longer period of time than our internally developed nuclear gamma cameras, and are more widely recognized and used by physicians and hospitals; however, they are generally not solid-state, light-weight, as flexible, or portable. Additionally, certain medical device companies have developed a version of solid-state gamma cameras that may directly compete with our product offerings. Many of the larger multi-modality competitors enjoy significant competitive advantages over us, including greater brand recognition, greater financial and technical resources, established relationships with healthcare professionals, broader distribution networks, more resources for product development, marketing, and sales, and the ability to bundle products to offer discounts.
Construction
The market for construction, including through offsite manufacturing, is highly competitive. 
KBS. KBS is a regional manufacturer of modular housing units with a primary target market in the New England states. Several modular manufacturing competitors are located in these New England states and in nearby Pennsylvania. Some competitors have manufacturing locations in Canada and ship their products to the United States.
EBGL. EBGL is a regional manufacturer of engineered structural wall panels and permanent wood foundation systems and also has a local professional-builder-focused retail distribution business. EBGL’s market is primarily the Upper Midwest states (Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin), though largely concentrated within Minnesota and Wisconsin. Glenbrook Building Supply’s professional building material distribution business competes on a local level against both small, local lumber yards, regional building supply companies, and to a certain degree, the “big box” stores such as Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Menard’s.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements and to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the workday, using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. As discussed herein, Healthcare division intellectual property is currently subject to a security interest under the credit facility with Webster Bank, N.A. (“Webster”). 
Our Construction division’s intellectual property is currently subject to a security interest under the credit facility with eCapital Asset Based Lending Corp., formerly known as Gerber Finance Inc. (“eCapital”). Intellectual property is not a very significant factor in our Construction business.
Patents
In Healthcare, we have developed a patent portfolio that covers our products, components, and processes. We have 9 non-expired United States patents. The patents cover, among other things, aspects of solid-state radiation detectors that make it possible for the Company to provide mobile imaging services, and our scan technology that provides for lower patient doses and more specific cardiac images. Our patents expire between 2024 (U.S. Patent 7,164,130) and 2030 (U.S. Patent 8,362,438). While each of our patents applies to nuclear medicine, many also apply to the construction of area detectors for other types of medical and non-medical imagers and imaging methods.
We do not hold any patents within our Construction business.
Trademarks and Copyrights
Our registered trademark portfolio consists of registrations in the United States for Digirad® and CARDIUS®. The Company has produced proprietary software for Diagnostic Imaging systems including: nSPEED™ 3D-OSEM Reconstruction, SEEQUANTA™ acquisition, and STASYS™ motion correction software. We also license certain software products, and their related copyrights, on a nonexclusive basis from Cedars-Sinai Health System. The license includes updates to the software. The license may be terminated at any time by either party upon notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement. Non-payment to licensor is considered a material breach. The license may also be automatically terminated by licensor if (i) an “event of default” occurs under indebtedness for borrowed money of licensee; (ii) licensee ceases business operations; (iii) licensee dissolves; or (iv) licensee commences bankruptcy proceedings. On May 23, 2018, the parties entered into an amendment to the license agreement to, among other things, extend the term of license through July 1, 2023.
Raw Materials
Healthcare. We and our contract manufacturers use a wide variety of materials, metals, and mechanical and electrical components for production of our nuclear imaging gamma cameras. These materials are primarily purchased from external suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers. Materials are purchased from selected suppliers based on quality assurance, cost effectiveness, and constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Inflation and global commodity supply and demand can ultimately affect pricing of certain of these raw materials. Though we believe we have adequate available sources of raw materials, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the quantity of raw material needed to sustain operations, as well as at a cost-effective price.
Our Healthcare services operations utilize radiopharmaceuticals for our nuclear services. The underlying raw material for creation of the array of doses utilized in nuclear medicine is produced from a total of five main production facilities throughout the world, typically from highly enriched uranium resources. In the fourth quarter of 2022, there was a short term worldwide shortage in the supply of radiopharmaceuticals. As such we experienced some shortages which had a negative impact on our business during the last two months of the year. Notwithstanding this temporary shortage, these resources have been and are expected to continue to produce enough raw materials to address the global market, although global conflict in some uranium-rich countries could reduce supply. There continues to be pressure to utilize low or non-enriched uranium resources to produce the underlying nuclear doses.
Construction. Both KBS and EBGL operate in the wood-based construction market. The primary raw materials used in their production processes include dimensional lumber, mainly spruce-pine-fir (SPF), and sheathing/sheet goods (OSB and plywood). The majority of underlying raw material for both KBS and EBGL are sourced by wholesalers and mills in United States, and we from time to time source from Canada. Both businesses depend on the reliability of the lumber supply chain and are sensitive to varying degrees to wood-based commodity price fluctuations.
Manufacturing
Healthcare. We manufacture our nuclear imaging gamma cameras by employing a strategy that combines using internal manufacturing resources for devices requiring specific expertise due to our proprietary design coupled with qualified contract manufacturers. Mechanical and electronic components of our systems are produced by contract manufacturers, whereas the most complex components, final assembly, and final system performance tests are performed at our facility. All of our suppliers of critical materials, components, and subassemblies undergo supplier qualifications and ongoing quality audits in accordance with our supplier quality process.
We and our contract manufacturers are subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Quality System Regulations, state regulations, and standards set by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. We are currently certified to the EN ISO 13485:2016 quality standard. We have received FDA 510(k) clearance for our complete nuclear imaging camera product line (Cardius® XPO, Cardius® X-ACT, and Ergo™ gamma cameras). In addition, the X-ACT camera utilizes an x-ray technology to provide attenuation correction information for the SPECT reconstruction. We also have received additional FDA clearance of our Ergo™ large-field-of-view General Purpose Imager for use in intraoperative and molecular breast imaging.
Construction. KBS began manufacturing single family homes in 2001 and commercial modular multi-family housing units in 2008. In subsequent years, KBS expanded its product offerings to include a variety of commercial-scale multi-family buildings including apartments, condominiums, townhouses, and dormitories. The structures are built inside our climate-controlled factories and are then transported to the site where they are set, assembled, and secured on the foundation. Electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems are inspected and tested in the factory, prior to transportation to the site, to ensure the modules meet all local building codes and quality requirements. Modular construction has gained increased acceptance and is a preferred method of building by many architects and general contractors. The advantages of modular construction include: modules are constructed in a climate-controlled environment; weather conditions usually do not interrupt or delay construction; the building is protected from weather, reducing the risk of mold or other materials damage due to materials absorbing moisture from rain or snow; reduced site work; improved safety and security; reduced vandalism and attrition; and a significant reduction in overall project time.
EBGL consists of two separate companies (EdgeBuilder and Glenbrook) operating in tandem with a common management team. EdgeBuilder manufactures wall panels and permanent wood foundations (PWF) in a climate-controlled factory, then transports the panels to the construction site via flat-bed trucks. The panels are typically unloaded by crane and erected, or assembled, on site by professional framing contractors. Panelized construction, especially in large-scale, multi-unit projects, is becoming increasingly popular due to the heightened demand for construction labor. Additionally, because the wall panels are constructed in a controlled indoor environment, waste, weather-related delays, and mistakes are minimized. This shaves weeks off large, multi-unit construction schedules, leaving room for more annual builds. Glenbrook, as a retailer of professional building products, is not directly involved in manufacturing but does often sell and ship product in tandem with EdgeBuilder wall panel deliveries. As International Building Code® continues to evolve, KBS and EBGL, along with our professional partners in the industry, meet code changes with innovative products and a dedicated staff for adherent builds.
Healthcare Reimbursement
Our Healthcare customers typically rely primarily on the Medicare and Medicaid programs and private payors for reimbursement. As a result, demand for our products and services is dependent in part on the coverage, reimbursement policies, and ability to pay of these payors. Third party coverage and reimbursement is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign regulation, and private payor rules and policies. In many instances, the applicable regulations, policies, and rules have not been definitively interpreted by regulatory authorities or the courts, are open to a variety of interpretations, and are subject to change without notice.
The scope of coverage and payment policies vary among third-party private payors. For example, some payors will not reimburse a provider unless the provider has a contract with the payor, and in many instances such payors will not enter into such contracts without the approval of a third party “radiology benefit manager” that the payor compensates based on reducing the payor’s imaging expense. Other payors prohibit reimbursement unless physicians own or lease our cameras on a full-time basis, or meet certain accreditation or privileging standards. Such payor requirements and limitations can significantly restrict the types of business models we can successfully utilize.
Medicare reimbursement rules are subject to annual changes that may affect payment for services that our customers provide. In addition, Congress has passed healthcare reform proposals that are intended to expand the availability of healthcare coverage and reduce the growth in healthcare spending in the United States. Many of these laws affect the services that our customers provide, and could change further over time.
Medicare reimbursement rules impose many standards and policies on the payment of services that our customers provide. For instance, physicians billing for the technical component of nuclear imaging tests must be accredited by a government-approved independent accreditation body and many private payors are adopting similar requirements. We offer our customers a service to assist them in obtaining and maintaining the required accreditation. We believe we have structured our contracts in a manner that allows our customers to seek reimbursement from third-party payors in compliance with Medicare reimbursement rules. Our physician customers typically bill for both the technical and professional components of the tests. Assuming they meet certain requirements including, but not limited to, performing and documenting bona fide interpretations and providing the requisite supervision of the non-physician personnel performing the tests, they may bill and be paid by Medicare. If the failure to comply is deemed to be “knowing” or “willful,” the government could seek to impose fines or penalties, and we may be required to restructure our agreements and/or respond to any resultant claims by such customers or the government. Our hospital customers typically seek reimbursement by Medicare for outpatient services under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System. 
Government Regulation
Healthcare
We and our medical professional customers must comply with an array of federal and state laws and regulations. Violations of such laws and regulations can be punishable by criminal, civil, and/or administrative sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Accordingly, we maintain a vigorous compliance program and a hotline that permits our personnel to report violations anonymously if they wish.
The following is a summary of some of the laws and regulations applicable to our business:
•Anti-Kickback Laws. The Medicare/Medicaid Patient Protection Act of 1987, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “Anti-Kickback Statute”, prohibits us from knowingly and willingly offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any form of remuneration in return for the referral of items or services, or to purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program. Violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony, punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, or both, and can result in civil penalties and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted similar statutes prohibiting payments intended to induce referrals of products or services paid by Medicaid or other nongovernmental third-party payors.
•Physician Self-Referral Laws. Federal regulations commonly referred to as the “Stark Law” prohibit physician referrals of Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity for certain designated health services if the physician or an immediate family member has an indirect or direct financial relationship with the entity, unless a statutory exception applies. We believe that referrals made by our physician customers are eligible to qualify for the “in-office ancillary services” exception to the Stark Law, provided that the services are provided or supervised by the physician or a member of his or her “Group Practice,” as that term is defined under the law, the services are performed in the same building in which the physician regularly practices medicine, and the services are billed by or for the supervising physician or Group Practice. Violations of the Stark Law may lead to the imposition of penalties and fines, the exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and liability under the federal False Claims Act and its whistleblower provisions. Many states have adopted similar statutes prohibiting self-referral arrangements that cover all patients and not just Medicare and Medicaid patients.
•HIPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits schemes to defraud healthcare benefit programs and fraudulent conduct in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services. HIPAA also establishes standards governing electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information. Some states have also enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, enacted February 17, 2009, made significant changes to HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Effective February 17, 2010, we are regulated directly under all of the HIPAA rules protecting the security of electronic individually identifiable health information and many of the rules governing the privacy of such information.
•Medical Device Regulation. The FDA classifies medical devices, such as our cameras, into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with the device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class I or II, which generally requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, are placed in Class III, requiring an approved Premarket Approval Application (“PMA”). Our cameras are Class II medical devices that have been cleared for marketing by the FDA. We are also subject to post-market regulatory requirements relating to our manufacturing process, marketing and sales activities, product performance, and medical device reports should there be deaths and serious injuries associated with our products.
•Pharmaceutical Regulation. Federal and state agencies, including the FDA and state pharmacy boards, regulate the radiopharmaceuticals used in our Diagnostic Services business.
•Radioactive Materials Laws. We must maintain licensure under, and comply with, federal and state radioactive materials laws, or RAM laws. RAM laws require, among other things, that radioactive materials are used by, or that their use be supervised by, individuals with specified training, expertise, and credentials and include specific provisions applicable to the medical use of radioactive materials.
•Environmental Matters. The facilities we operate or manage generate hazardous and medical waste subject to federal and state requirements regarding handling and disposal. We believe that the facilities that we operate and manage are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the handling and disposal of such materials. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material additional amounts in order to remain in compliance with these laws and regulations or that compliance will materially affect our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 413 employees in all our divisions, of which 174 were employed in clinical health-related positions, 106 in manufacturing, 56 in operational roles, 55 in general and administrative functions, and 22 in marketing and sales. All positions are in the United States. We also utilize varying amounts of temporary workers as necessary to fulfill customer requirements. We have policies to prevent discrimination based on gender, race, disability, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. We also take affirmative action to employ and advance veterans in employment. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
Recent History of our Business Transformation
On October 30, 2020, Star Equity entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “DMS Purchase Agreement”) with Knob Creek Acquisition Corp., a Tennessee corporation (“Buyer”), subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. Buyer purchased all of the issued and outstanding common stock of DMS Health Technologies Inc. (“DMS Health”), which operated our Mobile Healthcare business segment, from Project Rendezvous Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “DMS Sale Transaction”). As a result of the entry into the DMS Purchase Agreement, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the Mobile Healthcare business is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as discontinued operations. The purchase price for the DMS Sale Transaction was $18.75 million in cash. After certain adjustments, including a working capital adjustment, we received an immaterial amount of net escrow settlement in January, 2022. 
On February 1, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its MD Office Solutions (“MDOS”) subsidiary to M.D.O.S.C.A Inc., a California based holding company (“MDOSCA”), in exchange for a secured promissory note in the original principal amount of $1.4 million and entry into multi-year service and support agreements between MDOSCA and Digirad Health.
On March 31, 2021, in connection with completing the sale of DMS Health, the Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company, and Sterling entered into a Second Amendment to the Webster Loan Agreement (as defined below) pursuant to which, among other things, Sterling consented to the sale of DMS Health and its subsidiaries, removed DMS Health and its subsidiaries as borrowers under the Webster Loan Agreement, and required the principal to be paid down to $7.0 million. On February 1, 2022, Sterling became part of Webster, and Webster became successor in interest to the Webster Loan Agreement.
On June 2, 2021, our board of directors adopted, and we entered into, a Rights Agreement (the “Rights Agreement”) with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent, designed to preserve the value of our significant U.S. net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) and other tax benefits by deterring transfers of our common stock that could result in an “ownership change” under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“the Code”). In connection with the Rights Agreement, our board of directors declared a dividend to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 14, 2021, for each outstanding share of our common stock, of one right to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a new series of participating preferred stock of our Company at a specified exercise price.
Pursuant to the Rights Agreement, if any person or group acquires 4.99% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without our board of directors’ permission, or if a person or group that already owns 4.99% or more of our common stock acquires additional shares without our board of directors’ permission, then, subject to certain exceptions, there would be a triggering event under the Rights Agreement. The rights would then become exercisable and entitle stockholders (other than the acquiring person or group) to purchase additional shares at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of the acquiring person or group. In its discretion, our board of directors may exempt certain transactions from the provisions of the Rights Agreement, including if our board of directors determines that the transaction will not jeopardize our tax benefits, or the transaction will otherwise serve our best interests. Any stockholder desiring to own 5% or more of our shares, or increase an existing ownership position that is already at or above 5%, can request an exemption from our board of directors by submitting certain basic information to us and following the other instructions included in the Rights Agreement. The Rights Agreement and the rights issued under the Rights Agreement will expire on June 2, 2024, or on an earlier date if certain events occur, as described more fully in the Rights Agreement.
At our Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on October 21, 2021, our stockholders ratified and approved the Rights Agreement and a protective amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation designed to protect the tax benefits of our NOLs. Additional information regarding the Rights Agreement is contained in our Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 22, 2021.
No rights were exercisable at December 31, 2022. There is no impact to financial results as a result of the adoption of the Rights Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2022.
On December 10, 2021, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Jeffrey E. Eberwein, our Executive Chairman, relating to the issuance and sale of 650,000 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $3.25 per share pursuant to a private placement. The transaction was approved by a Special Committee of our board of directors made up of independent directors and by the Audit Committee of our board of directors. The gross proceeds to us from the transaction, before deducting transaction fees and other transaction expenses, were $2.1 million.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a resale registration statement to register under the Securities Act of 1933 the resale by Mr. Eberwein of the shares, which was completed in January 2022. 
On January 24, 2022, we closed an underwritten public offering (the “2022 Public Offering”) pursuant to an underwriting agreement with Maxim Group LLC, as representative of the underwriters. The 2022 Public Offering was for 9,500,000 shares of common stock (or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock in lieu thereof) and warrants to purchase up to 9,500,000 shares of common stock (the “common warrants”). Each share of common stock (or pre-funded warrant in lieu thereof) was sold together with one common warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $1.50 per share and common warrant. Gross proceeds, before deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses and excluding any proceeds we may receive upon exercise of the common warrants, were $14.3 million and net proceeds were $12.7 million.
Effective April 1, 2022, we appointed Richard K. Coleman Jr. as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Coleman was elected to our Board of Directors in May 2022. Mr. Coleman brings extensive CEO leadership and board-level experience to our senior leadership team. In his role as Chief Executive Officer, he oversees our operations, assists our business leaders in achieving their growth and profitability goals and will launch new business initiatives, as well as help analyze and integrate future acquisitions. Mr. Coleman brings more than 30 years of executive leadership experience with extensive expertise in business development, operational excellence, and acquisitions.
