Item 1. Business 
OVERVIEW 



CohBar (“CohBar,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its” or the “Company”) is a clinical stage biotechnology company leveraging the power of the mitochondria and the peptides encoded in its genome to develop potential breakthrough therapeutics targeting chronic and age-related diseases. Our novel approach is built on the key insights of the Company’s founders that certain mitochondrially encoded peptides produce effects that are not limited to local regulation within the mitochondria and may have important roles to play in critical systemic biological pathways. Many of these effects are quite distinct from what has been thought of as energy production and metabolism, involving diverse processes including inflammation, fibrosis and cell signaling.





1







Through our exploration of the mitochondrial genome and its utility for the development of novel therapeutics, we have developed a world-renowned expertise in mitochondrial biology and a broad intellectual property estate with 6 issued patents and approximately 30 pending patent applications. Our proprietary processes of identifying nucleic acid sequences encoding native peptides in the mitochondrial genome, developing and optimizing novel analogs of these natural mitochondrial derived peptides (“MDPs”), as well as developing and conducting proprietary screens to identify and characterize the activities of these peptides are referred to as our technology platform. We are exploring development and/or partnership opportunities within the Company’s peptide library and technology platform.



We believe that the proprietary capabilities of our technology platform, combined with our scientific expertise and intellectual property portfolio, provide a competitive advantage in our mission to treat chronic and age-related diseases through the advancement of a new class of transformative drugs. Our peptide optimization process is designed to discover numerous potential drug candidate opportunities. These drug candidates may be internally developed by CohBar or advanced through strategic partnerships with larger biopharmaceutical companies.



OUR PIPELINE 



Our research efforts have historically been focused on utilizing our technology platform to identify, assess and optimize novel analogs of native peptides found in the mitochondrial genome and advancing those candidates with the greatest therapeutic and commercial potential.



CB4211



Our most advanced clinical candidate, CB4211, is a first-in-class therapeutic for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) and obesity. CB4211 demonstrated positive effects on reducing biomarkers of liver injury and improving metabolic homeostasis in a Phase 1a/1b clinical study in obese subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”). CB4211 is a novel and improved analog of MOTS-c, a naturally occurring MDP. MOTS-c was discovered in 2012 by CohBar founder Dr. Pinchas Cohen and his academic collaborators and has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of metabolism in animal models. Compared to other assets under development for the treatment of NASH, CB4211 has a unique mechanism of action, which we believe offers a differentiated approach to treating NASH and obesity, as well as the potential to exhibit an enhanced safety profile due to its natural origin. Furthermore, we believe the positive clinical data from our CB4211 trial is an important validation of our overall approach to drug discovery, serving as a proof point that novel analogs of peptides encoded in the mitochondrial genome can impact systemic biological pathways in humans.

In August 2021, we released positive topline data from our Phase 1a/1b clinical study of CB4211. The Phase 1a stage of the study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CB4211 following single and multiple-ascending doses in healthy subjects. Subjects in the Phase 1a study experienced mild, but persistent injection site reactions, which were generally seen as painless bumps at the injection site that can be felt under the skin. We modified the formulation for CB4211 partway through the Phase 1a study and did not observe any persistent injection site bumps with the modified formulation. The subsequent Phase 1b stage was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and activity of CB4211 in obese subjects with NAFLD. The study met its primary endpoint as CB4211 was well-tolerated and appeared safe with no serious adverse events. The evaluation of the exploratory endpoints in the Phase 1b portion of the trial showed significant reductions from baseline in key biomarkers of liver damage, ALT and AST, and in glucose levels in the CB4211 group compared to placebo after four weeks of treatment, with a trend towards lower body weight.



We do not believe that the formulation of CB4211 used in the Phase 1b stage of the trial is suitable for further development. Efforts to develop an improved formulation have not been successful to date and there can be no assurances that we will be able to develop such a formulation.



CB5138 Analogs



Our CB5138 Analogs are potential first-in-class therapeutics that have demonstrated significant anti-fibrotic properties in a variety of preclinical models. Recent results suggest that these effects may be mediated through impacts on the Wnt/Frizzled pathway, which is known to play an important role in fibrosis. In 2021, we nominated CB5138-3 as our second clinical candidates based on its efficacy in mouse models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; however, in December 2022, we announced suspension of further Investigational New Drug (“IND”) enabling activities for this peptide due to challenges in identifying a suitable formulation for clinical development. Any future development of other CB5138 Analogs may face similar formulation challenges.
Recent Developments



We have retained Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc. as a financial advisor to assist the Company in exploring strategic alternatives. Potential strategic alternatives that may be explored or evaluated as part of this process include a merger, business combination, investment into the Company, asset sale or other strategic transaction. Our board of directors has not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review, nor has it made any definitive decisions related to taking any further actions or potential strategic options at this time or at all. There can be no assurance that this process will result in any such transaction and the Company does not intend to disclose additional details unless and until it has entered into a specific transaction. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Strategic Alternative Process and Potential Strategic Transaction.”
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES



As of December 31, 2022, we had ten employees, nine full-time and one part-time. Additionally, from time to time we have engaged subject-matter experts on a consulting basis in specific areas of our research and development efforts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.



Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, retaining and incentivizing our existing employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 



Research and development activities have historically been central to our business model. Our research programs have included activities related to discovery of novel MDPs, investigational research to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of certain discovered natural sequences in in vitro and preclinical studies, engineering novel, improved analogs of certain discovered natural sequences with characteristics suitable for further development as potential drug candidates and advancing our identified candidates through clinical studies. Depending on factors of capability, cost, efficiency and intellectual property rights, we have conducted various aspects of our research programs either independently at our laboratory facility or under contractual arrangements with third party contract research organizations (“CROs”).

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY



Patents



Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our novel biological discoveries and therapeutic methods, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, licensing and/or filing patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business.



Our intellectual property and patent strategy is focused on our MDPs and our novel analogs of these natural peptides. Our strategy is generally to seek patent protection in the United States and, where applicable, in those international jurisdictions we identify as holding significant potential market opportunity for any drug we may develop and in which patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. With respect to new biologically active MDPs that we identify within the mitochondrial genome, we typically file provisional patent applications and seek composition-of-matter and method-of-treatment patents for our MDPs, and/or their novel analogs, and prospective novel drug candidates as well as methods of use based on research and preclinical evaluation of therapeutic potential.



As of December 31, 2022, we are the owners of 6 issued patents and approximately 30 pending patent applications, with claims predominantly directed to composition of matter and methods of use of novel MDPs and their novel analogs. Our patent applications include filings in the United States, Europe and a number of other foreign countries, with projected expiration dates ranging from 2037 to 2041. Additionally, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee from the Regents of the University of California (the “Regents”) of 15 issued patents that will expire between 2028 and 2034. However, following the termination of one of our licenses with the Regents on April 6, 2023, the Company will be exclusive licensee of 11 issued patents worldwide.



Terms for individual patents extend for varying periods of time generally depending on the date of filing of the patent application and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period; however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed fourteen years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest international filing date. In certain instances, extension of patent term due to regulatory approval activities is available in foreign countries.



National and international patent laws concerning peptide therapeutics remain highly unsettled. Policies regarding the patent eligibility or breadth of claims allowed in such patents are currently in flux in the United States and other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own, license, or may license or own in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.

Trade Secrets 



In addition to patents, we have relied upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS



Government Regulation 



The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our therapeutic candidates and future products, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and other laws. Biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and related regulations, and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biological products include, among other things, viruses, therapeutic serums, vaccines and most protein products. Product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.



Regulatory approval will be required in all major markets in which we, or our licensees, seek to test any future products. At a minimum, such approval requires evaluation of data relating to quality, safety and efficacy of a product for its proposed use. The specific types of data required and the regulations relating to these data differ depending on the territory, the drug involved, the proposed indication and the stage of development.



In general, new chemical entities are tested in animal models to determine whether the product is reasonably safe for initial human testing. Additional preclinical testing continues during the clinical development stage. Clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase 1 trials typically involve the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical into healthy human volunteers and focus on testing for safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. In the case of serious or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, initial Phase 1 trials are often conducted in patients directly, with preliminary exploration of potential efficacy. Phase 2 trials involve clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular disease indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine appropriate dosages and dose regimens and the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 trials are typically closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. Phase 3 trials are generally expanded, well-controlled clinical trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness, as well as the appropriate dose and dose ranges of the drug, have been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

In the United States, specific research and preclinical data, chemical data and a proposed clinical study protocol, as described above, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which, unless the FDA objects, will become effective 30 days following receipt by the FDA. Phase 1 trials may commence only after the IND application becomes effective. Following completion of Phase 1 trials, further submissions to regulatory authorities are necessary in relation to Phase 2 and 3 trials to update the existing IND. Authorities may require additional data before allowing the trials to commence and could demand discontinuation of studies at any time if there are significant safety issues. In addition to regulatory review, a clinical trial involving human subjects has to be approved by an independent body. The exact composition and responsibilities of this body differ from country to country. In the United States, for example, each clinical trial is conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board for any institution at which the clinical trial is conducted. This board considers among other factors, the design of the clinical trial, ethical factors, the safety of the human subjects and the possible liability risk for the institution.



Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the approval process. Failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product.



In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit a new drug application, or NDA, for review by the FDA. The NDA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning safety and effectiveness of the drug compound from laboratory, animal and clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product stability, and proposed product labeling.



There can be no assurance that if clinical trials are completed that we or any future collaborative partners will submit an NDA or similar applications outside of the United States for required authorizations to manufacture or market potential products, or that any such applications will be reviewed or approved in a timely manner. Approval of an NDA, if granted at all, can take several months to several years, and the approval process can be affected by a number of factors. Additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review and may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. Regulatory authorities may conduct inspections of relevant facilities and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved. Further, inspections may occur over the life of the product. An inspection of the clinical investigation sites by a competent authority may be required as part of the regulatory approval procedure. As a condition of marketing approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor adverse effects, or other additional studies as deemed appropriate. After approval for the initial disease indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect product marketability.
