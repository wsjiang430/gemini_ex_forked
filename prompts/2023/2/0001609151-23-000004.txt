Item 1. Business 
Overview
Weave is a leading all-in-one customer communications and engagement software platform for small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs. We are creating a world where SMB entrepreneurs can utilize state-of-the-art technology to transform how they attract, communicate and engage customers, grow their business and realize their dreams. Our platform enables business owners to maximize the value of their customer interactions and minimize the time and effort spent on manual or mundane tasks by bringing multiple workflows together into an all-in-one platform.
We have democratized powerful communications and engagement capabilities previously only available to enterprises, made them intuitive and easy to use and put them in one place – always within reach of the SMB. Our cloud-based software platform streamlines the day-to-day operations of running a small business. We offer an all-in-one platform spanning all forms of communications and customer engagement ranging from answering phones, to scheduling appointments, to sending text reminders, to requesting client reviews, to collecting payments, to sending email marketing campaigns, to verifying insurance. We bring small businesses and the people they serve closer together by unifying, modernizing and personalizing customer interactions. Our platform helps improve communications, attract more customers, keep customers engaged and increase overall retention.
Our Platform
We help SMBs manage essential customer interactions. Our platform helps improve communications, attract more customers, keep customers engaged and increase overall retention. We consolidate telephony, messaging, scheduling, payments, employee collaboration, digital forms, insurance verification, customer review management and marketing into one simple, easy and elegant solution. We allow SMBs to facilitate and manage customer interactions in a unified, modernized and personalized manner that best fits their customers’ needs and preferences. We set SMBs free to do what they do best: to serve their customers. Before Weave, SMBs were forced to focus much of their time on entering data forms, scheduling, collecting payments, responding to missed calls and finding new customers. Now, we allow them to use their time to focus on their customers, grow revenue, expand profitability and pursue their dreams.
The key benefits of our platform include:
•Easy to Use and Intuitive. Our platform is designed to be simple and intuitive. We democratize enterprise customer communications and engagement capabilities for SMBs, saving them time and allowing them to effectively and efficiently communicate with their customers. 
•Unified Communications and Engagement. We create a comprehensive communications hub by integrating with an SMB’s system of record, whether a practice management system, customer relationship management (“CRM”) or enterprise resource planning software – and other third party applications – and providing a unified platform for answering phones, scheduling appointments, sending text reminders, requesting client reviews, collecting payments and managing email marketing, all in one place.
•Low Total Cost of Ownership and High ROI. Our platform can help our customers reduce cancellations, increase appointments, and increase customer growth. Furthermore, our solution provides greater functionality and costs significantly less than what the combined point solution patchwork would require.
•Purpose-Built for Our Industry Verticals. To maximize the value from our solution, we design our platform and products to address the specific needs of each industry vertical that we target.
•Reduced Churn for Our Customers. Our platform helps businesses keep their customers engaged by interacting with them through their modality of choice, whether by phone, text, email or chat. This results in increased customer loyalty and retention.
•Improved Ability to Attract New Customers. Our platform helps businesses attract new customers more easily by collecting and managing online reviews and eliminating the friction typically associated with scheduling appointments, filling out forms and making payments. 
•Consumer-Driven Communication Modalities. Our platform engages with customers in the manner that is easiest and most comfortable for them.
Our Products
We provide an all-in-one customer communications and engagement platform for SMBs. From the first phone call to the final invoice and every touchpoint in between, we connect the entire customer journey. Our software solutions transform how local businesses attract, communicate with and engage customers to grow their business.
All of our communications features, including text, leverage a single phone number. This means all messages come from the business phone number, so no personal cell phone numbers have to be used and multiple team members can manage conversations.
Customized Phone System. Weave provides a smarter phone system that helps businesses identify whether incoming calls are from new or current customers, provides helpful and actionable information at every call and manages heavy call times. With features such as WeavePop, businesses can instantly see a desktop pop-up display that shows information such as who is calling, who needs an appointment and who has a balance on their account. 
Weave Text Messaging. Our two-way texting function allows businesses to communicate with customers in a way that is easy, simple and accessible. Businesses can send a broad array of communications ranging from birthday messages and appointment reminders to requests to pay overdue balances.
Weave Missed Call Text. With Missed Call Text, businesses can take action in real time upon notification of a missed call. This feature enables businesses to rapidly engage with their customers after hours or when otherwise unavailable by providing an immediate automatic text message asking how their office can help.
Weave Team. Weave provides a modern, secure group messaging solution that helps businesses and their team members communicate with each other from their workstations, allowing for faster collaboration to respond to and delight customers. And if key employees are out of the office, the group messaging function allows them to stay in-the-know on everything going on at the office, wherever they are.
Weave Mobile App. With Weave’s mobile app, offices can text customers, request payments, receive and make calls from their own office number from anywhere through an Android device or iPhone. This provides businesses and their team members flexibility to continue communicating with customers and team members and operating key business functions without having to be in the office.
Weave Reviews. Weave Reviews helps businesses automatically request, collect, monitor and respond to reviews on sites such as Google, Facebook and Yelp. Weave Reviews helps businesses get discovered, rank higher in searches and grow their customer base.
Weave Email Marketing. Weave provides a robust but easy-to-use email system built for non-experts. Businesses can choose from a constantly-expanding library of pre-written email templates and a library of free images, to automatically send updates and promotions to segments of their customer and prospect base.
Text Connect. Weave’s Text Connect enables businesses to interact with their existing and potential customers online directly through their websites. This functionality gives businesses the flexibility to respond when it is convenient for them and their customers and prospects, and enables multiple conversations at once.
Payments. Weave Payments is a comprehensive payment processing solution for businesses that offers multiple contactless payment options, allowing their customers to pay the way they want, whether they are in the office or miles away, and whenever it is most convenient for them. Customers can choose from in-office payments, mobile card payments, manual card entry, retaining a card on file or Text to Pay.
Customer Insights. Weave’s platform centralizes all important information a business needs for each of its customers. The customer profile shows the client's name, birthdate, recent messages/calls, and upcoming appointments to empower the business to take actions faster. Among other things, this allows businesses to collect payments faster, improve personalized engagement with each customer and recommend follow-up items needed for an excellent customer experience.
Digital Forms. Weave’s Digital Forms product simplifies the hassle of collecting patient and customer information. It creates a secure, convenient and modern way for customers to fill out critical information. Also businesses’ customers can submit forms online before coming to their appointment, so businesses can reduce physical contact and lower their operating costs by eliminating a highly manual activity. 
Online Scheduling. Weave’s scheduling product, when integrated with the office’s system of record, allows businesses to send automatic scheduling reminders via text message or email reminders at any time, any date and personalizes each reminder for the customer. This functionality allows businesses to schedule more appointments, reduce no-shows and fill their schedule more efficiently. Businesses can customize by appointment date and time, type of appointment, customer name, day of week they want to send, days or minutes ahead of appointment. In addition, through Weave Online Scheduling customers can set up their own appointments from the business’ website, reducing scheduling phone calls and allowing for flexibility in the business’ response.
Insurance Verification. Weave Insurance Verification helps office staff spend more time creating an exceptional patient experience and less time calling insurers to verify patient coverage details. Within the Weave platform, users can get up-to-date and accurate patient insurance plan details, all with a click of a button. If a patient’s insurance information is unable to be verified, users can contact patients directly through Weave’s two-way text or phone system to get information fast. When combined with Weave’s Digital Forms solution, the new patient intake process is streamlined, saving staff time and reducing long phone calls with insurance companies.
Our Customers
As of December 31, 2022, we had more than 27,000 locations under subscription and more than 25,000 customers in the United States and Canada. These customers represented many industries with the majority being in dental, optometry, veterinary, medical specialty services, home services, physical therapy, audiology, and podiatry. No one single customer represents more than 5% of our revenue. 
Sales and Marketing
We employ an efficient go-to-market strategy that combines a productive sales organization with a diverse marketing and business development strategy to support their work. 
Our marketing team focuses on generating demand and increasing brand awareness through multiple strategies and a multi-channel process. Leads are generated primarily through our website through traffic driven to our website in multiple ways, including paid advertising, digital events, sponsorships, direct mail, ad placements, email campaigns, social media, free content, blogs and organic searches. As trade shows and other events are beginning to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity, we expect to increasingly rely on participation at these events to drive demand as a primary component of our sales strategy. 
Subscriptions are primarily sold through our direct inside sales team based in Lehi, Utah. Most of our sales teams are focused on attracting new customers and are trained to sell into multiple SMB verticals, organized by the sales motion (e.g., inbound, outbound, upsell, and mid-market) of each sales cycle. In addition, we have a sales team specifically focused on expanding usage within our existing customer base. Our teams use phone, email, web meetings, and in-person events to interact with our current and potential customers. 
In addition to our direct sales team and marketing teams, we have a business development team that finds, negotiates contracts and manages partner relationships. These partners include technology integration partners, key-opinion leaders, IT-installers, buying groups, affiliates and distributors. These partners refer customers to us on a commissioned basis. These referrals are then passed to the sales team to close. We also focus on growing our channel partnership programs to promote and sell our products directly through partners.
Customer Success and Support
We offer phone, AI-driven support solutions, web-chat and email-based support staff to resolve technical and operational issues for our customers, if and when such issues arise. All customer success, customer support, customer training and customer onboarding team members are currently located in the United States and India (email and chat). In addition, we maintain an online self-help center and customer discussion community to assist our customers with routine matters.
We strive to maintain an exceptional quality of customer service to promote customer retention and referrals. We continuously monitor key customer service metrics such as phone hold time, ticket response time and ticket resolution rates, and we monitor the customer satisfaction of our customer support interactions.
Research and Development
Our engineering and product teams are responsible for the creation and development of high value features and functionality across our platform and the products we support. Our teams are highly focused on the customer and strive continually to deliver the tools needed for meaningful engagements through both continued improvements of our internally-developed platform and the addition of new products. Our engineering and product teams strategically approach the design of products to serve our broad customer base while also developing customized features and products to meet the specific needs of each SMB vertical we compete in. Our engineering team also coordinates the use of open source technologies with code developed in-house to provide a cohesive experience to the customer.
We have a research and development presence in both the United States and India.
Our Technology
Weave Software Platform
Our platform is composed of microservices in a highly containerized environment, which allows for rapid scaling of resources to meet the demands of our customers. These services are built using cloud-native technologies, which allows us to take full advantage of the infrastructure- and platform-as-a-service offerings from our cloud service providers. We develop multiple client-side experiences, including web, mobile, and desktop clients, and integrate them with our phone system to provide a seamless experience for customers.
Weave Phone System
Our phone system is highly-customized, cloud-based and integrated into our software platform. We built our phone systems in-house, providing capabilities commonly found in expensive licensed hardware offerings. Our phone systems leverage our cloud infrastructure providers to provide multiple redundant regions and lowest latency routing to ensure superior voice quality on calls to and from the entire United States and Canada. 
We provide our customers with advanced business phones from a leading cloud-based communications hardware manufacturer. Once the phones are powered on and connected to a network by our customer, we provide configuration and automatic updates through the cloud. Our system also provides unlimited local and long distance voice calling within the United States and Canada to the Public Switched Telephone Network in the United States and Canada via SIP Trunking interconnects from multiple providers. 
Security
We employ multiple layers of security to protect our systems, processes, buildings, our data and customer data, and other assets.
At an organization-wide level, we have a dedicated security team with security compliance, security engineering, security operations, and application security expertise to influence the secure handling of customer data, and secure development and operation of our products. We use multiple security technologies to monitor for intrusions and known vulnerable or insecure configurations of our use of cloud infrastructure providers, systems, and applications. Our security team members monitor for, and respond to incidents, events, and insecure configurations that may lead to the potential compromise of our products or customer data.
Our team members implement a robust suite of security policies and standards to execute processes, operations, and development in a secure manner consistent with industry standards outlined by ISO 27001, AICPA Trust Service Principles, and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
At the physical and infrastructure layers, our platform and products are hosted on Google Cloud Platform. 
At the data layer, data is encrypted in transit over public networks and at rest in our backend databases and object stores using industry accepted encryption protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher; AES-256 or higher) with known strong ciphers. Customer images, voicemails, and call recordings are encrypted with unique encryption keys for each customer. Encryption keys are stored only in memory by our services, and are encrypted on disk behind our key management system.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 806 employees. We continued expanding our presence abroad during 2022 by hiring additional engineers and support representatives in India. 
We offer competitive compensation and benefits packages and strive to promote the well-being of our employees and their families by offering generous parental and other leave policies as well as flexible paid time-off policies to accommodate individual circumstances. We demonstrate our commitment to the professional development of all Weavers by offering department-specific trainings, manager development courses/tracks, executive coaching and external professional development offerings.
We also recognize that fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce makes us stronger as a company and is a key element of our employee recruitment, engagement and retention strategy. Our goal is to ensure equitable people processes with hiring, compensation, performance management, promotions and personal development. We reinforce these values by promoting an inclusive culture through trainings/
speaker series, sponsoring people resource groups, amplifying voices of underrepresented individuals, and community involvement.
Our culture is underpinned by the Weave Way, which consists of five key values that define our company, approach to people and ultimately guide all of our actions. Our employees are united by our mission and driven by our values: 
•Stay Hungry. We remain HUNGRY and are never satisfied with the status quo. We are constantly blazing new trails and innovating the very best solutions. We volunteer for the hard things, knowing that the only easy day was yesterday. We’re always asking questions and always trying to improve, knowing that our failures keep us moving onward and upward. 
•Care More. CARING deeply about those around us—including our customers, our community, and each other—is just what we do. We believe everyone is important and should be treated with respect and courtesy. We value diversity of people and thought and strive to be kind and inclusive in all of our interactions. We know that true innovation happens when everyone has the opportunity to succeed and feels valued for their contributions.
•Think Creatively. Getting CREATIVE can solve a lot of challenges. We know that great ideas can come from anyone at any time. We go out beyond our circle and get involved. We ask questions and we’re curious about the world around us, finding inspiration everywhere. We pay attention to the little things. We constantly challenge the old in order to make things better. We are scrappy and resourceful, and we never settle for ordinary.
•Do the Right Thing. We treat this business as our own, and we hold ourselves and each other ACCOUNTABLE for the goals that we set. As owners, we focus on integrity and honesty in all of our interactions and strive to do the right thing for our people, our customers and our community every day. We help one another, we speak up when we have concerns, and we understand that no problem is too small or too out of our scope to help tackle it.
•The Customer is Everything. We are laser-focused on our CUSTOMERS and care deeply about serving small businesses everywhere. They are the lifeblood of our company, our communities and our economy. We continually innovate the very best products and services with one thing on our mind: our customer. 
Competition
The market for our platform and products is rapidly evolving, significantly fragmented and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry in some segments. In many cases, our primary competition is the combination of existing point solutions, such as messaging, phone service, marketing tools, payments, CRM, analytics and social media management, that potential customers may already use to manage their businesses and in which they have made significant investments. In a broad sense, we compete with providers of customer interaction management, customer experience management, marketing solutions, business intelligence, unified communications and telecommunications and customer relationship management solutions. However, in this highly fragmented market landscape, we believe no single competitor provides a comparable comprehensive, vertically integrated customer communications and engagement platform similar to ours. As a result, sometimes displacing the outdated, in-house manual processes of our customers is our biggest challenge. We could also face competition from new market entrants, some of whom might be our current integration partners.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•platform breadth; 
•all-in-one solution package; 
•ease of deployment and use; 
•industry-specific capabilities and workflows with best-in-class product functionality;
•depth of integration with leading systems of record;
•ability to enable differentiated customer insights and engagement;
•cloud-based delivery architecture;
•customer service;
•advanced payments capabilities;
•brand recognition; and
•pricing and total cost of ownership. 
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of the factors described above. 
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is an important part of our business. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of domain names, copyright, trade secrets and trademarks, as well as through contractual provisions, our information security infrastructure and restrictions on access to or use of our proprietary technology. We have trademark applications for select marks in the United States and will pursue additional trademark applications to the extent we believe it will be beneficial. We also have registered domain names for the website that we use in our business. Additionally, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property rights agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors. Under such agreements, our employees, consultants and contractors are subject to invention assignment provisions designed to protect our proprietary information and ensure our ownership in intellectual property developed pursuant to such agreements.
Regulatory
In the United States, at the federal level, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, as a provider of Voice over Internet Protocol, or VoIP, as well as state and local regulations applicable to VoIP providers. For example, such regulations include E-911 requirements, conditions for porting of phone numbers, protection of customer data generated by the use of our services, disability access rules, providing law enforcement with access to records, and obligations to contribute to federal programs including the federal universal service fund and other regulatory funds as well as state universal service programs. We are also subject to E-911 surcharges (typically governed by localities and/or state departments of revenue). In Canada, our VoIP service subscriptions are regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC, which, among other things, imposes requirements like those in the United States related to the provision of E-911 services. 
Additionally, we are subject to several laws in the United States and Canada that regulate communications between businesses and their customers, and protect consumers from unwanted messages and telephone calls. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN-SPAM, and Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, or CASL. To the extent that our subscribers use our SMS texting, VoIP telephone, email marketing, and fax services, we provide features and functionality that enable our subscribers to manage their compliance with these customer protection laws. As electronic messaging increases in popularity, we expect regulations and best practices in this area to continue evolving, which may impact our ability to offer services and our cost to deliver our services.
As we expand internationally, we will be subject to laws and regulations in the countries in which we offer our subscriptions. Regulatory treatment of communications services over the internet outside the United States varies from country to country, and may be more onerous than imposed on our subscriptions in the United States. Our regulatory obligations in foreign jurisdictions could have a material adverse effect on the use of our subscriptions in international locations.
In the course of providing our services, we collect, store, and process many types of data, including personal data. Moreover, our customers can use our subscriptions to store contact and other personal or identifying information, and to process, transmit, receive, store, and retrieve a variety of communications and messages, including information about their own customers and other contacts. Customers are able, and may be authorized under certain circumstances, to use our subscriptions to transmit, receive, and/or store personal information, including Protected Health Information or Personal Health Information. The collection, use, processing, or disclosure of personal information may be subject to United States and Canadian federal, state and provincial regulations, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA; the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA (California); US state data breach notification laws; and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA (Canada).
In addition to these regulations, many states continue to consider enacting privacy legislation that may apply to companies such as us which collect, store, and process many types of data, including personal data. In particular, California has enacted the CPRA. The CPRA imposes obligations on qualifying for-profit companies, such as us, doing business in California, and substantially increases potential liability for such companies for failure to comply with data protection rules applicable to California residents.
As internet commerce and communication technologies continue to evolve, thereby increasing online service providers’ and network users’ capacity to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process, and transmit large volumes of personal information, increasingly restrictive regulation by federal, state, or foreign agencies becomes more likely.
Regulations that do not directly apply to our business, but which do apply to our customers and partners, can also impact our business. As we expand our business, addressing customer and partner requirements in new jurisdictions and new verticals often requires investment on our part to address regulations that apply to our customers. Globally, these regulations continue to be introduced and to change over time. Such regulations can impact our ability to offer services to various customer segments, and our cost to deliver our services.
