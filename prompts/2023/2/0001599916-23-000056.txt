Item 1. Business
Corporate History
 
Photozou Holdings, Inc., ("Photozou Holdings," or the "Company"), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 29, 2014, with the purposes to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware (the "DGCL").
 
The Company was formed by Thomas DeNunzio, our former sole officer and director, for the purpose of creating a corporation which could be used to consummate a merger or acquisition.
 
On January 13, 2017, Thomas DeNunzio sold 8,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock, which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time, to Photozou Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation.
 
The shares were sold for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000. Photozou Co., Ltd. is and was controlled by Koichi Ishizuka, a Japanese citizen. The aforementioned shares were sold pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S"). No directed selling efforts were made in the United States.
 
On January 13, 2017, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. 
 
On January 13, 2017, Mr. Koichi Ishizuka was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.
 
On January 18, 2017, we changed our name from Exquisite Acquisition, Inc. to Photozou Holdings, Inc. 
 
Pursuant to our Registration Statement deemed effective on June 20, 2017, we, “the Company,” sold a total of 3,037,300 shares of our common stock. The proceeds totaled $75,933. These shares were sold pursuant to Rule 419.
 
On May 8, 2018, the Company conducted a stock cancellation of the above 3,037,300 shares and the total funds of $75,933 were returned to investors. The cancellation of the shares and return of funds was due to the fact that we did not make an acquisition in the allotted time granted by Rule 419.
 
On May 31, 2018, the Company entered into and consummated a Stock Purchase Agreement with Koichi Ishizuka, our President, CEO, and Director. At the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Koichi Ishizuka transferred to the Company, 10,000 shares of common stock of Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation (“Photozou Koukoku”), which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares, in consideration of 1,000,000 JPY ($9,190 USD as of the exchange rate May 31, 2018). The Company has since gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of Photozou Koukoku’s common stock and Photozou Koukoku became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and Photozou Koukoku were under common control at the time of the acquisition.
 
Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd. was incorporated under the laws of Japan on March 14, 2017. Currently, Photozou Koukoku is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The Company’s primary business is focused on online advertising, photo session services, and the sale of used cameras.
 
On September 21, 2020 Photozou Co., Ltd our principal controlling shareholder, entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Koichi Ishizuka, our Sole Officer and Director. Pursuant to the closing of the Agreement on September 21, 2020, Photozou Co., Ltd. transferred to Koichi Ishizuka 4,553,200 shares of our common stock, which represented, at the time, approximately 56.9% of our issued and outstanding common stock, in consideration of JPY 6,657,917 (approximately $60,500). Following the closing of the share purchase transaction, Koichi Ishizuka owns approximately 66.7% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Photozou Co., Ltd. was and remains owned and controlled entirely by Koichi Ishizuka, we do not believe that this transaction is deemed to be a change in control of the Company.
 
Overview
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 4-30-4F, Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0004, Japan.
 
The Company has elected November 30th as its fiscal year end.
 
Currently, we operate through our wholly owned subsidiary, Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd., “Photozou Koukoku”, which is engaged in advertising services, photo session services, and selling used cameras. 
 
Photozou Koukoku was incorporated under the laws of Japan on March 14, 2017.
 
Currently, Photozou Koukoku is headquartered at 4-30-4F, Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0004, Japan. Photozou Koukoku’s office space is provided rent free by our Chief Executive Officer, Koichi Ishizuka.
 
Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd.’s business operations are primarily focused around the sale of used cameras sold through Amazon USA, photo session services held in Tokyo and Kansai, and online advertising through various channels. On April 17, 2017, Photozou Koukoku obtained a license to operate as a used goods merchant in Japan.
 
Background of Operations - Sale of Cameras
 
Photozou Koukoku resells used cameras as its primary business, which include mainly high-class digital single lens reflex cameras produced by well-known Japanese camera makers, e.g. Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm, etc.
 
The camera industry in Japan is a multi-billion-dollar industry and cameras made in Japan have worldwide appeal and recognition. This is due to the fact that common household name camera manufacturers such as Canon, Nikon, Sony and several others, are headquartered in Japan and sell high end, digital cameras, generally associated with high quality.
 
The Company believes that due to the high quality of cameras created by Japanese camera makers that these will be the most appealing products to offer to the USA and Japanese market.
 
However, should market trends shift and the demand for cameras of other companies see a surge in popularity then Photozou Koukoku may consider the possibility of acquiring and reselling cameras by other manufacturers. It may also consider the possibility of selling electronics that serve other purposes other than taking photographs, but have a camera embedded in them, such as camera phones. At this time however, the focus is to sell used high-class digital single lens reflex cameras.
 
Purchasing
 
Photozou Koukoku primarily purchases used cameras from used camera dealers and individual consumers in Japan. Photozou Koukoku’s supporting website at http://photozou.jp/kaitori/top/ can be used by interested parties to access pertinent information relating to selling their cameras. For example, there is a section of the website which discloses a price list by product. Through the website they can also request an estimate, review Photozou Koukoku’s procedure for purchasing cameras and fill out an application to sell their camera. Currently, Photozou Koukoku has hired, as an independent contractor, Mr. Takaharu Ogami to handle the entirety of all purchasing and selling activities of Photozou Koukoku’s camera business. Relating to his services to Photozou Koukoku, Mr. Takaharu is paid a monthly fee in amount of JPY 450,000 ($3,469). Mr. Ogami is responsible for the sale and shipping of the cameras at the expense of Photozou Koukoku. Photozou Koukoku is the legal owner of the camera(s) until the point of sale to the purchaser or purchaser(s).

Inventory
 
The Company consigns its operations regarding the sale of cameras to Mr. Ogami. Inventory, however, remains under legal ownership of the Company.
 
As of November 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company held inventory comprised solely of used cameras in the amount of $58,780 and $99,797, respectively. The aforementioned amounts were presented net of allowance for inventory obsolescence as of November 30, 2022 and 2021 totaling $11,900 and $0, respectively.
Selling
 
Photozou Koukoku sells its used cameras through Amazon. Cameras are then shipped to the purchaser for a fee that is determined at the time of sale, and may differ on a case-by-case basis depending on the type of camera and method of delivery.
Advertising Services
 
At present, Photozou Koukoku conducts a single type of advertising service. The Company utilizes web advertising services specifically geared toward advertisements that are placed on what is known as “The Photozou-Social Networking Service.” The aforementioned is a social networking website, primarily for photo sharing. Its web address can be found here: http://photozou.jp/?lang=en. The online social networking website is owned entirely by Photozou Co., Ltd., a Japan Corporation, which our CEO and Director, Koichi Ishizuka, also owns and controls in its entirety.
 
Herein, we may refer to the aforementioned social networking website as “the Photozou-SNS”, “SNS”, “the website” or “the social networking site.”
 
Photozou Koukoku develops banner ads for third party companies and subsequently assists those clients with having those advertisements placed on the Photozou-SNS. Fees are determined on a case-by-case basis and vary depending on whether or not Photozou Co., Ltd contracts Photozou Koukoku to work with a pre-existing client, or if Photozou Koukoku obtains the client on its own accord.
 
It is possible that the Company will expand into offering additional online advertising services and will create advertisements in forms other than banner ads, but no such plans have been fully developed at this point in time.
 
The Company has suspended its involvement with online photo contests indefinitely, a service the Company was previously engaged in. This decision came about as a result of the closure of the photo magazine “Photo Technic Digital”, which was our collaborative partner in regard to photo contests, social networking and magazine collaboration. We are of the understanding that the closure of Photo Technic Digital was the result of impacts the magazine suffered resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
Photo session services
 
Starting in April 2021, Photozou Koukoku began providing commercial photo session services to customers. The customers sign up for a photo session and Photozou Koukoku organizes the session in which customers can take photos of models provided by Photozou Koukoku for the customer. The rights to any images or video taken by the customer are retained by the Company, models, and model’s office, not the customer. The photo sessions are intended to be a skill building activity as the Company believes many customers in Japan are interested in improving their photographic skills. Photographers shall not publish images or videos taken at the photo sessions without the consent of both the Company and the model whose pictures are taken. These photo sessions are held every weekend in Osaka and Tokyo since April, 2021 and February, 2022, respectively.
 
Approximately, 23 models are associated with the photo session services provided in Osaka (https://www.primavera-photo-session.com/). Approximately, 11 models are part of Photozou Koukoku photo sessions conducted in Tokyo (https://www.pps-tokyo.jp/). It is our intention to increase the number of models available for photo sessions, through the assistance of a third-party company, Blossom Report Co., Ltd., with whom we have entered into a monthly contract in which we pay 50,000 JPY ($385) per month for introduction(s) to models as well as their assistance with contacting and interviewing prospective models.
 
Customers pay an all-inclusive fee directly to Photozou Koukoku, who in turn pays any associated costs or other expenses, including the amounts paid to the models. 
 
Promotional activity
 
Our CEO, Koichi Ishizuka, has verbally consented that we may utilize the SNS to promote and advertise our own services.
 
We believe there to be a clear synergy between the operations of Photozou Koukoku and the Photozou-SNS, as Photozou-SNS is a website where users can upload and share pictures taken with their cameras. It is our belief that many individuals who are sharing, browsing, and evaluating photographs online will have an interest in purchasing cameras for personal use and potentially to upload more photos on the website.
