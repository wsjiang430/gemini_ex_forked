Marketing and Competition
L.B. Foster Company generally markets its Rail products and services directly in all major industrial areas of the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Precast and Steel Products and Measurement products and services are primarily marketed domestically. The Company employs a sales force of approximately 79 people that is supplemented with a network of agents across Europe, South America, and Asia to reach current customers and cultivate potential customers in these areas. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 24% of the Company’s total sales were outside the U.S.
The major markets for the Company’s products are highly competitive. Product availability, quality, service, and price are principal factors of competition within each of these markets. No other company provides the same product mix to the various markets the Company serves. However, there are one or more companies that compete with the Company in each product line. Therefore, the Company faces significant competition from different groups of companies.
Raw Materials and Supplies
The Company purchases a variety of raw materials from its supplier base including steel, aggregate, epoxy, electronics, and components, from both domestic and foreign suppliers. Products are also purchased in the form of finished or semi-finished products which the majority of it is supplied from domestic and foreign steel producers. Generally, the Company has a number of vendor options.
The Company’s purchases from foreign suppliers are subject to foreign currency exchange rate changes and the risks associated with changes in international conditions, as well as U.S. and international laws that could impose import restrictions on selected classes of products and for anti-dumping duties if products are sold in the U.S. at prices that are below specified prices.
Backlog
The Company’s backlog represents the sales price of customer purchase orders or contracts in which the performance obligations have not been met, and therefore are precluded from revenue recognition. Although the Company believes that the orders included in backlog are firm, customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice; however, these instances are rare. Backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company’s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company owns a number of domestic and international patents and trademarks, primarily related to products in its Global Friction Management and Technology Services and Solutions business units, as well as its Precast Concrete Products business unit. The Company’s business segments are not dependent upon any individual patents or related group of patents, nor any individual licenses or distribution rights. The Company believes that, in the aggregate, the rights under its patents, trademarks, and licenses are generally important to its operations, but considers neither any individual patent, nor any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product, to be of material importance in relation to its total business.

Environmental, Social, and Governance Matters
As part of its ongoing commitment to good corporate stewardship, in 2022 the Company hired an employee in a newly created full-time role to focus on and enhance its sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) initiatives. The position is intended to facilitate collaboration with the Board of Directors, senior leadership, investors, employees, customers, and societal and civic organizations to integrate ESG policies, frameworks, goals, and metrics into the Company’s business risk and opportunity strategies.
