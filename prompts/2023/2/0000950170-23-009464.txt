 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 Quest Resource Holding Corporation (“Quest”, “the Company”, “our company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a national provider of waste and recycling services to customers from across multiple industry sectors that are typically larger, multi-location businesses. We create customer-specific programs and perform the related services for the collection, processing, recycling, disposal, and tracking of waste streams and recyclables. Our programs and services enable our customers to address their business, sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) goals and responsibilities.
 We believe our services are comprehensive, innovative, and cost effective. Our services are designed to enable our business customers to capture the commodity value of their waste streams and recyclables, better manage their disposal and total operating costs, enhance their management of environmental risks, enhance their legal and regulatory compliance, and achieve their business and environmental goals while maximizing the efficiency of their assets. Our services currently focus on the waste streams and recyclables from big box grocers and other specialty retailers; automotive after-market operations such as automotive maintenance, quick lube, dealerships, and collision repair; transportation, logistics, and fleet operators; manufacturing and industrial facilities; multi-family and commercial properties; restaurant chains and food operations; malls and shopping centers; and construction and demolition projects. We currently concentrate on programs for recycling motor oil and automotive lubricants, oil filters, scrap tires, oily water, goods destruction, food waste, meat renderings, cooking oil and grease trap waste, plastics, cardboard, pallets, metal, glass, mixed paper, construction debris, as well as a large variety of regulated and non-regulated solid, liquid, and gas wastes. In addition, we offer products such as antifreeze and windshield washer fluid, dumpster and compacting equipment, and other minor ancillary services.
 Quest also provides information and data that tracks and reports the detailed transactional and environmental results of our services and provides actionable data to improve business operations. The data we generate enables our customers to address their environmental goals and responsibilities and to report to internal and external parties such as employees, investors, business partners, and governmental agencies.
 Industry Overview
 The multi-billion-dollar solid waste collection and disposal business drives the overall waste industry. The size of the recycling industry has increased in recent years and is expected to continue to increase as environmental concerns increase, landfill space decreases, businesses and consumers seek alternatives to delivering their recyclables and disposables to landfills, and businesses are subject to increased expectations to exhibit and report on their environmental actions and impact. ESG reporting requirements have driven demand for comprehensive and reliable data. Although society and industry have increased the awareness of environmental issues, such as recycling, reuse, and proper disposal, waste production also continues to increase. Because of environmental concerns, local government regulations, and cost factors, it has become increasingly difficult to obtain the necessary permits to build any new landfills. There is recognition by U.S. public agencies, businesses, and consumers that many items deposited in landfills have commodity value or usability as material for new products. Improvements in recycling and reuse technologies and efficient secondary markets for recycled commodities have made recycling a cost-attractive alternative.
 Regulatory measures and more stringent control of material bound for disposal make the management of solid waste a difficult problem. The EPA, and state and local governments are generally expected to continue the present trend of restricting the amount of potentially recyclable material bound for landfills. Governmental authorities have passed, or are reported to be contemplating, measures that require industrial and commercial companies to recycle all or a portion of their disposable materials and restrict the percentage of recyclable materials in any commercial load of disposable material. We believe that these measures, along with the economic value of recyclable materials, may create additional opportunities as proper disposal of materials becomes more specialized. Some large industrial and commercial companies have in-house personnel that handle their solid waste management and recycling responsibilities, but many have found that in-house handling of these responsibilities may not be an effective solution without adequate knowledge, experience, resources, and staff support. We offer these companies and other establishments a solution to this increasing burden.
 Our Strategy
 Our goal is to be a leading environmental services company. Key elements of our strategy to achieve our goal include the following:
 •Recycling Services. We intend to continue to enhance the comprehensive, one-stop services that we provide for the waste streams and recyclables produced by our business customers.
 •Emphasize Monetary and other Benefits of Recycling. We intend to emphasize the monetary advantages of recycling by demonstrating to businesses their ability to capture the commodity value of their waste streams and recyclables, better manage their disposal and total operating cost, enhance their management of environmental risks, enhance their legal and regulatory compliance, and achieve their business, sustainability, and ESG goals.



•Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We plan to capitalize on the significant market, technology, and process opportunities available in the environmental and recycling services industry. As a result of our considerable industry experience and relationships, we believe we are well positioned to identify and evaluate acquisition candidates and assess their growth prospects, the quality of their management teams, their local reputation with customers, and the suitability of their locations. We believe we are regarded as an attractive acquiror because of (1) our historical performance of successfully developing, servicing and growing customer relationships; (2) the experience and reputation of our management team within the industry; (3) our ability to bring our vendor network to service accounts; (4) our ability to integrate customer service, invoicing, accounting and other financial functions into our company, which generally enables the management of an acquired company to continue their involvement in the combined company by focusing on existing and new customers; (5) the ability of management and employees of acquired companies to participate in our potential growth and expansion through a combination of stock ownership, performance linked incentives, and career advancement opportunities; and (6) the ability to offer liquidity to the owners of acquired companies through the receipt of common stock or cash.
 •Expand our Customer Base. We intend to continue to expand the customer base for our services by focusing on the expertise we have gained and the value proposition that we offer to our business customers in terms of overall improved waste program economics, recyclable commodity value, flexible programs, broad service offerings, data reporting, and national capacities that we believe provides us with competitive advantages in expanding our customer base.
 •Expand into New Customer Verticals. We plan to expand to serve growing industries that we do not currently service, but that generate waste streams and recyclables that can benefit from our ability to manage a large variety of waste streams and recyclables, respond quickly to service requests, and provide what we consider industry-leading collection, processing, and data reporting. 
 •Expand the Types of Materials Covered by our Services. We plan to expand the types of waste streams and recyclables covered by our services. To date, our revenue has been generated primarily from our solutions for used oil, oil filters, scrap tires, grease and cooking oil, solid waste, food waste, metals, cardboard, and regulated materials. We believe that we can provide value to our business customers by servicing a larger portion of disposable and recyclable materials, including construction and debris waste.
 •Maintain Virtual Facilities and Equipment. We plan to continue to pursue an “asset light” strategy that utilizes third-party vendors or subcontractors for the collection, sorting, and processing of recyclable and waste materials for businesses. This strategy results in a scalable business model that enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of developing service solutions that are better aligned to each customer’s needs and selling recyclable materials at volumes that provide favorable prices; enables us to render our services on a national basis without the need for an extensive workforce, multiple facilities, or numerous vehicles; allows us to negotiate with multiple subcontractors to optimize our pricing; and reduces our capital expenditures and working capital requirements.
 •Leverage Governmental and Social Factors Expanding Recycling. We intend to leverage the demands by governmental authorities and by the public to expand efforts to recycle materials because of concerns about sustainability, greenhouse gases, and other environmental concerns, including the proliferation of ESG initiatives as evidenced by the SEC’s recent proposed rules.
 •Pursue Strategic Technologies and Processes. We plan to identify, investigate, develop, and deliver new technologies and processes that we believe have the potential to contribute additional economic and financial value.
 Our Environmental Services
 Recycling and Waste Services
 We provide businesses across multiple industry sectors with a single source service solution for the reuse, recycling, and disposal of a wide variety of waste streams and recyclables generated by their operations. We provide a single point of contact for managing the wide variety of disposables and recyclables produced. Our services can help our customers better manage their operational expenses, maximize the value of their recyclable commodities, comply with federal, state and local regulations, and help them foster environmental stability and sustainability. We can provide disposal and recycling services for virtually all forms of solids and liquids, although our current services primarily relate to used motor oil, oil filters, scrap tires, solid waste, metals, grease, cooking oil, food waste, expired food products, glass, cardboard, paper, industrial cleaning (separator cleaning and tank cleaning), plastics, construction debris, universal waste (batteries, mercury, lights), regulated waste, and electronic devices.
 In addition, we help customers to safely transport, treat, and dispose of a full spectrum of non-recyclable regulated waste.
Our value proposition to our business customers is simple. We seek to
 •ensure our customers can focus on their core businesses instead of waste disposal and recycling;
 •provide cost-effective choices that improve overall operational economics and maximize the value of recyclable commodities;



•help our customers with flexible programs that work toward sustainability and ESG initiatives by lowering the percentage of the waste streams that must be disposed of in landfills and providing the necessary data to report accurate and complete results;
 •assist our customers with liability protection and services to assist with environmental compliance; and
 •provide our customers with a centralized point of contact with the convenience of 24/7/365 support.
 Many waste materials (such as scrap metal, cardboard, plastics, used cooking oil, and automotive fluids) have commodity value that can be recovered and converted into new products and resources. Recovering valuable materials is a key factor in lower-waste and zero-waste initiatives, and presents a profitable opportunity for businesses. The recovery of valuable materials is a strong motivator to educate businesses and consumers about proper disposal.
 We provide our services on a national basis as well as in certain international regions. We currently service tens of thousands of locations for various customers throughout the United States (including Puerto Rico) and Canada. Our customers generally have multiple locations. We continue to broaden the range of industries we serve and the nature and extent of the services we provide, which enables us to constantly target new customers and provide additional services to existing customers.
 Our recycling services often reduce our customers’ disposal costs by reducing the level of disposable material delivered to landfills and capturing the commodity value of their waste streams and recyclables. We are independent of any specific materials hauler or recycling facility operator, which allows us to seek the best services and optimize the cost of services.
We provide certain industries and businesses with specialized services, such as the following:
 •Automotive, Fleet and Industry Services.  We provide a selection of services or a turn-key option involving the handling of scrap tires, HDPE plastics, used oil, used oil filters, parts cleaners, paint wastes, industrial fluids, used antifreeze, regulated waste, wastewater, and spent chemicals.
 •Construction Services. We help construction site managers across the United States recycle construction waste, including cardboard, plastics, metal, pallets, wood, drywall, and concrete. In addition, we provide temporary containers, offices, storage, toilets, eye washing stations, and water holding tanks.
 •Food/Organic Waste. We provide recycling programs that focus on the highest use of food waste according to the EPA’s Food Recovery Hierarchy. Our programs focus on various types of food facilities (grocers, manufacturers, distributors, etc.) to capture the maximum amount of food and other organic waste material and to use the most valuable recovery process available to meet their business and sustainability goals.
 •Manufacturing Services. We collect and recycle waste streams that are unique to certain manufacturing facilities and can many times be sold as a commodity to offset operating costs for the customers. 
 •Solid Waste. We began offering solid waste collection as a way of becoming a one-stop shop for existing and prospective customers. The solid waste business provides incremental revenue streams, rounds out our offerings, and provides opportunities to expand into other specialized services.
 Landfill Diversion of Food Waste
 According to the EPA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, approximately one-third of the nation’s food goes to waste. The EPA has found that discarded food is one of the largest components (depending on classification) of the nation’s solid waste. The issue of how to reduce such waste is critical. We develop targeted programs to address these issues.
Our food waste program seeks to reduce the amount of produce, bakery, deli materials, expired dairy, and other food and beverage products in landfills and to find a better solution. A large portion of the nation’s disposable material consists of organics, produce, bakery and deli items, dairy products, and vegetation trimmings, all of which can be recycled. Our program offers a variety of options, including the following:
 •Reduction. We can study a customer’s current organic material management situation and determine how best to alter current ordering and display options to reduce landfill use.
 •Animal Feed. Through our network of vendors, we can channel a percentage of organic material into a process in which the product is dehydrated and put back into animal feed. 
 •Waste-to-Energy. We can offer a process that involves the creation of energy in the form of electricity through the use of anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion is a series of processes in which microorganisms break down biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen. This process is widely used as a renewable energy source because it produces a methane and carbon dioxide rich bio-gas suitable for energy production, which is helping to replace fossil fuels. The nutrient-rich digestate also can be used as fertilizer. We currently employ a network of service providers that utilize this method as a form of organic disposal.



•Compost/Land Application/Soil Treatment. We can offer composting or land application/soil treatments for organic materials. In composting or land application/soil treatments, organic materials are placed either in a custom vessel or spread out and allowed to decompose naturally. Composting sites have several options for turning and rotating the product to maximize the nutrient content of the end product and speed the turn-around time. Land application/soil treatment facilities typically do not regularly turn the product or add any components and allow nature to return the nutrients to the host soil on its own timetable. Composting facilities also typically bag or sell the product by the truck/train load to individuals or municipalities, whereas land application/soil treatment facilities leave the product where it is initially placed. We have employed these methods with several customers across the country.
 Data and Reporting
 The wide variety of recycling and waste services, volumes, diversion data, and related documents are organized in a cloud-based, centralized data collection providing operational insight, environmental tracking, and flexible reporting.
Sales and Marketing
 We market our services throughout the United States primarily through a direct sales force and selected strategic partnerships. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on emphasizing the benefits of our nationwide, one-stop, comprehensive service offerings and the ability to improve overall customers’ operational economics, maximize the value of their recyclable commodities, and foster the benefits of environmental sustainability. We plan to continue to increase our sales and marketing efforts.
 We have targeted various industries for marketing our sustainability services. Some of the industries that we target and the nature of the products and services that we market to those industries are as follows:
 •Automotive/Transportation
 oRetail service providers (car dealerships, tire dealerships, quick lubes, aftermarket automotive parts and accessories retailers, automotive service franchises, car washes)
 oTrucking and fleet
 oCar and equipment rental companies
•Manufacturing
 oPackaging
 oFood and beverages
 oMachinery and industrial
 oChemicals and lubricants
 •Hospitality and Retail
 oGrocers
 oBig box
 oSpecialty
 oRestaurants
 oHotels and stadiums
 oMalls and shopping centers
 •Construction and Demolition
 oCommercial
 oMulti-family
 oIndustrial
 •Commercial and Multi-family Property Management
 Customers
 We generally enter into multi-year contracts with our customers that are designed to provide us with recurring monthly revenue. These contracts structure our revenue primarily in three ways: fixed fee, contracted pricing, or revenue from the sale of commodities.



Our business depends to a significant extent on revenue from our largest customers. Any material reduction in the business we do with those customers could have an adverse effect on our company. Two customers accounted for 24% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, and two customers accounted for 38% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.
We believe that we are unique in our ability to offer comprehensive national solutions in the highly fractionalized waste, disposal, and recycling service business. Through customer service driven culture, national presence, logistics management, compliance, and commodity brokerage, our solution delivers the critical knowhow and experience necessary to implement and execute multi-point reuse, recycling, disposal, and waste management services.
 Competitors
 Recycling and Waste Disposal Services
 The recycling and waste disposal industry as a whole is dominated by large multi-billion dollar companies, such as Waste Management and Republic Services. To date, these large companies have concentrated on their traditional business of collecting waste for disposal in their landfills rather than recycling, which reduces the need for landfills. The strategies of these large companies could change at any time, and we could begin to experience substantially increased competition from them. These companies have substantially greater market recognition, substantially larger customer bases, and substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than we possess and that afford them competitive advantages over us. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of services similar to those we offer, to provide comparable services at lower prices, and to introduce new solutions and respond to customer requirements more quickly than we can.
Scope of Competitors’ Services
 Our services address a broad and comprehensive scope of materials such as motor oil, scrap tires, grease, meat, organics, regulated waste, construction debris, cardboard, pallets, plastics, metals, and solid waste. Most of our competitors specialize in only one or a few of these service areas. In delivering our services, we have subcontracted at times to our competitors, thereby utilizing them as our subcontractors.
 While we have many competitors for certain aspects of our business, we are unaware of any provider that provides the wide breadth of our waste, recycling, and data services, deliverable across all locations in the United States and Canada, with flexibility to adapt and modify programs and to comprehensively deliver sustainable solutions.
State and Federal Environmental Regulations
 We use our best efforts to be in compliance with federal, state, and local environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, as amended, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, the Clean Air Act, as amended, and the Clean Water Act. Such compliance has not historically constituted a material expense to us.
 The collection and disposal of solid waste and rendering of related environmental services as well as recycling operations and issues are subject to federal, state, and local requirements, which regulate health, safety, the environment, zoning, and land-use. Federal, state, and local regulations vary, but generally govern hauling, disposal, and recycling activities and the location and use of facilities and also impose restrictions to prohibit or minimize air and water pollution. In addition, governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose fines in the case of violations, including criminal penalties. The EPA and various other federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety agencies and authorities, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor, administer those regulations.
 We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to assist our customers in their compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While such amounts expended in environmental compliance in the past or that we anticipate spending in the future have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations, the possibility remains that technological, regulatory, or enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies, or other factors could materially alter this expectation.
 Each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liability for such matters. Several governmental authorities have enacted laws that will require counties to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste landfills through waste planning, composting, recycling, or other programs. Legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and materials recycling also are under consideration by Congress and the EPA.
 Finally, various states have enacted, or are considering enacting, laws that restrict the disposal within the state of solid or hazardous wastes generated outside the state. While courts have declared unconstitutional laws that overtly discriminate against out of state waste, courts have upheld some laws that are less overtly discriminatory. Challenges to other such laws are pending.



Equipment and Installation
 We currently pursue an “asset light” strategy that utilizes third-party subcontractors for the collection, sorting, and processing of recyclable and waste materials for businesses. While we own a limited amount of compacting and other service equipment, we do not own significant recycling or waste management assets, such as trucks or landfills, or have a significant number of employees devoted to in-the-field recycling operations. As part of our operations, we maintain strong relationships with a multitude of subcontractors. Our more than 3,500 third-party relationships currently provide us with an estimated 30,000 trained professionals, 25,000 trucks, and over 1,000 recycling facilities. This strategy results in a scalable business model that enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of developing service solutions that are attractive to customers and the sale of recyclable materials at the highest prices, enables us to render our services on a national basis without the need for multiple facilities or numerous vehicles, allows us to negotiate with multiple providers for the best cost of service, and reduces our capital expenditures and working capital requirements.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 203 persons, of whom 197 were full time employees. Three were executive employees, 113 were administrative and customer services employees, 74 were accounting and finance employees and 13 were sales and marketing employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us.
Intellectual Property

 Our History
 We were incorporated in Nevada in July 2002 under the name BlueStar Financial Group, Inc. Prior to 2010, we were a “shell company” under the rules of the SEC. On March 30, 2010, we (i) closed a transaction to acquire Youchange, Inc., an Arizona corporation, or “Youchange”, as a wholly owned subsidiary, (ii) ceased being a shell company, and (iii) experienced a change in control in which the former stockholders of Youchange acquired control of our company. In May 2010, we changed our name to YouChange Holdings Corp.
 On October 17, 2012, immediately prior to closing a merger transaction with Earth911, Inc., or “Earth911”, we filed Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to (i) change our name to Infinity Resources Holdings Corp., (ii) increase our shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share (the “Common Stock”), authorized for issuance, (iii) authorize shares of preferred stock to be designated in series or classes as our board of directors may determine, (iv) effect a reverse split of our Common Stock, and (v) divide our board of directors into classes, as nearly equal in number as possible. On October 17, 2012, we closed the merger transaction, or the “Earth911 Merger”, to acquire Earth911 as a wholly-owned subsidiary and experienced a change in control in which the former stockholders of Earth911 acquired control of our company.
 On July 16, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Quest Resource Management Group, LLC, or “QRMG”, held by Quest Resource Group LLC, or “QRG”, comprising 50% of the membership interests of QRMG, or the “QRMG Interests.” Our wholly owned subsidiary, Earth911, held the remaining 50% of the membership interests of QRMG for several years. Concurrently with our acquisition of the QRMG Interests, we assigned the QRMG Interests to Earth911 so that Earth911 now holds 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of QRMG. On October 28, 2013, we changed our name to Quest Resource Holding Corporation, increased our shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance, and changed our trading symbol to “QRHC.”
 On February 20, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Earth Media Partners, LLC to sell certain assets of our wholly owned subsidiary, Earth 911, related to the Earth911.com website business in exchange for an aggregate earn-out amount of


approximately $350,000 and a 19% interest in Earth Media Partners, LLC. Earth911 was subsequently renamed Quest Sustainability Services, Inc.
 On October 19, 2020, we acquired substantially all of the assets used in the business of Green Remedies Waste and Recycling, Inc. ("Green Remedies"), a leading provider of independent environmental services, particularly in multi-family housing, located in Burlington, NC.
 On December 7, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of RWS Facility Services, LLC (“RWS”), a full-service management company engaged in the brokering of recycling, waste and sustainability solutions, located in Chadds Ford, PA.
 Recent Developments
 On February 10, 2022, we acquired an independent environmental services company that primarily services customers in the northeast region of the United States for approximately $3.35 million. This acquisition was paid in cash and was financed with a draw down on the term loan pursuant to the existing Credit Agreement with Monroe Capital as defined in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.
