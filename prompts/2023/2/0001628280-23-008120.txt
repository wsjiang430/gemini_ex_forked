Item 1. Business
Bowman is a professional services firm delivering innovative engineering solutions to customers who own, develop, and maintain the built environment. We provide planning, engineering, construction management, commissioning, environmental consulting, geospatial, survey, land procurement and other technical services to customers operating in a diverse set of end markets.
Gary Bowman, our President, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and largest stockholder, founded Bowman in 1995. Over the past 10 years, we have experienced a roughly five-fold increase in revenue to $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We were recently ranked 118 on the ENR Top 500 Design Firms list, up from 144 in 2021. We have achieved this increase in revenue through both organic growth and acquisitions. Our workforce of nearly 1,600 employees, as of December 31, 2022, provides services to thousands of customer projects both big and small, and both short- and long-term, from more than 70 offices throughout the United States and one office in Mexico. 
We work as both a prime and sub-consultant for a broad base of public and private sector customers that generally operate in regulated environments. Our public sector assignments originate from customers that are utilities, government agencies (federal, state, and local), military branches, school systems, transportation departments, water authorities and other general infrastructure managers. Our private sector assignments originate from customers that operate in commercial markets including building infrastructure for commercial, residential and municipal structures; transportation and traffic planning; power and utility systems; water and wastewater provisioning and treatment; mining for precious metals and general use aggregates; and energy services focused on decarbonization alternatives. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 21% and 18%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from public sector assignments.
We are defined by our core values and purpose. Our culture revolves around a top to bottom commitment to the creation of opportunities for aspiring people to thrive and achieve ambitious goals. We are committed to promoting inclusion and engagement in our workplace, principles we believe are critical to our success. We continue to focus on the hiring, retention, and advancement of a representative workforce. We have focused our recent efforts in four areas: inspiring innovation through an engaging culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire diverse talent; advocating and facilitating internal affinity groups; and identifying opportunities to implement environmental, social and governance initiatives.
We have a diversified business that is not dependent on any one service line, geographic region, or end market. We are deliberate in our efforts to balance our sources of revenue and avoid reliance on any one significant customer, service line, geography, or end market concentration. As a result, we believe our business is resilient and less exposed to the impacts of political and economic cycles. 
We develop and maintain loyal and long-standing relationships with our customers that result in repeat assignments. We believe these relationships benefit us through lower business development and client acquisition expenses as compared to those associated with developing new customers. Our strategic focus is on penetrating and expanding our presence in markets which best afford us opportunities to secure assignments that provide reoccurring revenue and multi-year customer engagements. These engagements typically produce dependable and predictable revenue streams with high employee utilization which leads to increased profitability. More than 70% of our revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, was derived from repeat customers, defined as those who generated project revenue in each of the past three years.
To date, we have been highly acquisitive, having closed on a total of 17 acquisitions since becoming a public company. Our target for acquisitions has focused on companies with annual revenue of between $3 million and $5 million, with the largest being $28 million and the smallest being less than $1 million. Our acquisition objectives include earnings accretion, geographic and market diversification, scale, cross-selling and revenue synergy, and talent acquisition.
While our business is not subject to significant regulation, the services we provide to our customers address various federal, state and local regulations that must be complied with to receive approval to proceed. In connection with the process of bidding for and being awarded certain government assignments we are required to provide an annual Federal Acquisition Regulation rate audit that determines our level of eligibility for overhead reimbursement. This rate can vary by state and by contracting organization. With respect to the operation of our business, we are subject to professional licensing requirements that vary by state.
Table of Content

Each state within the United States establishes licensing and organizational requirements for our services. Certain states allow only individuals and individually owned professional services corporations to hold licenses. In those states, there may be grandfathering exemptions that allow corporations to hold licenses. In the event a state does not allow a corporation to hold a license, we have in the past formed professional services corporations owned by Mr. Bowman and other employees to facilitate our ability to work in such states. In connection with our initial public offering, we purchased a qualified North Carolina corporation and during 2022 we purchased a qualified New York surveying corporation. To the extent we cannot adequately satisfy a state’s licensing requirements, we do not operate in that state. As of December 31, 2022, we were licensed to operate in all states within the continental United States.
During our 27 years in the engineering and consulting business, we have worked with a diverse collection of customers across many industries and end markets. Many of our customers have generated revenue in each of the past three years. The customers we serve are international, national, regional and local in their focus. Our success in customer acquisition and retention is the result of our investment in relationships over time and the delivery of highly creative and cost-effective solutions. Our list of successful engagements includes well-known customers and high-profile projects.
The time between contract assignment, notice to proceed and completion varies by customer and assignment. As we secure assignments, we accrete our backlog of unbilled revenue and as we execute on assignments, we deplete our backlog of unbilled revenue. We only include funded assignments in our backlog. New and continuing assignments from existing customers, business development efforts and acquisitions fuel the growth of our backlog. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $243 million of gross backlog representing approximately 12 months of trailing gross revenue and a 46% compound annual growth rate from our backlog of $167 million as of December 31, 2021.
We are deliberate about managing risk and therefore limit our exposure by providing professional and related services exclusively. We do not engage in general contracting activities either directly, or through joint ventures, and therefore have no related exposure. We are not a partner in any design-build construction projects, and we carry no inventory other than computers, vehicles and geospatial equipment. Our risk of contract loss is generally limited to the cost of internal labor associated with fixed fee, professional services assignments.
We have substantial experience with acquisitions. Over the past fifteen years, we have successfully completed over 30 acquisitions of engineering and consulting services companies. Through these acquisitions, we have established new geographic footprints, added service lines, increased our depth of leadership, expanded our end markets, and enhanced our portfolio of experience. Our industry is highly fragmented, presenting opportunity to build scale through consolidation. We are continuously active in the market for acquisitions maintaining a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Our acquisition strategy is to identify targets that align with our culture and permit rapid integration rendering the acquired entity’s operations fully consolidated into ours within one year.
McMahon Acquisition
In the second quarter of 2022, we signed a purchase agreement to acquire McMahon Associates, Inc. (“McMahon”), with an effective date of May 4, 2022. McMahon is a company that specializes in transportation planning and engineering based in Fort Washington, PA. We paid total consideration of $18.3 million, which was comprised of 476,796 shares of common stock, at $16.64 per share, for a total of $7.9 million, plus $10.4 million in cash, two promissory notes and assumed liabilities. We believe that the acquisition of McMahon allows us to further enhance our transportation and engineering competencies thereby allowing us to broaden our offerings and better serve our public and private sector customers. 
Competitive Strengths 
We are an agile, growth-oriented engineering services firm committed to providing essential technical and professional services to a broad base of long-term and repeat customers. The recurring needs of our customers for technical services to monetize and operate their assets makes us essential to their ongoing operations. Our commitment to quality and reliability with respect to designs, plans and customer service has enabled us to create durable, long-term customer relationships. We serve several thousand customers with more than 70% having engaged with us in each of the past three years. We deliberately focus many of our business pursuits in environments where laws and regulations create a level of complexity that places a premium on the value of our services, thereby providing us openings to develop new customer loyalty through creative problem solving. Our base of repeat customers and multi-year contracts reduce our customer 
Table of Content

acquisition expenses and provide increased visibility into future revenues, allowing us to make investments confidently to expand and take market share from competitors. We believe our competitive strengths include:
National scale and brand. Our professional staff of nearly 1,600 employees as of December 31, 2022, operate out of 70 offices throughout the United States and one office in Mexico and are licensed in all states within the continental United States. Our scale has helped to create a national brand within our industry associated with quality and timely delivery of technical services. The reputation of our brand allows us to extend existing customer relationships, efficiently attract new customers and recruit and retain a credentialed and representative workforce. The strategic locations of our offices support broad recruiting capabilities while the integrated nature of our technology enables flexible remote work and efficient cross-utilization of both technical experience and production resources thereby reducing inefficiency and enhancing profitability. Our diversified geography increases our sources of revenue and income, thereby insulating us from concentrated economic or political disruptions.
Resilient, low-risk business model. We believe that the market for the engineering and related technical services that we perform is generally resilient to long-lasting economic cyclicality and that our specific business model results in lower risk relative to many of our competitors. Our revenue is not concentrated with any customer, geography, end market, or service line. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our top 10 customers represented 18% and 26%, respectively, of our net service billing (a non-GAAP metric – See Management Discussion and Analysis for a reconciliation of non-GAAP results). Our largest expense is labor, which can be adaptively aligned with changing market conditions. We operate an asset-light model that leverages advanced design, data analytics and geospatial technologies to enhance the productivity of our mobile and adaptable workforce. We further control risk by working with established, credit worthy customers. Our focus on long-term and multi-year assignments results in a significant backlog of contracted work providing reliable visibility to near and mid-term revenue that enable us to proactively anticipate and adjust staff needs. Additionally, we limit our financial risk by not engaging in general contracting activities, exposing ourselves to substantial construction risk or posting construction related bid or performance bonds.
Dedicated founder, experienced leadership team, valuable technical workforce, and entrepreneurial culture. Gary Bowman has led our Company since its founding in 1995. In his position as President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bowman sets the Company’s vision, guides the establishment of its strategic objective, and leads its executive team. Mr. Bowman’s institutional knowledge, connection with our customers, and engagement with our staff is rooted in over 40 years of experience in our industry. As our largest stockholder, Mr. Bowman is committed to actively leading the Company and maintaining a substantial ownership position. Our senior executive team is highly experienced, with an average tenure of over 35 years in their respective areas of responsibility. The team has a proven record of accomplishment with respect to driving organic growth, executing, and integrating acquisitions, implementing internal controls, and managing regulatory compliance. The members of our board of directors are all highly accomplished senior executives with extensive private and public business experience.
We have a highly technical workforce of nearly 1,600 employees, as of December 31, 2022, of which approximately 33% hold professional certifications from various industry and regulatory bodies. Our dedication to growth of opportunity for our employees has enabled us to attract and retain exceptional talent. We have built an organization uniformly aligned in its mission, values, purpose, and goals. Our promotion of a culture of ownership through our various equity incentive programs distinguishes us from our peers and improves our ability to attract, energize and retain employees. We embody a set of cultural values that promote entrepreneurship, personal growth, and responsible freedom. We are committed to advancing diversity and inclusion in our workforce.
Proven ability to grow both organically and through acquisition. Over the past ten years, our annual revenues have grown roughly five-fold to approximately $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have accelerated our growth organically through investments in expansion of our capacity and ability to share work across the company, our breadth of services and our geographic footprint, along with a commitment to cross selling and business development. We have also grown acquisitively by identifying and closing acquisitions of companies with workforces that align with our culture and provide revenue synergies for our existing operations. Fundamental to our successful record of growth has been our leadership team’s ability to identify, execute and integrate strategic acquisitions whereby we expand into new geographies, add new capabilities to generate organic growth and extend our industry-leading platform. Our acquisition integration approach rapidly facilitates cross-cultivation of experiences, employee collaboration and cross selling of services. Historically, within a year’s time, most of our acquired companies become fully integrated within our overall operations.

Industry Overview 
Our operations encompass nearly every aspect of the U.S. domestic built environment. We provide planning, engineering, construction management, commissioning, environmental consulting, geospatial, survey, land procurement and other technical consulting services to customers that 1) develop and manage the infrastructure supporting places where people live, work, play and learn; 2) build and operate the systems that manage and distribute vital life services such as water, electricity, and other critical utilities; 3) manage the roads, bridges, and transportation systems used to get from place to place; 3) maintain the ports and other marine facilities used to transport and distribute goods; 4) advance technologies that provide clean energy, energy transition and decarbonization initiatives; and 5) promote public health and safety every day. Our public sector customers include government agencies (federal, state, and local), military branches, educational institutions, transportation departments, water authorities and other general infrastructure managers. Our private sector customers include owners and operators from multiple industries such as investor-owned utilities, participants in the renewable energy marketplace, owners of data centers, developers and owners of residential and commercial real estate, operators of big-box and convenience retail chains, mine operators and others.
The market for engineering services in the United States is large, with an expected total revenue of $360 billion in 2023, according to IBISWorld. With over 130,000 firms, a large proportion of whom are small-scale organizations focused on specific local markets or specialized niches, the industry is extremely fragmented. As reported in Engineering News-Record, the 500 largest firms in our industry generated approximately $89 billion in revenue in 2021 within the United States, with the ten largest firms accounting for $56 billion of that revenue. Modor Intelligence projects the US domestic engineering services market will register a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.75% from 2022 to 2027.
As with most fragmented industries with extensive participation of privately held companies, there is an active market for ownership transition and consolidation activity with larger participants actively engaging in growth through acquisitions. The technical complexity and financial risks associated with designing most projects performed in the industry effectively restricts the free flow of new entrants, limiting participation to those with demonstrated capacities across a range of projects. Qualifications, sophisticated technical skills, expertise, financial resources, and scale are prerequisites for successful industry participation. Companies aspiring to enter the market must have sufficient skilled human capital to complete complex projects, and the financial resources to provide adequate risk management and cover working capital and professional insurance requirements. These factors serve as both a barrier to entry and a catalyst for consolidation. 
Our Markets 
We have strategically and deliberately diversified the markets that we serve to reduce our dependence on any single market segment and to dampen the effects of business cycles in our markets. While we are bullish on all the market spaces that we currently serve, we intend to especially focus our growth initiatives on markets that possess the following characteristics: 
•High potential for reoccurring revenue and multi-year assignments 
•Engagement with renewable energy, energy transition, and energy efficiency activities 
•Aging and failing infrastructure in need of upgrade and replacement 
•Transformational investment paradigms such as privatization 
•Economic vitality and attractive growth in population and workforce
•Long-term public sector funding 
•Regulatory complexity 
The markets we serve typically require participants to engage with several of our services, affording us the opportunity to cross sell, optimize revenue potential, and differentiate ourselves as a single source supplier. 
We have a significant presence in each of the following markets we currently serve:
Transportation
We believe the utilization of transportation infrastructure within the domestic built environment far exceeds its intended capacity. The aging of the current installed transportation base and increasing load usage are forcing public authorities to invest in repairs, increase the capacity of their systems or privatize the operation of their roads, bridges, and tollways. The transportation market has experienced broad increases in federal funding from U.S. Department of Transportation initiatives as well as explosive for-profit privatization. The Federal Highway Administration has estimated that nearly a quarter of the nation’s bridges are deficient and require replacement or rehabilitation.
Table of Content

We believe that economic and population growth in major metropolitan areas will drive demand for spending on expanded roadway capacity. The American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”) Infrastructure Report Card rated the state of the U.S. Highway system as “D+” and estimates spending requirements of over $2.5 trillion over ten years on U.S. surface transportation infrastructure. Providing construction management and design services to departments of transportation and toll authorities has been a proven and dependable source of multi-year and reoccurring revenue.
We serve transportation customers that include Ferrovial, Florida Department of Transportation, Illinois Department of Transportation, Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, Texas Department of Transportation, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority, Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Virginia Department of Transportation and others.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Transportation represented 17.1% and 11.0%, respectively, of our gross contract revenue.
Power and Utilities 
We believe that much of the power, gas, and water infrastructure in the U.S. has reached or passed its useful life span. Major power outages due to increasingly severe weather events is a growing problem which the Department of Energy estimates is costing the U.S. at least $150 billion per year. The Electric Power Research Institute estimated the cost to move the U.S. to a smarter national grid with better protection against major outages to be somewhere between $338 billion and $476 billion. Utilities, policy makers, and communities have agreed for years that the aging electric transmission and distribution grid in the U.S. needs to be substantially upgraded to withstand the challenges of the future. The U.S. power grid faces unrelenting pressure to increase resiliency and to integrate technologies such as electric vehicles, distributed generation, and battery storage, as well as to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure. The proliferation of data centers, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence with its associated electrical demand is straining the U.S. power grid and creating a sense of urgency around maintenance and upgrade. According to the Infrastructure Report Card, the U.S. electric infrastructure will require capital investment of $637 billion over the next ten years. 
Degradation of the safety and sustainability of natural gas distribution systems is advancing the infusion of public investment and private, returns-driven capital. The entrance of private capital into the historically public utility market, and the associated timely demand for return on investment, has catalyzed the pace of multi-year expenditures on critical infrastructure. As reported by The Council of State Governments, natural gas utilities spend $19 billion annually to enhance the safety of the natural gas system. Examples of our multi-year reoccurring revenue assignments in the utilities space include undergrounding of electric distribution lines, procurement of rights-of-way and easements, gas distribution system mapping, and design for gas distribution pipeline replacement. We serve end clients in the power and utility space such as AEP, Dominion Energy, Florida Power and Light, Lower Colorado River Authority, NiSource Columbia Gas, Southwest Gas, Peoples Gas of Illinois, and Tampa Electric. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Power and Utilities represented 12.5% and 15.0%, respectively, of our gross contract revenues. 
Building Infrastructure
Encompassing all the places we live, sleep, work, shop, and play, the building infrastructure market is foundationally aligned with all day-to-day factors that are either influenced by or influence economic activity. Fueled by changing population demographics and evolving remote work dynamics, the market for design, construction and maintenance of new and renewed building infrastructure presents us with continually expanding opportunities. With respect to building infrastructure, we are agnostic as to the end use of the site we are planning. Our business is one of inventory creation, not of land development or construction of structures. Recent interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve Bank have, however, introduced an element of uncertainty as to the continued growth of the market for residential building infrastructure.
Commercial and Retail. Changes in shopping and consuming habits spurred by e-commerce, accelerated by stay-at-home trends and orders have, in our belief, resulted in a massive reconfiguration of commercial and retail physical plant along with the configuration of their surrounding site elements. Brands are rushing to adapt their customer engagements as a result of fundamental changes in consumption patterns arising from the pandemic experience. As an example, a large coffee shop chain as part of an initiative to “increase convenience-led formats” in the U.S. including both drive-thru and curbside pickup options, closed 400 traditional locations in North America while adding 300 net new convenience-oriented locations throughout North America in their place. We believe savvy and well capitalized developers and operators in this

market will continue to demand our services in response to evolving market forces. We serve national retailers such as Chick-fil-A, Chipotle, Circle K, Starbucks, Dutch Bros Coffee, Whataburger, and others.
Residential. More than a decade into the recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, household formation continues while home sales have yet to recover fully from pre-recession highs. According to IBISWorld, the land development industry represents a market valued at roughly $11.7 billion annually. Within the residential market there are fundamentally three sub-markets we address: 1) for-sale residential housing; 2) multi-family rental housing, and 3) mixed-use and urban cluster developments. Common to each of these sub-markets is the long lead time for the planning, design and approval of land inventory. The process of land inventory creation for residential use involves entitlement, environmental impact analysis, preliminary infrastructure planning and final layout. Each phase in the process involves public scrutiny and input along with regulatory review and approval. Land use entitlements for residential use are often flexible with respect to the ownership structure of the dwellings constructed, thereby allowing landowners to adapt to highest and best use throughout economic cycles and consumer preferences. Rising interest rates can negatively impact demand for fee-simple, for-sale housing but they do not necessarily impact the demand for household formation and the need for new housing stock. Our history serving the residential market goes back to our beginning and we work for most of the large national homebuilders including Lennar Homes, NV Homes, Richmond American Homes, and Toll Brothers.
Institutional and Government. As our economy and population grows, the market to construct new, expanded, and modernized government facilities, schools, state-of-the-art educational institutions, military installations, and mission critical complexes expands continuously. State and local governments experience increasing demand from their constituents for safe, efficient, and environmentally friendly facilities. Evolving demographics and associated demands for municipal and recreational services are increasing the need for new and updated government infrastructure. Communities are placing a growing emphasis of focus on environmental impact and sustainability as seen through the implementation of smart- and green-building technologies in new and retrofit facilities. As the economy adapts to a post-pandemic state, we have experienced increased demand for retrofits of ventilation, air handling, air quality monitoring, and filtration systems in order to ensure healthier indoor environments necessary to mitigate the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. We have served institutional and government clients such as American University, George Washington University, GSA, INOVA Health System, Loudoun County Schools, National Reconnaissance Office, New Jersey Institute of Technology, O’Hare International Airport, Rutgers University, Smithsonian Institution, U.S. Army, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and others.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Building infrastructure represented 65.1% and 70.2%, respectively, of our gross contract revenue.
We are engaged in activities in each of the following markets which we consider to be emerging opportunities.
Renewable Energy
Renewable energy encompasses all activities supporting the energy sector’s transition away from fossil-based systems of energy production in favor of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, as well as lithium-ion batteries. According to Wood Mackenzie, (i) wind and solar will increase three-fold over twenty years to account for 30% of U.S. power generation by the year 2040, (ii) electric vehicle units will increase from 11 million to 323 million by the year 2040, supplanting traditional gas and diesel vehicles in the process, and (iii) the U.S. will need to invest one trillion dollars per year in new energy capacity over 20 years to meet the demands of economic growth and energy transition. In its report, Renewables 2020—Analysis and forecast to 2025, the International Energy Agency predicts that renewables are expected to account for 95% of the net increase in global power capacity through 2025. During that period, the share of renewables in electricity generation is forecast to grow from 27% in 2020 to 33% in 2025. Furthermore, during the 2020-2025 forecast period, combined wind and solar capacity is expected to double, achieving two important milestones: their total installed capacity is expected to surpass that of natural gas by 2024 and that of coal by 2025. During that time, Business Wire reports an annual growth rate estimate of more than 15% for the highly fragmented United States solar energy market alone.
Limited natural resources, increasing demand, and disruptive innovation are driving consequential private and public investment in the expansion of renewable energy facilities. Increasing demand for industrial grade renewable infrastructure and expanded capacity within existing facilities create an exceptional depth of opportunity for the sale of our services. We provide planning, environmental consulting, land procurement, civil and electrical engineering, and program management services to customers in the renewable and decarbonization energy space.
Table of Content

We serve solar developers, wind developers, and battery storage developers in the renewable energy space such as AEP Renewables, Broadreach Power, Dominion Energy, First Solar, Onyx Renewable Partners, Rynova, Samsung C&T America, Solis Energy, S-Power, and Sun Tribe Power, and others.
Energy Efficiency
Recent acquisitions have provided us the capability and reputation needed to enter the energy efficiency market. Energy efficiency plays a pivotal role in advancing sustainable development within the global economy. Efforts to decarbonize the global energy system and advance the world’s climate objectives are dependent on improving energy efficiency. Technologies and applications such as distributed generation, microgrids, the internet of things, energy as a service, and cogeneration are transforming how we produce, distribute, and consume energy.
As an example of the growth potential of this market, Fortune Business Insights forecasted the global market for the energy-as-a-service market to grow at a compound growth rate of about 12% over seven years. The research firm of Markets and Markets forecasts that the global market for microgrids will grow at a compound growth rate of about 10% over five years. We view the energy efficiency market as one that is synergistic with the renewable energy market as well as the power and utilities market. Consequently, we intend to focus much of our acquisition effort and resources in this direction.
Water Resources
Water is essential to our lives and our communities, making it critical that we create a sustainable future for our water supply. Balancing the world’s needs for safe, reliable water with protection of this critical natural resource for the future requires a deep understanding of multiple interconnected systems. As water supplies become scarce and in increasing need of protection, and infrastructure needs increase contemporaneously, we collaborate with our customers to develop sustainable solutions to their water, wastewater, and water resources challenges. Our team of water professionals provides water supply distribution and treatment, wastewater collection and treatment, and asset management engineering and consulting services to customers. Rapid urbanization, industrial growth, suburban sprawl, and depleting sources of fresh water are increasing domestic demand for water and wastewater solutions. Expanding regulations governing the treatment, distribution and storage of water resources will intensify demand for adaptive water and wastewater treatment solutions. We assist municipalities, county agencies, public utilities, and private clients in addressing their potable water and wastewater challenges. Our expertise with water solutions ranges from planning, design, construction management, and funding identification. We serve the water resource needs of a variety of customers including the U.S. Navy, Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Fairfax County Water Authority, Loudoun Water, and others.
Mining
Mining facilities require a variety of the general and specialty engineering services we provide. We serve the Southwest U.S. copper mining industry where we have developed specialized capabilities over time. Copper is buoyed by both near and long-term favorable fundamentals. Policy driven decarbonization targets are accelerating and copper is a critical component for electric vehicles, charging stations, high-efficiency motors, and renewable energy. According to the International Copper Association, electric vehicles use up to four times as much copper as internal combustion vehicles and renewable energy power generation uses four to five times as much copper as fossil fuel power generation. Copper is crucial for connecting and advancing development of core technologies and smart cities, including artificial intelligence, smart grids, 5G technologies, mobile phones and computers. A study conducted by the Martec group found that the total volume of copper in smart city technology is predicted to rise from 2.7 million tons in 2019 to 4.8 million tons in 2025. Supply of copper is limited due to an aging base supply, limited numbers of in-progress and planned expansion projects, and the substantial time and entitlement challenges for execution of new projects. We also serve customers focused on mining of aggregates which are essential to the construction of roads and other transportation related infrastructure. The demand for mined aggregates is strongly correlated to transportation construction. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, 94% of the materials used in the construction of interstate highways are natural aggregates including crushed stone, sand and gravel. We expect the funding provided by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to stimulate increasing long-term demand for aggregates. We believe our clients are well positioned to benefit from supply constraints facing increasing copper and aggregates demand. Clients in this space that we serve include Freeport McMoRan, Asarco and others.
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, these emerging markets collectively represented 5.3% and 3.8%, respectively, of our gross contract revenue.
Table of Content

Consistent with the overall U.S. and global economies, each of our markets was initially affected adversely in its own way during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our services in all of our markets were considered essential allowing us to continue working uninterrupted. With the passage of time, our markets have steadily rebounded to at or near pre-pandemic levels of activity. 
Growth Strategies 
We continue to focus our efforts on the goal of growing our revenue to become an ENR Top 50 firm within five years of the completion of our initial public offering. We have a long-standing history of robust organic growth rates that are in the upper quartile of industry benchmarks. Our five-fold growth of revenue over the past ten years is comprised of acquisitive growth and organic growth, including significant post-acquisition organic growth in the businesses we have acquired. Two of our universally embraced bedrock cultural values are growth and entrepreneurial spirit. Our commitment to sustaining our unique culture as we continue to expand has been, and will continue to be, fundamental to maintaining an engaged workforce and driving organic growth throughout our organization.
We intend to continue to grow through acquisitions. The current outlook is positive for each of the markets we work in, and we intend to grow aggressively and opportunistically in each of them. To achieve the aggressive growth targets we have established, we plan to focus effort and resources on markets and opportunities with the following characteristics: 
•High potential for reoccurring revenue and multi-year assignments 
•Increasing renewable energy, energy transition and energy efficiency activities 
•Infrastructure in need of upgrade and replacement
•Expanding economic vitality and population
•Geographic and market diversity
•Investment incentives and funding initiatives
•Complex regulatory requirements
These characteristics of market opportunities are fluid, and we may adapt them from time to time to evolving dynamics. We intend to be opportunistic, responsive to evolving macro-economic trends, and evaluate attractive and synergistic opportunities in other markets when they present themselves.
In addition to market expansion, we intend to grow by adding skillsets, service lines and geographic footprints which deepen our market penetration and provide enhanced revenue capture opportunities with our existing and prospective customers. Such strategic and synergistic service line extensions include, but are not limited to, program management, energy management and data management and analytics.
We have built a scalable organizational infrastructure that can accommodate significant growth without a proportionate increase in expense. We have invested time and resources in developing our accounting and financial systems, our management reporting processes, human capital development programs and our information technology infrastructure. As we grow the size and scale of the company, we expect to leverage our investments and general overhead foundation over a larger labor pool, thereby expanding operating margins. 
Organic Growth
We engage all our managers in our commitment to responsible growth by encouraging responsible freedom, entrepreneurial spirit, innovative thinking, and collaborative business development through cross-selling. Our leaders and managers are personally invested in our success through equity participation and incentives that are targeted to reward organic growth and successful execution. As a public company, we intend to use our publicly traded equity to enhance this compensation strategy. Creative use of growth connected and retention-oriented equity incentives along with a commitment to maintaining our core culture are key to the entrepreneurial spirit that will drive our growth. 
Acquisitive Growth
We are actively engaged in discussions with prospective acquisition targets. We plan for acquisitive growth to be the principal way we achieve our goal of becoming an ENR Top 50 firm within five years of having become a publicly traded company. We maintain a full-time, in-house acquisitions, diligence, and integrations teams and have developed a robust network of third-party representatives working on our behalf to identify future acquisition targets that meet our strategic objectives. We maintain a dynamic pipeline driven by general market awareness of our demand for acquisition, existing relationships we have cultivated, and deliberately directed activity of our representatives. We believe that our proven track record, ownership culture, and unyielding commitment to preserving our uniquely entrepreneurial and founder-led culture

as we grow will provide us a competitive edge with acquisition targets as a desirable transaction partner. We generally impose stringent criteria to the evaluation of targets including:
•Advances one or more of our strategic growth objectives
•Provides opportunities for cross-selling additional Bowman services 
•Embodies a culture that is entrepreneurial and compatible with the existing Bowman culture
•Satisfies a robust infrastructure spending need
•Is accretive to our leadership and executive talent pool 
Although we generally apply rigorous financial discipline in the execution of our acquisition program, purchase price is not always the primary deal determinant. We evaluate targets holistically, considering all the factors mentioned above. 
Geographic Expansion
We intend to continue a program of robust geographic expansion. Over the foreseeable future, we plan our geographic footprint to be generally focused on North America including the continental United States, Canada and Mexico. While acquisition will generally be the source of new geographies, we may also establish presence in new geographies by opening new offices. To maintain consistency with our acquisition program, we intend to establish a dynamic list of target metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”) that will serve as focus areas for expansion. General criteria for our target expansion MSAs include: 
•Population scale of one million or greater
•Highly ranked in the Urban Land Institute’s publication Emerging Trends in Real Estate
•Location which complements and/or expands client opportunities
•Availability of high caliber, skilled labor force 
We expect our geographic expansion decision making to be fluid, flexible, opportunistic, and loosely bound by the criteria described above.

Acquisitions 
Acquisitions are a core component of our growth plans. Since becoming a public company, we have successfully completed 17 acquisitions of operating engineering and consulting companies. Our acquisitions activities have added numerous capabilities, services, leadership and customers in addition to expanding our operations throughout the continental United States. Many of the senior leaders in our company today come from companies we acquired both before and after becoming a public company.
We target acquisitions that provide strategic service line extensions, have a geographic footprint complementary to our existing operations or client assignments, demonstrate capacity for profitability with strong potential for organic growth, align with our corporate culture and have management we can develop into leaders within our operations. We pursue opportunities that we can integrate efficiently. We do not intend to maintain multiple brands or stand-alone operations for extended periods post-closing. Our goal is for an acquired company to be fully integrated into our operation within one year of closing. We are cautious about advancing discussions or extending terms until we have ascertained a target is compatible with our culture and thoroughly committed to our strategic direction. We add value to the operations of our acquisitions by providing technical resources and subject matter experts that broaden opportunities with existing customers, technology investment to improve utilization, information systems to support productivity, professional development programs to promote staff engagement, supportive growth-oriented leadership, growth capital, and corporate services that improve client focus and utilization while leveraging overhead through scale.
We are regularly engaged in discussions with acquisition prospects. These discussions range in formality from an initial inquiry to a non-binding letter of intent. 
Recent Acquisitions
Subsequent to September 30, 2022, we have closed on three acquisitions as detailed below. None of these recent acquisitions was individually significant under Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X.
Table of Content

Spatial Acuity. On October 31, 2022, we closed on the purchase of assets and operations of Spatial Acuity, LLC, a professional services firm based in Austin, TX that generated approximately $2.5 million of net service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Spatial Acuity specializes in 3-D imagery, reality capture and geospatial engineering.
SEI. On November 2, 2022, we closed on the purchase of assets and operations of SEI Engineering LLC, a professional services firm based in Paonia, CO that generated approximately $1.5 million of net service revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. SEI specializes in solar energy engineering services.
H2H. On December 2, 2022, we closed on the purchase of assets and operations of H2H Geosciences Engineering PLLC, a professional services firm that generated $3.5 million of gross contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. H2H specializes in hydrology and geosciences engineering services.
We have paid a total of approximately $8.6 million for the closed transactions including 134,042 shares of common stock valued at a total of approximately $2.1 million at an average of $15.45 per share. The remaining consideration was comprised of a combination of cash and seller notes.
Key Customers and Projects 
We currently serve a diverse portfolio of public and private customers, who own, construct, and maintain the built environment. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 70% of our revenue was derived from customers engaged with us in each of the past three years. Our breadth of our customer base diversifies risk, with the ten largest customers we served accounting for approximately 18% and 26% of our net service billing during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We avoid concentration of exposure with no single client accounting for more than 6.0% of our net service revenue during each of these periods. We focus our business development efforts on increasing the proportion of our revenue generated by long-term projects and multi-year contracts. While we anticipate public sector customers will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our revenues for the near future, we intend to continue expanding long-term relationships and multi-year assignments with private sector customers through organic growth and acquisitions. 
Contracts 
We enter into contracts with customers that either cover a single performance obligation consisting of one or more tasks (also referred to as assignments and deliverables) or are open-ended engagements that create a framework for our being retained for more than one discrete performance obligation and task (often referred to as master services agreements). Our contracts contain two principal types of pricing provisions: (1) fixed price, also referred to as lump sum, and (2) hourly, also referred to as time and materials or cost plus. In many cases, a single contract will contain both fixed price and hourly priced tasks. From a financial reporting perspective, a contract is categorized as fixed fee and therefore subjected to percentage completion accounting under Accounting Standards Codification "ASC" Topic 606 if any one task within the contract is priced on a fixed fee basis. For management discussion and analysis purposes, we evaluate the percentages of our revenues that are fixed fee and hourly based on the pricing of each individual task or assignment within our contracts. When we distinguish percentages of revenue based on contracts, we are considering any contract with at least one fixed fee task to be completely characterized as a fixed fee. We believe the percentage allocation relating to assignments is a more accurate assessment of the risk and opportunity associated with our revenue distribution. 
The characteristics of the two contract and task types are as follows:
Hourly contracts and/or assignments are common for professional and technical consulting assignments both short-term and multi-year in duration. Under these types of engagements, there is no predetermined maximum fee, and we generally experience no risk associated with cost overruns. For hourly engagements, we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our customers based upon the actual hours expended toward a deliverable. Direct project expenditures such as subconsultants and other expenses generally pass through to the customer for reimbursement. These engagements may have not-to-exceed parameters requiring us to receive additional authorizations from our customer to continue working but in these cases, we have no obligation to deliver a pre-negotiated result without authorization to continue at additional cost to the customer. Purely hourly contracts for financial reporting purposes do not include any lump sum components as outlined below.
Lump sum contracts and/or assignments typically require the completion of a deliverable for a specified lump-sum or fixed fee, subject to price adjustments if the scope of the assignment changes or unforeseen requirements arise. With lump sum assignments, modified schedules and expansions of scope will likely result in additional fees through change orders issued by our customers. Our fixed fee assignments generally include a specified scope of work and a defined set of 
Table of Content

deliverables. For accounting and financial reporting purposes we classify a contract as fixed fee if any portion of the performance obligation under the contract requires us to complete work outlined in the contract for a pre-determined fixed price. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we derived over 70% and 67%, respectively, of our revenue from lump sum assignments and approximately 23% and 29%, respectively, from hourly assignments. The remainder of our revenue in each year was derived from reimbursements for itemized passthrough items such as consultants and direct expenses. 
Backlog 
We calculate the value of our undelivered gross revenue to measure backlog and predict future revenue. Backlog includes fully awarded and contracted work along with revenue we expect to realize over time for renewable long term and multi-year assignments. To calculate backlog, we assess the gross contract revenue we will recognize in connection with the completion of undelivered near-term and long-term customer commitments. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our gross backlog was comprised as follows: 

 | December 31, 2022 | | December 31, 2021
Building Infrastructure | 51.2 | % | | 62.3 | %
Transportation | 30.6 | % | | 19.0 | %
Power & Utilities | 13.4 | % | | 16.2 | %
Other Emerging Markets | 4.8 | % | | 2.5 | %

We use backlog to determine appropriate staffing levels and predict company revenue growth, both of which typically move accordingly with changes in backlog. Backlog definitions and methods of calculation vary within our industry. As such, backlog is not a reliable metric on which to evaluate us relative to our peers.
As of December 31, 2022 we had approximately $243 million of gross backlog, representing a 45.5% increase as compared to $167 million as of December 31, 2021. The transportation backlog increased to 30.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to 19.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is attributable to our acquisition of McMahon Associates Inc, in 2022, which is part of our growth strategy through acquisitions. For further details, see Note 4, Acquisitions, appearing in Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have experienced growth in our backlog as we have expanded our footprint, increased our client base, and more deeply penetrated our end markets. Despite the general economic and personal effects of COVID-19 on our customers, our markets and our employees, we produced growth in our backlog by virtue of our efforts to secure new commitments that exceeded the reductions that result from gross revenue and cancellations. We believe that our growth in backlog is an indicator of the success of our growth strategies
Marketing and Sales 
We position ourselves as a preferred provider of services to those who own, construct and maintain the built environment. We obtain client engagements primarily through business development efforts targeted at new customers, cross-selling of our services to existing customers, expanding client relationships into new geographies, referrals and social media outreach. We maintain professional marketing and business development staffs that work closely with our managers and leadership to develop strategic, targeted programs for affecting outreach, advancing our brand, developing new opportunities and securing new assignments. 
Consumers of engineering and technical services consistent with ours can be local, regional, and national organizations with projects ranging from a single, quick-turn deliverable to complex long-term assignments and multi-year engagements. By focusing our business development efforts more on long-term assignments and multi-year opportunities in growing end markets, we extend the visibility of future revenue forecasts and reduce the costs and uncertainty associated with backlog depletion and revenue replacement. We expect to continue to see organic growth in sales based on our commitment to delivering the highest quality and most creatively conceived solutions to our customers.
Table of Content

Our business development and marketing efforts emphasize lead generation, industry group networking, project and staff promotion and general corporate visibility. We support our managers’ business development efforts with a seasoned team of marketing professionals embedded throughout our organization working to professionalize every touchpoint with customers, prospects and influencers. We complement our marketing and business development efforts with extensive social media awareness. In addition, we contract for services with a professional public and media relations agency. We are neither engaged with, nor dependent on, traditional paid media advertising.
We actively engage in creating revenue synergy by cross selling our services between clients, geographies and markets. We define cross-selling and revenue synergy as either expanding our relationship with a particular client by providing additional services and expanded geographic coverage or expanding our overall market penetration with respect to a particular service offering by introducing it throughout our national operation. Our acquisitions offer significant cross selling and revenue synergy opportunities which facilitates both acquired and organic growth. As our service offerings continue expanding and we expand our portfolio of services, we anticipate increases in our cross-selling successes. 
Competition 
Our competition varies according to the market, geographical area of the project and the nature and scope of a particular opportunity. The engineering and consulting industry is highly fragmented and characterized by many small and mid-sized companies that focus their operations on regional markets or specialized service niches. On any given opportunity, we compete and/or team with many of the same local, regional and national companies.
Industry participants compete on the strength of client relationships, reputation for quality of service and reliability, expertise in local markets, technical capabilities, and price. While price differentiation remains an important element in competitive bidding and is often the most significant factor in securing public sector contracts, we believe that value, quality, reputation and scale are competitive differentiators that positively affect our ability to win work. The importance of the foregoing factors varies widely based upon the nature, location, and size of the project. On highly complex and sought-after projects, our breadth of services, financial foundation, work-sharing orientation and geographic reach afford us flexibility in pricing and cost estimation. Our ability to provide comprehensive and integrated solutions gives us flexibility when it comes to pricing strategies to meet client budgets and funding limitations. We believe that we benefit from our diversified service offerings and highly skilled, diverse and qualified employees.
Credentials, licensing and the ability to secure and demonstrate sufficient professional liability insurance present significant barriers to entry in the industry. Within the engineering market, scale and breadth of service offerings can also act as a barrier for entry for companies that do not have adequate professional and financial resources to compete for and execute complex, large-scale projects. Customers are increasingly emphasizing safe work practices by placing a premium on limiting liability, thus creating an additional barrier to entry for those who cannot demonstrate and maintain a safety record at or above industry standards. The opportunity and financial cost to customers of delivery delays has a meaningful impact on their willingness to rely on smaller firms. 
It is common for many of the companies we compete with to have greater financial resources, larger national platforms or greater service offerings than we currently have. Factors affecting our ability to win assignments include our marketing effectiveness, our client relationships, our ability to team with larger organizations, our capacity to accurately estimate costs and quantify the quality assurance requirements of the work, our ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel, our ability to deliver timely, and our ability to obtain adequate professional insurance for the work we perform. We believe our positioning enables us to continue winning incrementally larger work assignments that will grow our business. 
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had nearly 1,600 employees, approximately 92% of which are full-time employees and approximately 8% of which represent our non-technical operations staff. Our low total employee attrition rate for 2022 among all staff, part-time and full-time, office and field, was reflective of our commitment to our core values, employee engagement and professional development. Our reputation, aided by our dedicated internal recruiting staff and nationally scaled work-share platform, has afforded us the ability to be successful in locating and engaging with qualified and credentialed employees as needed on an anywhere-anytime basis. We do not expect our growth efforts to be significantly constrained by a lack of qualified personnel or by any geographic limitations. We consider our employee relations to be exceptional and our level of engagement with employees to be high. As of December 31, 2022, our licensed professional staff represented approximately 33% of our workforce.
Table of Content

Approximately 30% of our workforce works outdoors performing geospatial engineering, construction management, land procurement and field surveying. Our professional safety team administers a disciplined compliance routine with complex and comprehensive protocols that lead to fewer accidents, lower costs associated with accidents, lost productivity, and insurance. We have earned a safety record that distinguishes us relative to our competitors.
It is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent to continue to maintain our reputation for delivering high-quality services. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Bowman a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their personal and professional lives. 
Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of underrepresented populations in our industry. We have focused our recent efforts in four areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire diverse talent; advocating and facilitating affinity group engagement; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion and diversity programs. 
Health, Safety and Wellness. Fundamental to the success of our business is our commitment to the safety and well-being of our employees and customers. Accordingly, we dedicate resources to making sure our employees are trained and equipped to carry out their job functions to keep themselves, our customers, and the communities in which we work safe. We provide employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including: 1) benefits that provide protection and security so employees have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact financial well-being; 2) support for physical and mental health through tools, resources and leave policies that help improve or maintain health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and 3) choices where possible, so employees can customize benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented adaptive policies that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This included having many of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We believe that in-person collaboration is a critical component of employee engagement. We have re-opened all our offices and encourage return to work. 
Talent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a leading engineering services provider. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide geographic flexibility, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and implemented “industry-leading” methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent. 
Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, to build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops throughout the company that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and leadership development programs provide an ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We offer employees a breadth of on-line tools that provide quick access to learning resources that are personalized to the individual’s development objectives. 
Regulation 
While our business is not generally subject to significant regulation, the services we provide to our customers address various federal, state and local regulations that must be complied with to receive approval to proceed. With respect to the operation of our business, we are subject to professional licensing and human resources requirements that vary by state.
Each state establishes licensing and organizational requirements for our services. Certain states allow only individuals and individually owned professional services corporations to hold licenses. In those states there may be grandfathering exemptions that allow corporations to hold licenses. In the event a state does not allow a corporation to hold a license, we have in the past, formed professional services corporations owned by Mr. Bowman and other employees to facilitate our ability to work in such states. To the extent we cannot adequately satisfy a state’s licensing requirements, we do not operate in that state. As of December 31, 2022, we were licensed to operate in all states within the continental United States either directly or through an affiliate.
We must comply with laws and regulations relating to government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers and may impose added costs on our business. In connection with the process of bidding for and being 
Table of Content

awarded certain government assignments we are required to provide an annual Federal Acquisition Regulation rate audit that determines our overhead reimbursement allowance. Some significant laws and regulations that affect us include: 
•federal, state, and local laws and regulations (including the Federal Acquisition Regulation or “FAR”) regarding the formation, administration, and performance of government contracts 
•the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval
•federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding procurement integrity including gratuity, bribery and anti-corruption requirements as well as limitations on political contributions and lobbying. 
Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in contract termination, damage to our reputation, price or fee reductions, suspension, or debarment from contracting with the government, each of which could have a materially adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, federal, state, and local government entities may revise existing contract rules and regulations or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time and may also face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and number of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are subject to recompete.
We must comply with several laws that strictly regulate the handling, removal, treatment, transportation and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous materials. CERCLA and comparable state laws typically impose strict joint and several liabilities without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of hazardous substances. The liability for the entire cost of clean-up could be imposed upon any responsible party. Other principal federal environmental, health, and safety laws affecting us include, among others, the Resource Conversation and Recovery Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act. Our business operations may also be subject to similar state and international laws relating to environmental protection. Liabilities related to environmental contamination or human exposure to hazardous substances, or a failure to comply with applicable regulations, could result in substantial costs to us, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, or cessation of remediation activities. Our continuing work in the areas governed by these laws and regulations exposes us to the risk of substantial liability. To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
