We design, develop, manufacture, sell and support FullMAX, our patented, Software Defined Radio (“SDR”) platform for secure, licensed, private, wide-area broadband networks. Our customers install FullMAX systems in order to upgrade and expand their legacy wide-area network infrastructure. Our MC-IoT intellectual property has been adopted by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (“IEEE”), the leading worldwide standards body in data networking protocols, and forms the core of the IEEE 802.16s standard. Because standards-based communications solutions are preferred by our mission-critical customers and ecosystem partners, we have taken a leadership position in IEEE as it relates to wireless networking for industrial markets. As such, management believes this standards-based approach supports the adoption of our technology across a burgeoning ecosystem of global partners and end markets.



Our software-based FullMAX platform is an important and timely upgrade solution for privately-owned and operated wireless wide-area networks, leveraging Internet Protocol-based communications to provide more reliability and data capacity for our mission-critical infrastructure customers. We believe industrial and critical infrastructure markets throughout the globe have reached an inflection point where legacy serial and analog based protocols and network transport systems no longer meet industry needs. In addition to offering enhanced data throughput, FullMAX is an intelligent networking platform enabling the adoption of sophisticated operating systems and equipment supporting next-generation MC-IoT applications over wide field areas. These new MC-IoT applications and related equipment require more processing power at the edge of large industrial networks and the efficient utilization of network capacity and scarce bandwidth resources which can be supported by the “Fog-computing” capability integrated in our end-to-end network platform. Fog-computing utilizes management software to enable edge compute processing and data and application prioritization in the field enabling our customers more reliable, real-time operating control of these new, intelligent MC-IoT equipment and applications at the edge.



Ondas Autonomous Systems



Our Ondas Autonomous Systems business unit designs, develops, and markets commercial drone solutions via the Optimus System™ and Scout System™ (the “Autonomous Drone Platforms”).



The Autonomous Drone Platforms are highly automated, AI-powered drone systems capable of continuous, remote operation and are marketed as “drone-in-a-box” turnkey data solution services. They are deployed for critical industrial and government applications where data and information collection and processing are required. These use cases include public safety, security and smart city deployments where routine, high-resolution automated emergency response, mapping, surveying, and inspection services are highly valued, in addition to industrial markets such as oil & gas, rail and ports which emphasize security and inspection solutions. The Autonomous Drone Platforms are typically provided to customers under a Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) business model, while some customers will choose to purchase and own and operate an Optimus Systems™.



American Robotics and Airobotics have industry leading regulatory successes which include having the first drone system approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) for automated operation beyond-visual-line-of-sight (BVLOS) without a human operator on-site.



In addition to the Autonomous Drone Platforms, we also offer a counter-drone system called the Raider™. The Raider was developed by Iron Drone and is deployed by government and enterprise customers to provide security and protect critical infrastructure, assets and people from the threat of hostile drones. Ondas Holdings acquired Iron Drone on March 6, 2023.



Autonomous Drone Platforms 



We design, develop and manufacture autonomous drone systems, providing high-fidelity, ultra-high-resolution aerial data to enterprise and government customers. We currently prioritize the marketing of our Optimus System™ which provides customers with a turnkey data and information solution and the ability to continuously digitize, analyze, and monitor their assets and field operations in real-time or near real-time. We believe the market opportunity for our Scout System™ remains significant. As we drive market adoption with the Optimus platform, we anticipate re-introducing the Scout platform including newly enhanced versions to help segment the market for different use cases and price points.



The Optimus System™ has been designed from the ground up as an end-to-end product capable of continuous unattended operations in the real world. Powered by innovations in robotics automation, machine vision, edge computing, and AI. Once installed in the field at customer locations, a fleet of connected Optimus Systems™, which are often deployed as networked drone infrastructure, which we refer to as Urban Drone Infrastructure, remains indefinitely positioned in an area of operation, automatically collecting and seamlessly delivering data and information regularly and reliably.





2







We market the Optimus System™ under a DaaS business model, whereby our drone platform aggregates customer data and provides the data analytics meeting customer requirements in return for an annual subscription fee. Some customers purchase Optimus Systems™ to own and operate themselves. We also engage distributors to assist in the sales and marketing of our Optimus System™ in geographic markets where its more cost effective to identify and service potential customers by engaging local third parties. These distribution agreements can include joint ventures, where Ondas Autonomous Systems will provide technical expertise to support the joint venture partner in the provision of aerial data services to customers.



The Optimus System™ consists of (i) Optimus™, a highly automated, AI-powered drone with advanced imaging payloads, (ii) the Airbase™, a ruggedized weatherproof base station for housing, battery swapping, battery charging, payload swapping, data processing, and cloud transfer, and (iii) Insightful™, a secure web portal and API which enables remote interaction with the system, data, and resulting analytics anywhere in the world. These major subsystems are connected via a host of supporting technologies. Airbase™ has internal robotic systems that enable the automated swapping of batteries and payloads. Automated battery swapping allows for 24/7 operation of Optimus as the Optimus drone can immediately be redeployed after returning to the dock for a battery swap. Similarly, the ability to autonomously swap sensors and advanced payloads without human intervention allows for the Optimus System™ to provide multiple applications and use cases from a single location.



American Robotics and Airobotics have industry leading regulatory successes which include having the first drone system approved by the FAA for automated operation BVLOS without a human operator or visual observer on-site. American Robotics’ FAA approvals were enabled by integrating a suite of proprietary technologies, including Detect-and-Avoid (“DAA”) and other proprietary intelligent safety systems into its autonomous drone platform, which we plan to integrate into the Optimus System™. Airobotics is in the advanced stages of receiving approval for Type Certification (“TC”) from the FAA for the Optimus UAV. TC approval will enable expanded operation for the Optimus System™ in the United States including flight operations in populated areas.



The Raider™



The Raider™ is a counter-drone system, which was designed and developed by Iron Drone, that we are marketing to government and enterprise customers who can utilize the system for security and the protection of critical infrastructure, assets and people from the threat of hostile drones. A typical Raider™ deployment location would include sensitive locations such as borders, stadiums or schools, or near critical assets such as power plants and military bases, and for high profile locations such as amusement parks or where public events are held.



The Raider™ is designed to detect, track and intercept unauthorized, or hostile unmanned aircraft and is most often sold with three small UAVs that are housed in a docking station. The Raider UAV has live video capability and a payload containing a net that can be deployed to intercept a hostile drone. Upon detection of an unauthorized drone, one or more Raider™ UAVs can be autonomously deployed at high speeds to track the unauthorized aircraft. If the unauthorized aircraft is deemed hostile, the Raider™ UAV can deploy the netting to physically intercept the aircraft. A parachute integrated with the netting allows the intercepted drone to safely fall to the ground for collection by our customer.



Partnership with Siemens



In April 2020, Ondas Networks entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens Mobility (“Siemens”), a worldwide leader in seamless, sustainable, reliable and secure transportation solutions for more than 160 years, to both market our FullMAX-based networking technology and services and to jointly develop wireless communications products for the North American Rail Industry based on Siemens’ Advanced Train Control System (“ATCS”) protocol and our FullMAX MC-IoT platform.





3







We believe Siemens has both the sales and marketing reach and support to drive our technology to wide scale acceptance across the global rail market beginning with the North American Class I Railroad market. In the third quarter of 2021 we completed the development of our first jointly-developed product with Siemens – the dual-mode ATCS/MC-IoT radio systems. Siemens is now marketing and selling these proprietary systems under the brand name Airlink to our railroad customers. The dual-mode ATCS radio systems support Siemens’ extensive installed base of ATCS radios as well as offer Siemens’ customers the ability to support a host of new advanced rail applications utilizing our MC-IoT wireless system. These new applications, including Advanced Grade Crossing Activation and Monitoring, Wayside Inspection, Railcar Monitoring and next generation signaling and train control systems, are designed to increase railroad productivity, reduce costs and improve safety. In addition, Siemens markets and sells Ondas Networks’ standalone MC-IoT 802.16 products under the Siemens Airlink brand.



Our relationship with Siemens has expanded significantly since entering into the partnership both with (i) the wider marketing of our wireless technology platform and (ii) multiple additional joint-product programs. Siemens has expanded its marketing reach of Ondas Networks products with identified opportunities in North American Transit Rail as well as in European and Asian Rail markets. We believe our technology has broad potential in these large, newly targeted markets.



In November 2021, Siemens secured its first commercial 900 MHz rail order for a major Class I Railroad in the United States which was delivered in December 2021. In August 2022, we announced that we had secured an initial volume order from Siemens for the Class I Rail 900 MHz Network consisting of both ATCS compatible products along with Ondas’ catalog products. In September 2022, we received government authorization to sell ATCS radios in Canada.



Our Strategy



Our goal is to be a global leader in providing turnkey data solutions for industrial, public safety and government markets by offering i) secure wireless connectivity solutions enabling high-bandwidth, mission-critical Industrial Internet applications and services through Ondas Networks and ii) automated commercial drone services through Ondas Autonomous Systems.



The acquisition of Airobotics was a transformative event for Ondas. Our strategy will emphasize realizing the financial and strategic benefits of combining American Robotics and Airobotics under the Ondas Autonomous Systems business unit. We believe this combination will allow us to accelerate revenue generation and allow us to operate more cost efficiently. The revenue benefits come via expanded global sales and marketing which is significantly enhanced by introducing the Optimus System™ to the US market via our American Robotics customer and field operations staff. Cost efficiencies can be realized via these global sales efforts, elimination of redundant R&D efforts, and through the integration of our product development and engineering teams focused on a single product roadmap. 



The key elements of our growth strategy include the following: 




● | Deliver multiple North American Class I Railroad network opportunities through our FullMAX platform. Our marketing and business development efforts combined with our exclusive strategic partnership with Siemens has generated the potential for significant sales in our targeted end markets. We expect large-scale commercial adoption of our network technology by the North American Class 1 Railroad operators in the newly awarded 900 MHz frequency band. We received an initial volume purchase for commercial deployment in August 2022 from Siemens. Ondas and Siemens together are working with our railroad customers on commercial deployment strategies which we expect will significantly increase purchase orders for equipment and services in the North American Class I Rail markets with expansion plans into passenger and transit markets. In addition, together with Siemens, we are marketing our FullMAX platform as an upgrade for both the 450 MHz HOT network and the legacy 160 MHz voice-centric networks owned and operated by the North American Class 1 Railroad operators.

Our Business Model



Ondas Networks 



We sell our FullMAX MC-IoT wireless products and services globally through a direct sales force and value-added sales partners to industrial and critical infrastructure providers including major rail operators, commercial and industrial drone operators, electric and gas utilities, water and wastewater utilities, oil and gas producers and pipeline operators, and for other critical infrastructure applications in areas such as public safety, homeland security and defense, and transportation. We continue to develop our value-added reseller relationships which today include a strategic partnership with Siemens for the development of new types of wireless connectivity for the North American Rail market as well as selected global markets in both Europe and Asia. We believe our Siemens’ partnership is indicative of the potential for additional Tier 1 partnerships in our other vertical markets including securing reseller relationships with major suppliers to the worldwide government and homeland security markets. To that end, in 2022, we expanded our relationship with Israel Aerospace Industries’ (IAI) Elta division to deliver wireless solutions for the Integrated Coastal Surveillance markets in the Caribbean and India.



In executing our go-to-market strategy, we intend to monetize our software-based intellectual property and grow revenue and cash flow with embedded FullMAX software sales, Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) arrangements, IP royalties based on Ondas Networks software and through additional services provided to customers and ecosystem partners. Customers deploy our connectivity and Fog-computing platform in private networks that are designed for lifetimes of 10 – 15 years or even longer. Our FullMAX platform is software-defined and offers customers flexibility to expand capacity and evolve network utilization. Similarly, our ecosystem partners often integrate our FullMAX software and wireless capability into their own long-lived equipment and systems which their customers purchase and deploy. As such, we believe our software solutions provide ongoing revenue opportunities related to both connectivity value and edge computing capability. Customers and ecosystem partners will require ongoing FullMAX system and security enhancements and for us to design additional features which create opportunities for additional, recurring revenue and profit streams. Our monetization strategies include:



Systems sales: Our FullMAX deployments are typically large, mission-critical wide-area networks deployed and privately operated by our industrial and government customers. These end-to-end system deployments involve sales consisting of both base stations and edge radio end points with embedded FullMAX software and network management software and tools.





5







Software and hardware maintenance agreements: Our customers contract with us for extended software and hardware maintenance which provide them with critical ongoing support for their installed network. These SaaS contracts provide revenue to us in the year following an initial installation. Software maintenance licenses entitle the customer to ongoing software and security upgrades as well as enabling the provision of additional system features. Similarly, hardware maintenance programs provide customers extended equipment warranty terms for an installed network. These SaaS maintenance arrangements allow our customers to continue to maintain a modern, flexible and upgradeable network over a long period of time. These agreements may extend for multiple years given the long average life of the installed and growing network.



Licensing / Royalties: In certain system deployments, our ecosystem partners will choose to embed FullMAX software into their own hardware and software platforms providing us with an ongoing per device multi-year revenue stream. Licensing is an effective way for an ecosystem partner to jumpstart customer activity. Alternatively, a partner may choose to develop software based on our intellectual property generating royalty revenue.



Other Services: We provide ancillary services directly related to the sale of our wireless communications products which include wireless network design, systems engineering, radio frequency planning, software configuration, product training, installation, and onsite support. Furthermore, we also provide engineering and product development services to ecosystem partners who are interested in integrating their intelligent equipment with our FullMAX SDR platform and need our expertise to do so.



Ondas Autonomous Systems



Ondas Autonomous Systems markets its Optimus System™ drone platform via a direct sales force to enterprise and government customers. We focus on identifying and qualifying large, sophisticated customers with active drone programs who have the ability and intent to expand those programs and eventually deploy fleets of automated drones across their portfolio of assets. After initial customer qualification, contracting and the receipt of a purchase order, we ship and install the Optimus System™ on the customer premises. Our field service personnel remain on location for a short period of time to ensure the programmed automated drone operations are meeting customer requirements.



Our Optimus System™ and the services provided via the autonomous drone platform can typically be acquired by customers under several arrangements ranging from Data-as-a-Service (“DaaS”) agreements to a full, outright sale of an Optimus System™.




● | Under a DaaS agreement where we bundle hardware, software, operations, and maintenance into one annual subscription fee. We install an Optimus System on premises and one or multiple customers can procure services. For example, on a construction site, Airobotics can provide aerial data services via and Optimus System™ for security and safety applications, in addition to monitoring and inspection use cases. In many instances, multiple customers will subscribe for each unique service. The DaaS model is the most typical agreement we have with customers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Optimus System™ and services can also be provided to end customers via partnerships or joint ventures with third party drone services providers. Under these arrangements, Airobotics sells an Optimus System™ to the drone services provider for an upfront payment. Airobotics and the drone services provider then enter into an agreement to share in the revenues that the system generates via the provision of aerial data services to end customers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customers can also purchase an Optimus System™ whereby they would own and operate the system. Purchases of Optimus typically come with ongoing services for maintenance. System purchases can be preferred by certain public safety and homeland security customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Airobotics is in the advanced stages of receiving approval for Type Certification (“TC”) from the FAA for the Optimus UAV. TC approval will enable expanded operation for the Optimus System™ in the United States including flight operations in populated areas. The significance of TC approval was highlighted by the FAA decision in April 21, 2021, to amend Part 107 rules which defined new conditions for Drone flights above people and enables night flight. The new regulations define four categories of Drones and clarify that small UAS (“sUAS”) such as the Optimus drone which are below a certain weight will be permitted to conduct flights above populated areas without receiving a specific certificate of Part 107 waiver for systems that have TC designations.



We also market The Raider™, the counter-drone system designed and developed by Iron Drone, a unit within Ondas Autonomous Systems. The Raider™ is targeted towards government and enterprise customers who can utilize the system for security and the protection of critical infrastructure, assets and people from the threat of hostile drones. The Raider™ was formally launched and available to customers in March 2022. We offer this product directly to customers and we intend to broaden the sales & marketing of the Raider™ with distribution through value-added resellers and partners in the future.



Our Products and Services



Ondas Networks



Ondas Networks has developed a next-generation radio platform specifically to meet the evolving data needs of large industrial and government customers and markets.  These markets are differentiated from consumer markets in that the customers assets are dispersed over very wide and remote geographies with specific challenges to installation, maintenance, and upgrades. These challenges led us to design a new type of software-based radio platform capable of supporting a long useful life to the network hardware.  Instead of using low cost, off the shelf, dedicated communications chipsets (“ASICs”), we selected powerful programmable embedded general-purpose processors, DSPs, and FPGAs, all of which are software upgradable. Our software defined radio (“SDR”) architecture, with more than 12 years in development and supported by a team of over 50 software engineers, allows us to customize almost any aspect of the air interface protocol, the key components of which are patented and have been incorporated into new IEEE wireless standards. The ability to constantly improve customer networks and hosted software applications with flexible, over-the-air software upgrade helps create customer loyalty and creates high switching costs.



Our FullMAX SDR platform is designed to enable highly secure and reliable industrial-grade connectivity for truly mission-critical applications. An end-to-end FullMAX network consists of connected wireless base stations, fixed and mobile edge radios and supporting technology all enabled by critical software developed and owned by Ondas Networks. The Fog-computing capability integrated in our end-to-end FullMAX SDR platform is valued by our customers and ecosystem partners as they seek to leverage the value of MC-IoT applications for improved safety, efficiency, and profitability. Our IEEE 802.16s compliant equipment is designed to optimize the performance of unused or underutilized low frequency licensed radio spectrum and narrower channels. We do this through various patented software algorithms including via “spectrum harvesting” techniques which aggregate narrowband channels to create increased broadband network capacity. Our channel aggregation algorithms include the ability to aggregate hard to utilize, non-contiguous narrowband channels and are a hallmark feature of a FullMAX broadband system.



The critical software algorithms powering our end-to-end FullMAX wireless SDR platform and related Fog-computing architecture have been developed by and are owned by Ondas Networks. FullMAX is an intelligent networking system which integrates core network management systems with edge computing resources including computing hardware and MC-IoT software applications. In the MC-IoT Fog enabled by FullMAX, base stations are enabled with a highly configurable Quality of Service algorithms which coordinate the data traffic within the Fog for both the edge radio and the resident MC-IoT applications. The intelligent base stations control and manage all network resources including our edge remotes; dynamically allocating bandwidth, prioritizing data packets and managing edge applications. The intelligent software-managed base stations determine whether to process data at the edge, distribute data traffic across the Fog to other edge remote radios or to transport information to the corporate Cloud. Our Edge remotes have embedded compute capability and are able to host MC-IoT applications including those from third party vendors via virtualized software systems managed in docker / container architectures and can also manage data from intelligent equipment or sensor networks that interface with the edge remotes in the field. Our software-managed edge remotes offer security via authentication, multi-layer encryption and virtual software firewalls which are requirements for mission-critical data networks.



We are dedicated to promoting standards-based wireless connectivity solutions for our customers. Our FullMAX platform is compliant with the mission critical wireless Industrial Internet IEEE 802.16s. The specifications in the IEEE 802.16s standard are primarily based on our FullMAX technology, and many of our customers and industrial partners actively supported our technology during the IEEE standards-making process. In January 2020, a new working group was launched by the IEEE to establish IEEE 802.16t, a further evolution of this wireless standard. The IEEE 802.16t working group includes industry-leading trade organizations such as the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”), MxV Rail (“MxV Rail”), the Utilities Technology Council (UTC) and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), as well as representation from world-leading transportation and oil and gas companies. We expect our technology to remain a prominent feature of this evolving standard.

Ondas Autonomous Systems



We provide our customers with turnkey data and information solutions designed to meet their unique requirements in the field. We do this via our internally developed Optimus System™, a highly automated commercial drone platform which provides customers with the ability to continuously digitize, analyze, and monitor their assets and field operations in real-time or near real-time.



The Optimus System™ has been designed from the ground up as an end-to-end product capable of continuous unattended operations in the real world. The Optimus System™ consists of (i) Optimus™, a highly automated, AI-powered drone with advanced imaging payloads (ii) the AirbaseTM, a ruggedized weatherproof base station for housing, data processing, and cloud transfer, and (iii) InsightfulTM, a secure web portal and API which enables remote interaction with the system, data, and resulting analytics anywhere in the world. These major subsystems are connected via a host of supporting technologies. Using advanced robotic techniques, the AirbaseTM has functionality that enables the automated swapping of batteries and payloads. Automated battery swapping allows for 24/7 operation of Optimus™ as the Optimus drone can immediately be redeployed after returning to the dock for a battery swap. Similarly, the ability to autonomously swap sensors and advanced payloads without human intervention allows for the Optimus System™ to provide multiple applications and use cases from a single location.



When deployed in smart city applications, the Optimus System™ is designed to operate as a network of smart drones linked to an urban control center and will function as a municipal infrastructure providing a variety of automated data solutions. The primary function of the deployed Urban Drone Infrastructure is to shorten response times of security and rescue forces to emergency situations, supporting law enforcement and homeland security activities, and streamlining diverse services provided by the municipality for the public’s benefit. The Company is also examining drone parcel delivery and other smart city applications to be provided by the infrastructure.



In these deployments, customers establish permanent infrastructure which rely on fleets of automated drones that do not require on the ground human intervention to operate. The drones are able to operate as a task force that can simultaneously collect and provide critical information for a variety of customer requirements. The Airobotics drone infrastructure is specifically designed for urban environments and strategic facilities that require immediate security, monitoring and emergency response. Each system within the infrastructure framework includes a smart Airbase enabling automated battery changes enabling 24/7 operations, along with the automated loading and installation of sensors appropriate for each specified mission. Each system covers a perimeter up to 80 square kilometers surrounding an Airbase. Drone flights can be tasked to carry specific sensors, enabling every drone in the system to execute diverse tasks. The drones can be activated for complex longer-term operations. Flights are overseen by remote operators in a command-and-control center.



In certain geographic markets we will partner with a distributor to support the marketing and provision of aerial data services provided by an Optimus System™. These distributors typically have unique local knowledge and can more cost effectively target customers for Urban Drone Infrastructure deployment. In some instances, we will form joint ventures with distributors to provide aerial data services to government and enterprise customers. These joint ventures typically include agreements to purchase Optimus Systems™ and are arranged so that Ondas Autonomous Systems and our partner can share in the revenue and profitability in the provision of aerial data services.



The Raider™ is a counter-drone system, which was designed and developed by Iron Drone, that we are marketing to government and enterprise customers who can utilize the system for security and the protection of critical infrastructure, assets and people from the threat of hostile drones. A typical Raider™ deployment location would include sensitive locations such as borders, stadiums or schools, or near critical assets such as power plants and military bases, and for high profile locations such as amusement parks or where public events are held.



The Raider™ is designed to detect, track and intercept unauthorized, or hostile unmanned aircraft and is most often sold with three small UAVs that are housed in a docking station. The Raider UAV has live video capability and a payload containing a net that can be deployed to intercept a hostile drone. Upon detection of an unauthorized drone, one or more Raider™ UAVs can be autonomously deployed at high speeds to track the unauthorized aircraft. If the unauthorized aircraft is deemed hostile, the Raider™ UAV can deploy the netting to physically intercept the aircraft. A parachute integrated with the netting allows the intercepted drone to safely fall to the ground for collection by our customer.

The Market for Our Products and Services



We have targeted the North American freight rail operators for the initial adoption of our FullMAX platform. These rail operators currently operate legacy communications systems utilizing serial-based narrowband wireless technologies for voice and data communications. These legacy wireless networks have limited data capacity and are unable to support the adoption of new, intelligent train control and management systems. In addition to data capacity challenges, rail operators need to reliably cover the vast and often remotely located rail track and related infrastructure which extends nationwide. The rail operators require a next-generation, robust broadband system with significantly increased data throughput capacity and flexibility to adopt new applications. We believe a transition to integrated Fog-computing wireless communications systems will enable the rail operators to drive more intelligence to the edge of their operating environments enabling real time automation and better operator control of many critical operating systems related to train control, crossing safety, train and track integrity and drone operations. This upgrade cycle is being driven by a recent key event which occurred in August 2020 in which the Class 1 rail systems in the U.S. were awarded new nationwide “greenfield” wideband radio spectrum by the Federal Communications Committee (“FCC”). As part of the award, the rail operators are required by 2025, to vacate a series of legacy narrowband channels. The completion of this multiyear negotiation between the FCC and other licensed users is projected to generate a major network upgrade cycle for the rail industry which will support enhanced safety and improved efficiency and profitability of train operations.



The North American Rail Network is vast in scale, consisting of 140,000 miles of track, 25,000 locomotives, and 1.6 million railcars. Within this large footprint, we believe there are 200,000 highway crossings, with at least 65,000 of the crossings equipped with electronic systems today, a number which is expected to increase in the coming years. The Class I railroads currently operate four separate private wireless networks in support of train operations. Those networks are deployed using spectrum in the 160 MHz, 220 MHz, 450 MHz and 900 MHz bands. We believe a significant portion of the communications infrastructure has been in operation for more than 20 years and now requires a technological upgrade to support new applications and increased capacity requirements. Our FullMAX MC-IoT platform offers an excellent migration path for these applications. The Class I Railroads value the ability of our frequency agnostic SDR architecture to enable a substantial data capacity increase utilizing the railroad’s existing wireless infrastructure and dedicated FCC licensed radio frequencies, as well as the flexibility to adapt to and take advantage of future changes in spectrum availability, as well as future business and operational requirements. Based upon management estimates, we believe the addressable market for the four private North American Railroad networks is approximately $1.3 billion. We believe the 900 MHz network will be the first network upgrade to adopt our FullMAX technology and we estimate that the market size for the 900 MHz network is approximately $450 million.



Additional Critical Markets 



We have launched additional initiatives to take our MC-IoT connectivity and ecosystem partnering strategy into other critical infrastructure markets. In June 2022, we announced the first successful installation of our technology into an Integrated Coastal Surveillance System (ICSS) in the Caribbean with a global defense contractor. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we received and delivered on a new ICSS order for the defense contractor to be deployed in India. We expect additional orders from this defense vendor for the ICSS application in 2023. We believe our FullMAX technology’s licensed frequency flexibility, reliability, and long communications range over ocean surfaces, is broadening the scale of our technology in this emerging market for homeland security.

The total addressable market (“TAM”) for commercial drone applications is also large – measuring over $100 billion in size, according to management estimates and independent third-party research. For the vast majority of commercial drone applications, full automation is required to make economic sense. The time and cost requirements of human pilots are too high for the demanding and monotonous routines that must be performed to extract value. Ondas Autonomous Systems’ drone platforms target the majority of “drone-in-a-box”-applicable commercial, public safety and defense markets.



Based upon management estimates, we believe the market size for the Smart City applications for the Optimus System™ to be over $15 billion.




● | Smart City Market ($15.1 billion TAM): the Smart City market consists of a range of sub-markets, including police, fire, medical, logistics, construction, utilities, infrastructure, ports, airports, and environmental surveys. For these markets, the Optimus System™ is used for routine, high-resolution automated emergency response, mapping, surveying, and inspection. These automated operations reduce the response time to emergency situations, increase safety and security, and reduce the cost of city services.

Customer Activity



Ondas Networks



The majority of Ondas Networks customer activity has been with the Class 1 freight railroad operators and Siemens in North America. There are seven Class I railroads in North America, all of which run multiple, frequency-specific networks for different applications. Our FullMAX platform has the flexibility to operate in all these frequency bands and will allow these customers the opportunity to better utilize their radio spectrum and add more high-value, data-intensive applications to their operations. Ondas Networks has completed multiple, ongoing testing and pilot programs with BNSF Railway and CSX Corporation, two North American Class I freight railroad operators in connection with the system validation performed on behalf of the Association of American Railroads’ (AAR) Wireless Communications Committee (WCC). Our initial focus with these rail customers has been for train control applications and related safety systems in the 900 MHz frequency band where the FCC has recently awarded our railroad customers new radio spectrum.



In August 2022, we received our first commercial volume order for the 900 MHz network from Siemens. We also delivered a Rail Lab (the “dot16 Rail Lab”) to MxV Rail, a subsidiary of the AAR, in September 2022. The dot16 Rail Lab is hosting multiple Class 1 freight rail operators where they will perform on going network design and configuration related to optimizing the performance of our IEEE 802.16 complaint systems in connection with wide-scale field deployment. We expect the commercial rollout of the 900 MHz to accelerate with the Class 1 freight rail operators throughout 2023 with multiple rail customers providing purchase orders and deploying our software-defined network. We expect a 900 MHz network upgrade cycle across all Class I railroad systems over the next few years in order to comply with FCC license requirements and meet business needs related to safety and profitability.

As of December 31, 2022, Ondas Networks was active with six of the Class 1 Rails in North America and with one of the largest railroads in the world, Indian Railways, for a multi-year delivery program of locomotive radios for on-board telemetry applications. Also in 2022, we received our first order for 160 MHz radios, a bridge to the next major rail network in North America, which we believe will be upgraded to our FullMAX™ platform.



Ondas Autonomous Systems



Our Optimus System™ addresses a wide number of applications and use cases across enterprise, industrial, and government end markets. The platform has been extensively tested both internally and externally with customers for reliability, safety, and performance. We received purchase orders from two customers in the UAE in December 2022, which represented our initial orders for commercial deployment as Urban Drone Infrastructure fleets. The initial purchase order was received for a UAE government entity with plans to primarily use the system for public safety and homeland security applications. We also announced a purchase order from Abu Dhabi-based SkyGo Transport of Goods L.L.C. (“SkyGo”). Airobotics and SkyGo have also signed a Term Sheet agreeing to enter into a joint venture (the “SkyGo JV”) to provide aerial drone services to municipal and government customers focused on Smart City use cases.



Customer interest in our aerial data services has grown significantly since receiving these initial fleet orders and that is reflected in a growing customer pipeline. The initial two customers have indicated plans to deploy approximately 50 systems in the UAE by 2025 and we believe demand could grow further. In addition, moving customers from proof-of-concept deployments to Urban Drone Infrastructure fleet deployments has validated the performance and value of our Optimus System™, which has helped both accelerate our marketing activity with existing customers and generated new customer interest to help expand the pipeline. We expect interest in our Optimus System ™ to grow significantly as awareness builds which will expand our customer pipeline.



We expect to expand customer activity in the United States as American Robotics introduces Optimus to its existing customers and expands marketing to new customers. In the United States, we are qualifying our oil and gas customers for marketing programs, and we plan to expand marketing to other industrial and government markets. 



We launched our Raider™ counter-drone system in March 2023 and began seeking customer orders at the same time. We have seen significant interest in the Raider™ For potential customers and partners and on March 10, 2023 we announced that the Dubai Police has signed an MOU which expressed their intent to purchase a certain number of units of the Raider™. We expect to receive additional orders as we expand marketing channels in 2023.



Manufacturing, Availability and Dependence upon Suppliers 



Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems utilize outsourced manufacturing partners in the building of product to fulfill customer orders. Utilizing contract manufacturers allows us to focus on designing, developing and selling our products. Furthermore, outsourced manufacturing allows us to leverage the economies of scale and expertise of specialized outsourced manufacturers, reduce manufacturing and supply chain risk and distribution costs.



Ondas Networks designs the printed circuit boards and enclosures for our radios and maintains the bill of materials for all of the products we manufacturer. A Bill of Materials (“BOM”) is a list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts and the quantities of each needed to manufacture the end product. The physical manufacturing of FullMAX circuit boards is outsourced to best-in-class industrial contract manufacturers. The contract manufacturer is responsible for sourcing the majority of components in the BOM, assembling the components onto the printed circuit boards and then delivering the final boards to us. Once at our facility, the boards are tested, then placed into enclosures and programmed with the appropriate software. The radios are then configured according to the requirement of the network and run through system level tests before being packaged and shipped to the customer. Ondas Networks maintains multiple contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to ensure competitive pricing and to reduce the risk from a single manufacturer.

Seasonality



We do not believe that the industry in which Ondas Networks and Ondas Autonomous Systems competes is subject to seasonal sales fluctuation.



Dependence on a Single Customer



Because we have only recently invested in our customer service and support organization, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial amount of our revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2022, one customer accounted for approximately $1,893,000 of our revenue, or approximately 89%. During the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for approximately $1,204,000 and $1,599,000 of our revenue, or approximately 41% and 55%, respectively.
Competition



Ondas Networks



We compete with alternatives to wireless technology, public cellular data networks and private wireless networking products from other manufactures. We believe that each of these competing solutions has core weaknesses when compared to FullMAX, as described below.



Public cellular data networks:




● | Public networks are more vulnerable to cyber security attacks from anywhere in the world including denial of service attacks; private networks can operate independent of the public internet. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Public networks are more susceptible to prolonged outages during man-made and natural disasters (e.g. 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, etc.), exactly when utilities and mission critical entities require the greatest reliability. 
● | Public networks are typically designed for population coverage rather than the geographic areas required by critical infrastructure providers, which often include remote locations. 
● | Public networks are by definition oversubscribed, shared networks without the necessary prioritization service to support mission critical applications. 
● | Public networks typically use shared infrastructure including tower sites and long-haul fiber connections resulting in vulnerabilities at many points. 
● | Public networks are designed to support high capacity downloading and streaming applications with limited upload bandwidth available. Industrial networks typically require the reverse traffic flow, often uploading data from a large number of remote locations. 






13







Other private wireless products:




● | Unlicensed Point to Multipoint Wireless (e.g., Wi-Fi) — This equipment is very inexpensive to purchase but is subject to interference, has many security vulnerabilities, uses a contention-based protocol and transmits only over short range. Deploying Wi-Fi over wide areas is cost prohibitive. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Private Licensed Narrowband Wireless Radios — These networks can provide good coverage and range but are typically too slow and lack sufficient bandwidth to support new applications and the increased number of data connections required. 




Alternate technologies:




● | Satellite Technologies — These technologies provide good coverage, but throughput is limited, and latency is too high to support mission-critical applications for our customers. These technologies can be very costly as compared to our products and systems. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) — LP-WAN solutions such as LoRa and NB-IoT are architected with lower power, the purpose of which is to make these typically sensor-based networks lower-cost solutions. The low powered equipment means these systems have lower throughput and higher latency and are not reliable for mission-critical applications that require both monitoring and control functions. 

Ondas Autonomous Systems



We compete with other drone OEMs providing a variety of solutions for inspection, security, asset tracking and other applications. We compete on many dimensions with system performance being differentiated by the level of autonomous operation, ease of use, reliability, safety, and government regulations. Further, leading automated data solution providers must provide diverse payload capabilities for data collection, along with robust, advanced analytics programs that are specific for each industry served.
Governmental Regulations 



Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations including: (i) authorization from the FCC for operation in various licensed frequency bands; (ii) FAA regulations and approvals unique to the operation of commercial or industrial drones; (iii) customers’ licenses from the FCC; (iv) licensing, permitting and inspection requirements applicable to contractors, electricians and engineers; (v) regulations relating to worker safety and environmental protection; (vi) permitting and inspection requirements applicable to construction projects; (vii) wage and hour regulations; (viii) regulations relating to transportation of equipment and materials, including licensing and permitting requirements; (ix) building and electrical codes; and (x) special bidding, procurement and other requirements on government projects.

The operation of our manufactured products by our customers (network providers and service providers) in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in a manner not in compliance with local law could result in fines, business disruption, or harm to our reputation. The changes to regulatory and technological requirements may also alter our product offerings, impacting our market share and business.  Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating licenses or could give rise to termination or cancellation rights under our contracts or disqualify us from future bidding opportunities.



Environmental Regulation



Our operations are subject to extensive, and frequently changing, federal, state and local environmental laws and substantial related regulation by government agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency. Among other matters, these regulatory authorities impose requirements that regulate the operation, handling, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials; protect the health and safety of workers; and require us to obtain and maintain licenses and permits in connection with our operations. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. Notwithstanding these burdens, we believe that we are in material compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing our operations.



There has been no material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements nor competitive positions as a result of these environmental regulations.



Employees 



As of March 10, 2023, we have 116 full-time employees, including 40 in the Ondas Networks segment and 76 in the Ondas Autonomous Systems segment. In addition, we have consulting agreements with 17 consultants for manufacturing, supply chain, documentation, engineering, regulatory, IT, and business development support.
