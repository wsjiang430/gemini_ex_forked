ITEM 1. BUSINESS
PURPOSE & STRATEGY
Signet Jewelers Limited’s (“Signet”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) purpose is “Inspiring Love” and its mission is to enable all people to “Celebrate Life and Express Love.” The Company’s vision is to be the world’s premier jeweler by engaging customers with superior shopping and ownership experiences, connecting with them seamlessly across channels, earning their trust, and providing superior expertise, value, products, and services to meet their lifetime jewelry needs and desires. Signet aims to be the innovation and market share leader of the jewelry category with opportunity for additional market share expansion and profitable growth as the Company leverages its flexible operating model and core strengths while investing to widen its competitive advantages.
In Fiscal 2021, Signet successfully completed a three-year transformation plan called Path to Brilliance, which was designed to position the Company for reliable, sustainable long-term growth. Having exceeded its overall Path to Brilliance goals, the Company launched its next phase of growth - Inspiring Brilliance - in Fiscal 2022 and continued in Fiscal 2023, focused on four “Where-to-Play” strategies: Win in Big Businesses; Expand Accessible Luxury and Value; Accelerate Services; and Lead Digital Commerce. The Company's priorities are to grow market share, deliver an annual double-digit non-GAAP operating margin, and allocate capital with a disciplined, strategic approach that invests in the business while also returning cash to shareholders and driving annual revenues toward a longer-term goal of $9 billion.
Inspiring Brilliance
As described above, the foundations of Inspiring Brilliance are focused on four “Where-to-Play” strategies: Win in Big Businesses; Expand Accessible Luxury and Value; Accelerate Services; and Lead Digital Commerce. Below is the summary of the goals within these strategies, as well as progress and accomplishments toward those goals during Fiscal 2023.
•Win in Big Businesses: Signet is investing in and keeping its largest businesses healthy and growing by differentiating and positioning Signet banners with the customers they serve best and by leading innovation that will help ensure they win. Leveraging disciplined market segmentation - by demographics, by psychographics, by customer journey (e.g., bridal), and by price tiers - Signet is leveraging its banner portfolio to expand the available market in which it competes and attract new and loyal customers across the portfolio. This progress helped drive an estimated 40 basis point gain to Signet’s US market share to 9.7% in Fiscal 2023 and up from 6.5% since Fiscal 2020. Given the highly fragmented jewelry market landscape, we believe Signet has significant potential to further expand market share.
•Expand Accessible Luxury and Value: The Company is expanding the mid-market segment of the jewelry category by stretching the top of the mid-tier with greater focus on tiering up into accessible luxury and the lower mid-tier with value offerings. In addition, the Company acquired Diamonds Direct, an accessible luxury banner with a highly productive operating model in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022. The Company also acquired Blue Nile, the leading accessible luxury online retailer of engagement rings and fine jewelry, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2023 with a more affluent, diverse, and differentiated customer base. Signet continues to drive penetration in accessible luxury and move customers up the value chain across its banners by tiering up its assortment and leading category product and services innovation while also continuing to innovate for value-conscious customers by value-engineering new products in its assortment, leveraging scaled vertical integration in the supply chain, and by continuing to cut costs that customers don't see or care about.
•Accelerate Services: Signet is positioned to create a $1 billion revenue stream through services - up $600 million from Fiscal 2020 - as well as expand its known customer base and first party data with the “Vault Rewards” loyalty program. Services carry higher margin profiles, and Signet is focused on introducing consumer-driven services including personalization as well as expanding existing services such as Extended Service Plans and repair services to enhance the jewelry ownership experience. The Company continues to strengthen its reputation as a preferred supplier of jewelry repair services with increased repair customer satisfaction ratings Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) up 18 points since Fiscal 2020, decreased repair turnaround times, and innovative offerings such as digital repair tracking. The Company launched its “Vault Rewards” loyalty program this past year across Jared, Kay and Zales which now has approximately 1.5 million members and is showing strong month-to-month growth. Of note, loyalty members are already showing higher purchase frequency and average transaction values (“ATV”) than non-loyalty customers offering meaningful growth potential.
•Lead Digital Commerce: Digital innovation and capabilities are integral to the future of jewelry retail and is a cornerstone of Signet’s growth strategy. Signet now believes it has become the digital innovation leader in specialty retail jewelry through focused investment and agile implementation. The Company's four-plus years of digital investments have yielded a NPS of 74 in Fiscal 2023, a 5 point improvement from the prior year and up 10 points versus Fiscal 2020. In Fiscal 2023, the Company implemented customer-facing digital capabilities as well as operational technologies to strengthen its competitive 
advantages. Innovations included enhancement to Virtual Try-On, Virtual Appointments, Chat and Digital Store fronts enabling a more seamless shopping experience for our customers. Signet continues to make progress with this critical capability through both customer-facing enhancements and the use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning in many operational parts of its business such as inventory distribution and flexible fulfillment capabilities, all intended to modernize the connected commerce experience for our customers.
How to Win: The Company is executing these growth strategies with three “How to Win” priorities: a Consumer-Inspired mindset, Connected Commerce presence, and a Culture of Innovation and Agility.
•Consumer Inspired: The Company is growing its customer base by drawing inspiration from inside and outside the jewelry category to drive innovation. Signet’s ability to develop unique customer insights with highly precise data analytics is emerging as a clear and sustainable competitive advantage. An example is Signet's understanding of customer desire for personalized products. Jewelry customers have a broad mindset when they think about product customization. For some, it means engraving - adding symbols or a personal message - along with precise and tailored sizing. For others, it’s configuring a piece from a set of options, with a jewelry consultant or virtually. A fast-growing segment of customers want to combine and modify pieces or design a custom piece entirely from scratch - even from a hand-drawn sketch that we transform into a beautiful bespoke piece of jewelry. The Company sees this personalization trend as a $700 million growth opportunity across Signet. It is an investment priority this year and beyond.
•Connected Commerce: As part of its Path to Brilliance transformation, Signet moved from a brick-and-mortar-centric business model to an OmniChannel strategy. Now, through Inspiring Brilliance, the Company is positioning itself to win with connected commerce capabilities that enable Signet banners to engage with customers whenever, wherever and however they want to shop. No other jewelry retailer offers a comparable mix of stores and digital platforms to serve customers. In Fiscal 2023, approximately 20% of sales were completed online and 75% of customers reported that they used a banner website prior to completing their purchase, which indicates that Signet customers now use both online and in-store experiences as part of their shopping journey. These seamless, friction-free experiences lead to higher ATV and stronger conversion rates than a traditional OmniChannel strategy.
In addition, the Company is leveraging AI, machine learning and data-driven insights in many operational parts of its business such as inventory distribution, labor planning and real estate fleet optimization. For example, coupling new digital capabilities together with a 21% reduction in store fleet (net of openings and acquisitions) resulted in an increase in sales per square foot on an annual basis of nearly 50%, and drove approximately 500 basis points of efficiency in store occupancy costs since the beginning of our transformation. Similarly, sales per labor hour in core banners increased approximately 47% and inventory turnover improved nearly 40% since Fiscal 2020.
•Culture of Innovation and Agility: Signet has transformed its culture – achieving three consecutive years of being named a Great Place to Work-Certified™ Company and improved scores in its Voice of the Employer survey, including how team members feel their work contributes to Signet’s purpose (up 28 points) and that they believe in our strategy (up 15 points). With the strength of its organization, Signet is committed to be the innovation leader of every business in which it competes and to operate with the agility required to learn, grow and lead. To enable this level of performance, the Company provides industry-leading training and development through what it calls "Brilliant University." This growth-focused training improves customer experiences, drives execution and agility, and enables performance and career growth possibilities for every team member who participates in the program. The strength of Signet’s culture has become a competitive advantage as it attracts top talent, enables high retention and lower attrition rates, and inspires peak performance at every level of the organization, all of which are reflected in the Company’s strong business performance. For example, Signet’s full-time team member retention increased 4 points in Fiscal 2023, at a time when the retail industry overall saw significant attrition. This matters because a Jewelry Consultant with 2+ years’ experience sells more than twice as much as a new Jewelry Consultant with tenure of 6 months or less. Further, aggregated cost reductions and process improvements of approximately $500 million have fueled investments and expanded Signet’s annual non-GAAP operating margin to 10.8% in Fiscal 2023, up over 600 basis points since Fiscal 2019.
Signet is demonstrating that it has the strategies, competitive advantages, and talent to consistently outpace the market and deliver reliable, long-term sustainable growth.
2030 Corporate Sustainability Goals 
As a company with a Board level Corporate Citizenship & Sustainability Committee focused on its corporate sustainability strategy, Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) data disclosures, and a Purpose-inspired business strategy as described in the above Inspiring Brilliance section, Signet is committed to ongoing leadership in sustainability and ESG initiatives as an important growth driver that is critical to the health of our business. To that end, the Company has integrated its 2030 Corporate Sustainability Goals into its business strategy, further strengthening Signet’s Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability leadership in the industry. Having already established its open-sourced Signet Responsible Sourcing Protocol which has become the industry standard for ethical and responsible sourcing, the Company now is committed to be the jewelry category leader in supply chain due diligence and reporting.
The Company’s Corporate Sustainability Goals are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals in areas where Signet can have the most impact. Signet is a member of the UN Global Compact and adheres to its principles-based approach to responsible business. The Company has named a Chief ESG Officer, and under the leadership of the Chief Executive Officer, the entire Signet Leadership Team is engaged to provide governance and accountability on the Company’s goals. Leaders throughout the Company are engaged in the Company’s Sustainability efforts. Banner leaders as well as functional leaders in Corporate Communications & Sustainability, Finance, Human Resources, Supply Chain, IT and Merchandising are responsible for achieving short-term and long-term goals. Signet released its first annual update on its goals it its Fiscal 2022 Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability report published in June 2022. The Company has already achieved three of its forty-four Corporate Sustainability Goals while continuing to make steady progress towards its remaining goals.

OVERVIEW
Signet is the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry. Signet is incorporated in Bermuda and its address and telephone number are shown on the cover of this document. The Company operated 2,808 stores and kiosks as of January 28, 2023, which when combined with the Company’s digital capabilities under its Connected Commerce strategy, provides customers the opportunity to use both online and in-store experiences as part of their shopping journey. Signet manages its business by geography, a description of which follows:
•The North America reportable segment operates nine banners, with the majority operating through both online and brick and mortar retail operations. The segment had 2,382 locations in the US and 93 locations in Canada as of January 28, 2023. 
◦In the US, the segment operates under the following banners: Kay (Kay Jewelers and Kay Outlet); Zales (Zales Jewelers and Zales Outlet); Jared (Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry and Jared Vault); Banter by Piercing Pagoda; Diamonds Direct; Rocksbox; and digital banners, James Allen and Blue Nile.
◦In Canada, the segment primarily operates under the Peoples banner (Peoples Jewellers).
•The International reportable segment had 333 locations in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Channel Islands as of January 28, 2023, as well as maintains an online retail presence for its principal banners, H. Samuel and Ernest Jones.
Certain Company activities are managed in the “Other” segment for financial reporting purposes, including the Company’s diamond sourcing function and its diamond polishing factory in Botswana. See Note 5 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the Company’s reportable segments.
Competition and Signet Competitive Strengths
Jewelry retailing is highly fragmented and competitive. Signet competes against other specialty jewelers, as well as other retailers that sell jewelry, including department stores, mass merchandisers, discount stores, apparel and accessory fashion stores, brand retailers, online retail and auction sites, shopping clubs, home shopping television channels and direct home sellers. The jewelry category competes for customers’ share-of-wallet with other consumer sectors such as electronics, clothing and furniture, as well as experience-oriented categories such as travel and restaurants. This competition for consumers’ discretionary spending is particularly relevant to gift giving.
In addition to the core strengths noted above, Signet believes its competitive advantages include strong awareness for each banner, superior customer experience, branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise, data-driven marketing and advertising, a diversified real estate portfolio, an efficient and flexible supply chain, and services including financing and lease purchase options, extended service plans, repair and custom design, and piercing, among others.
Connected commerce
As a specialty jeweler, Signet’s business differs from many other retailers such that a purchase of merchandise from any of Signet’s stores is not only viewed as an important experience but is also personal and intimate. Due to this dynamic experience, customers often invest time on Signet websites, through conversational commerce and on social media to experience the merchandise assortments prior to visiting brick-and-mortar stores to execute a purchase transaction. Approximately 75% of our in-store purchasers use digital channels to assist in their purchase journey. This is particularly true related to high value retail transactions, as customers will often supplement their online experience with an in-store visit prior to making a large purchase.
Through Signet’s banner websites, the Company educates customers about the jewelry category and provides them with a source of information on products, brands, and available merchandise, as well as the ability to buy online. To effectively service the ever-evolving needs of its digitally connected customers, Signet’s websites are integrated with a customer’s local store, so that merchandise ordered online may be delivered to their store or their home. Customers can easily filter product assortments by the delivery method of choice including but not limited to quick ship, buy-online-pickup-in-store (“BOPIS”), and same day delivery. Customers can also see if the product is available at their local store on the product description page. Banner websites continue to make an important and 
growing contribution to the customer experience, as well as to each banner’s marketing programs. Signet’s Connected Commerce strategy will continue to focus on:
•Investments in technologies and digital capabilities to enhance the customer journey. These include developing AI driven conversational commerce, the ability to virtually try on products, visual search tools, configuration capability, alternative and flexible payment options, jewelry related services, enhanced personalization/behavioral targeting, creative execution and brand differentiation. In addition, Signet will continue to focus on customer-first delivery options (such as BOPIS, same day delivery, curbside pickup, quick ship and ship from store), creating a seamless customer experience between the websites and the customer. Investments in virtual and in-store selling make it easier and more enjoyable for customers to shop whenever and however they choose.
•The expansion of asynchronous messaging with intent recognition and the ability to route to the appropriate expert based on that intent recognition whether that be a sales expert for engagement rings, watches or other gifts, or service to an existing order or purchase. At the end of 2021, the Company introduced 2-way SMS as a new channel to speak with Virtual Jewelry Experts. The channel has been growing every quarter since inception as customer preferences shift. We know approximately 40% of customers who talk with Virtual Jewelry Experts via SMS purchase in stores after their conversation, further solidifying our investment in Connected Commerce strategies.
•In Fiscal 2022, Signet introduced its Vault Rewards loyalty program across the North America banners to offer benefits for customer engagement and increased purchases through the earning of “gems” and other member benefits. The goal of the program is to grow our loyal customer base, driving repeat purchases over time and rewarding our most loyal customers. 
•Introduction of a robust Customer Data Platform and Journey Analytics and Orchestration program to achieve a more comprehensive and personalized view of the customer, and facilitate cookie-less data activation which is expected to allow the Company to follow up on previous purchases as well as anticipate customer needs.
•Adding new capabilities to Signet’s digital customer clientele program, which enables the Company’s jewelry consultants to build a direct relationship with their customers to create a more personalized customer experience. In Fiscal 2022, this program was further enhanced with a newly created Digital In-Store Integration practice established to lead the integration of digital into brick and mortar stores across Signet banners. This team partners closely with the information technology (“IT”) and operations teams to harmonize and enhance existing applications and systems and use next generation training techniques to provide the right level of training and support to the field team. 
Signet’s supplier relationships allow the Company to display suppliers’ inventories on the banner websites for sale to customers without holding the items in its inventory until the products are ordered by customers, which are referred to as “virtual inventory.” Virtual inventory expands the choice of merchandise available to customers both online and in-store. In the North America reportable segment, sales of virtual inventory accounted for approximately 53% of online sales and 11% of total sales in Fiscal 2023 (see further in the Products and merchandising section below).
Customer experience
Signet is committed to delivering an inspiring, innovative, full service, seamlessly connected customer experience for our clients regardless of their channel of choice. The Company considers this an essential element and competitive advantage in the success of its business. The ability to recruit, develop and retain qualified jewelry consultants is an important capability to deliver customer satisfaction. Signet has comprehensive recruitment, training and incentive programs in place, including annual training conferences in the spring and fall.
Signet continues to invest in capabilities to enhance the customer experience to make it more personalized and journey focused. In Fiscal 2019, Signet implemented a multi-phase Voice of the Customer program utilizing the Net Promoter System as a component of its Path to Brilliance transformation plan and customer first initiatives. The first phase focused on setting up the technology, establishing stable measurements throughout the shopping ecosystem for key customer journeys, and discovering how to effectively operationalize customer feedback. In Fiscal 2020, Signet expanded into phase two by providing all stores and digital properties localized access to Voice of the Customer data to manage the customer experience real-time as performance feedback is received. To further strengthen its engagement with customers, Signet also implemented a closed-loop program whereby field and customer care teams rapidly respond to customers directly about their feedback to ensure the Company is delivering the best possible experience. In Fiscal 2021, Signet continued to optimize the program through expanded measurements and listening posts, integrating Voice of the Customer with additional operational data sources to drive greater sophistication in its customer and employee experience management, and develop additional tools to infuse the stories its customers share into the culture and their daily activities. In Fiscal 
2023 and 2022 multiple survey programs were launched in additional channels such as BOPIS, delivery, and customer care to unlock key opportunities to drive customer centric strategies and improve experiences across Signet.
Banner operations
As noted above, the Company operates nine banners in North America and two banners in the UK, with the majority operating through both online and brick and mortar retail operations. Signet has specific operating and financial criteria that must be satisfied before investing in new stores or renewing leases on existing stores, including evaluation of the mall/trade area and market potential. The Company has reduced its store fleet by approximately 20% since beginning its transformation in Fiscal 2019, driving more than 400 basis points of gross margin leverage over that time. Substantially all the stores operated by Signet are leased. Signet continues to reposition its store portfolio in a manner that it believes will drive greater store productivity. These efforts include development and implementation of innovative store concepts to improve the in-store shopping experience, execution of opportunistic store relocations and store closures aimed at exiting under-performing stores, reducing the Company’s mall-based exposure and exiting regional brands.

North America Banners
The North America reportable segment operates jewelry stores in malls, mall-based kiosks and off-mall locations throughout the US and Canada and online under national banners including Kay, Zales, Jared, Peoples, Banter by Piercing Pagoda and Diamonds Direct. Additionally, the Company operates online through its digital banners, James Allen and Blue Nile, and through the jewelry subscription business Rocksbox, as well as each of the individual banner websites.
Kay Jewelers (“Kay”)
Kay is the largest specialty retail jewelry brand in the US based on sales. Kay operates in shopping malls, off-mall centers, outlet malls and online. Kay is positioned as the champion of modern love and gratitude, the #1 US jeweler for bridal and all occasion-based gifting offering a broad assortment of fine jewelry including bridal, diamond solitaire, fashion jewelry and watches.
Kay accounted for 36% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 38%). 
Zales Jewelers (“Zales”)
Zales is the third largest specialty retail jewelry brand in the US, based on sales. Zales operates primarily in shopping malls, outlet malls, neighborhood power centers and online. Zales “The Diamond Store” is positioned as the style and self-expression fine jewelry authority, an emphasis on fashion-oriented bridal, gifting and self-purchase consumers offering a broad range of bridal, diamond solitaire, fashion jewelry and watches.
Zales accounted for 18% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 22%).
Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry (“Jared”)
Jared, which offers the broadest selection of merchandise, is the fourth largest US specialty retail jewelry brand by sales and is a leading off-mall destination specialty retail jewelry store chain. Jared is positioned with an “accessible luxury” assortment and additional services to appeal to a higher income customer and deliver higher average price points than Kay and Zales. Every Jared store has an on-site Design & Service Center where most repairs are completed within the same day.
Jared locations are typically free-standing sites with high visibility and traffic flow, positioned close to major roads within shopping developments. Jared stores primarily operate in retail centers that contain strong retail co-tenants, including big box, destination stores and some smaller specialty units.
Jared accounted for 17% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 17%).
Diamonds Direct
On November 17, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Diamonds Direct USA Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Diamonds Direct”).
Diamonds Direct is an off-mall, destination jeweler in the US, with a highly productive, efficient operating model with demonstrated growth and profitability. Diamonds Direct’s strong value proposition, extensive bridal offering and customer-centric, high-touch shopping experience is destination for younger, luxury-oriented bridal shoppers. Diamonds Direct furthers Signet’s accessible luxury positioning with a distinct focus on bridal, appealing to a higher income customer and delivers higher average price points compared to other banners. Diamonds Direct’s stores are typically located in desirable off-mall sites proximate to high-end, destination centers alongside strong performing upscale retailers.
Diamonds Direct accounted for 6% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 2%).
Banter by Piercing Pagoda (“Banter”)
Banter, our curated jewelry and piercing services brand, empowers its customers to express themselves with affordably priced selections of basic and fashion gold, silver and diamond jewelry. The brand operates primarily online and through mall-based kiosks in high-traffic areas across the US that are easily accessible and visible in regional shopping malls. Banter opened 16 inline locations in Fiscal 2023 within shopping malls and outdoor lifestyle centers. The brand also offers virtual styling sessions, giving customers a new digital shopping experience. Banter has continued to expand its facial piercing offerings with the introduction of hollow needle piercing in select markets, seeing opportunity to leverage this growing trend.
Banter accounted for 5% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 7%).
Digital pure-play banners
On August 19, 2022, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Blue Nile, Inc. (“Blue Nile”). Blue Nile is a leading online retailer of engagement rings and fine jewelry. This acquisition brings together James Allen, the world’s premier online retailer of fine diamonds and bridal jewelry, and Blue Nile, as Signet’s digital “pure-play” banners, to maximize and achieve meaningful operating synergies that will increase value for both our consumers and shareholders. The addition of Blue Nile accelerates Signet’s efforts to grow its share in bridal and enhance its connected commerce capabilities and digital leadership across the jewelry category. Blue Nile brings a lower overall price mix than James Allen, but a higher engagement ring ticket, and complements James Allen with an older demographic focused on luxury purchases, all of which is immediately additive to the top of Signet’s customer funnel.
Digital pure-play banners accounted for 7% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 5%).
Peoples Jewellers (“Peoples”)
Peoples is Canada’s largest specialty jewelry retailer and is positioned as “Canada’s #1 Diamond Store” emphasizing its diamond business while also offering a wide selection of gold jewelry, gemstone jewelry and watches. Peoples operates primarily in shopping malls and online.
Peoples accounted for 3% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 3%).
Rocksbox
On March 29, 2021, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Rocksbox Inc. (“Rocksbox”), a jewelry rental subscription business that allows members to discover new looks, trends or add classic styles to their jewelry collection. Rocksbox is direct to customer, acquiring members primarily through digital advertising. For $21/month members receive three pieces of jewelry in a set mailed to their door. There is no limit to the number of sets that can be received every month and the $21 monthly membership fee can be applied as a credit towards the purchase of any piece from their set. Rocksbox accounted for less than 1% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.
International Banners
The International reportable segment operates primarily in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The International segment transacts mainly in British pounds, as sales and the majority of operating expenses are incurred in that currency.
H.Samuel
H.Samuel has 150 years of jewelry heritage, with a target customer focused on lower-price point fashion-trend oriented, everyday jewelry. H.Samuel continues to focus on larger store formats in regional shopping centers.
H.Samuel accounted for 3% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 3%).
Ernest Jones
Ernest Jones serves the upper middle market, with a target customer focused on high-quality, timeless jewelry.
Ernest Jones accounted for 3% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2023 (Fiscal 2022: 3%).
Products and merchandising 
Signet believes that a competitive strength is its industry-leading merchandising. Merchandise selection, innovation, availability and value are all critical success factors. The range of merchandise offered and the appropriate level of inventory availability are supported centrally by extensive and continuous research and testing. Signet’s jewelry merchant teams are constantly evaluating global design trends, innovating, and developing new jewelry collections, including through strategic partnerships, that resonate with customers.
Suppliers
In Fiscal 2023, the five largest suppliers collectively accounted for approximately 15.3% of total purchases, with the largest supplier comprising 3.8%. Signet transacts business with suppliers on a worldwide basis at various stages of the supply chain with third party diamond cutting and jewelry manufacturing being predominantly carried out in Asia.
Merchandise
Details of merchandise mix by major product category (excluding repairs, extended service plans, loose diamonds and other miscellaneous sales) are shown below:

 | North America | | International | | | Consolidated
Fiscal 2023 | | | | | | 
Bridal | 49 | % | | 46 | % | | 49 | %
Fashion | 45 | % | | 19 | % | | 44 | %
Watches | 4 | % | | 35 | % | | 5 | %
Other | 2 | % | | — | % | | 2 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | | 100 | %
Fiscal 2022 | | | | | | 
Bridal | 47 | % | | 47 | % | | 47 | %
Fashion | 48 | % | | 20 | % | | 46 | %
Watches | 4 | % | | 33 | % | | 6 | %
Other | 1 | % | | — | % | | 1 | %
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

The bridal category, which includes engagement, wedding and anniversary purchases, is predominantly diamond jewelry. All of our product categories are to an extent dependent on the economic environment as customers can trade up or down price points depending on their available budget. Bridal represented 49% of Signet’s total merchandise sales and the fashion category represents 44% of Signet’s total merchandise sales during Fiscal 2023.
Merchandise is categorized as non-branded, third party branded, and branded differentiated and exclusive. Non-branded merchandise includes items and styles such as bracelets, gold necklaces, solitaire diamond rings, and diamond stud earrings. Branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise are items that are branded and exclusive to Signet within its marketplaces, or that are not widely available from other jewelry retailers (e.g. Vera Wang Love®, Neil Lane®, Disney Enchanted®).
Signet believes that the development of branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise raises the profile of its banners, helps to drive sales and provides its well-trained jewelry consultants with a powerful selling proposition. Digital marketing and national television advertisements include elements that drive brand awareness and purchase intent. Signet’s scale and proven record of success in developing branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise attracts offers of such programs from jewelry manufacturers, designers and others ahead of competing retailers, and enables it to leverage its supply chain strengths.
Merchandise held on consignment is used to enhance product selection and test new designs. This minimizes exposure to changes in fashion trends and provides the flexibility for the Company to return non-performing merchandise to vendors. The bulk of Signet’s consignment inventory is held in the US.
Raw materials
The Company’s costs, as with the jewelry industry as a whole, are generally affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds, gold and, to a much lesser extent, other precious and semi-precious metals and stones. The cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry, with labor costs and assembly costs from third-party vendors also being significant factors.
Diamond sourcing
Signet procures its diamonds mostly as finished jewelry and, to a smaller extent, as loose polished diamonds and rough diamonds which are in turn polished, primarily in Signet’s Botswana factory.
Signet purchases finished product where management has identified compelling value based on product design, cost and availability, among other factors. Under certain types of arrangements, this method of purchasing also provides the Company with the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with suppliers, which reduces the risk of over- or under-purchasing. Signet’s scale, balance sheet and robust procurement systems enable it to purchase merchandise at advantageous prices and on favorable terms.
Signet purchases loose polished diamonds in global markets (e.g. India, Israel) from a variety of sources (e.g. polishers, traders). Signet mounts stones in settings purchased from manufacturers using third-parties and in-house resources. By using these approaches, the cost of merchandise is reduced, and the consistency of quality is maintained enabling Signet to provide better value to customers. Buying loose diamonds helps allow Signet’s buyers to gain a detailed understanding of the manufacturing cost structures and, in turn, leverage that knowledge to negotiating better prices for the supply of finished products.
Signet continues to take steps to advance its vertical integration, which includes rough diamond sourcing and processing. Signet’s objective with this initiative is to secure additional, reliable and consistent supplies of diamonds for customers worldwide while achieving further efficiencies in the supply chain. Signet owns a diamond polishing factory in Gaborone, Botswana. The Company is a DeBeers sightholder and receives contracted allocations of rough diamonds. Signet has also established a diamond liaison office in India and a diamond trading office in New York to further support its sourcing initiative.
Rough diamonds are purchased directly from the miners and then the stones are marked, cut and polished in Signet’s own polishing facility. Any stones deemed unsuitable for Signet’s needs are sold to third-parties on the open market.
Marketing and advertising
Marketing is one of Signet’s most critical investments. It generates customer awareness, drives purchase considerations, and over time strengthens consumer lifetime value and drives share growth. Effective and efficient marketing investment is a competitive advantage in the jewelry industry, which involves a discretionary purchase where most of the merchandise is not branded, and the purchase cycle can stretch to years.
Signet’s marketing investment is actively managed across multiple online and offline consumer touchpoints from online video to in-store product storytelling, and the spend distribution evolves over time to align to changes in consumer behavior and economic shifts.
As marketing activities are undertaken throughout the year, digital and data capabilities provide real-time insights into customer journeys, enabling personalized communications. Signet will continue to evolve its marketing model by re-balancing the timing and mix of its media investments, leveraging a more personalized journey-based approach, and modernizing its content and messaging in order to improve effectiveness and better align to shifts in consumer media consumption. Additionally, while the Company will 
maintain its strong presence during traditional time-based holidays (Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, and the Holiday Season), Signet will also expand capabilities to grow its share of personal gifting occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries and continue its emphasis in “always on” bridal messaging.
Signet will continue to optimize the effectiveness of its creative campaigns, building on banner differentiation strategies. The banners work with a portfolio of creative agencies and have built both internal and external data and media expertise.

Other sales and services
The Company offers repair services to its customers that include both merchandise repairs and custom design services. These services represent less than 5% of consolidated sales; however, represent an important opportunity to build customer loyalty. The custom design and repair business has its own field management and training structure and operates in Design & Service Centers located in Jared stores. These Design & Service Centers are staffed with skilled artisans who support the repair and custom business generated in the Kay, Zales and Jared banners. Signet’s custom jewelry sales use a proprietary computer selling system and in-store design capabilities.
The North America segment sells extended service plans covering lifetime repair service for jewelry and jewelry replacement plans in Banter. The Design & Service Centers also service the lifetime repair service plans for Kay, Zales and Jared, in addition to supporting the chargeable repairs and custom businesses. The lifetime repair service plans cover services such as ring sizing, refinishing and polishing, rhodium plating of white gold, earring repair, chain soldering and the resetting of diamonds and gemstones that arise due to the normal usage of the merchandise or a replacement option if the merchandise cannot be repaired. The extended service plans are a valuable part of the customer experience and product offerings. These plans provide the Company a higher rate of profitability than merchandise sales and are a significant component of Signet’s operating income. In Fiscal 2022, we introduced updated extended service agreements offering unique plans for both bridal and fashion merchandise, with additional benefits including engraving for bridal merchandise. Jewelry replacement plans require the issuance of new replacement merchandise if the original merchandise is determined to be defective or damaged within a defined period in accordance with the plan agreement. The North America segment also offers customers a two-year fine watch warranty. Other services managed through recent third party offerings include personal jewelry insurance and appraisals. Refer to Note 3 in Item 8 for further information on these plans.
In Fiscal 2023, we introduced our Vault Rewards loyalty program across Kay, Zales and Jared, which is a program that provides its members with benefits and offers once enrolled. As of the end of Fiscal 2023, the Company has over 1.5 million members enrolled in this program.
Customer finance
Several factors inherent in the US jewelry business support the circumstances through which Signet is positioned to generate profitable incremental business through its partner supported consumer payment programs. These factors include a high average transaction value and a significant population of customers seeking to finance merchandise, primarily in the bridal category. Signet’s financial service offerings are an integral part of its business and a major driver of customer retention. In North American markets, customers are offered revolving and promotional credit plans under Signet’s private label credit card programs, a lease purchase option provided by Progressive Lease, and installment loan and split-payment options provided by Affirm, allowing Signet to offer payment options that meet each customer’s individual needs. In addition, the Company has partnerships with third-party providers who directly extend financing to its customers, and who also manage and service the customers’ accounts. Refer to Note 13 of Item 8 for further information.
Below is a summary of the payment participation rate in North America which reflects activity for Signet’s outsourced credit program in North America, for Kay, Jared, Zales and Banter customers, as well as lease purchase customers:

(dollars in millions) | Fiscal 2023 | | Fiscal 2022
Total North America sales (1) | $ | 6,189.8 | | $ | 6,700.2
Credit, lease and Affirm purchase sales | $ | 2,734.2 | | $ | 2,739.9
Credit, lease and Affirm purchase sales as % of total eligible North America sales (1) | 44.2 | % | | 40.9 | % 

(1) Excludes Diamonds Direct, digital banners and Rocksbox, as these banners do not participate in the Company’s financing programs discussed above.
Through Signet’s partnerships, the Company is able to offer a range of financing, leasing, and payment opportunities across most of its banners. The Company continues to source and develop new options to meet its customer’s needs across the various merchandise price points. These offerings and partnerships allow the Company to focus on its core business of being the premier jewelry partner for its customers.
Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank (collectively “Comenity”) provide credit and services to the Kay, Jared, Zales and Banter banners. Genesis Financial Solutions (“Genesis”) provides a second look program for applicants declined by Comenity. During Fiscal 2022, the Comenity and Genesis program agreements were amended and restated to terminate in December 2025. Additionally, in Fiscal 2022 Signet entered into amended and restated purchase agreements with Carval, Castlelake, and Genesis (“Investors”) regarding the purchase of add-on receivables on such Investors’ existing accounts, as well as the purchase of the Signet-owned credit card receivables portfolio for accounts that had been originated through Fiscal 2021. Servicing of these non-prime add-on receivables, including operational interfaces and customer servicing, is provided by Genesis. As a result of the amended and restated agreements entered into with Comenity, Genesis, and the Investors during Fiscal 2022, Signet no longer retains any customer in-house finance receivables. In addition, on March 7, 2022, the Company entered into amended and restated receivable purchase agreements with CarVal and Castlelake regarding the purchase of add-on receivables on such Investors’ existing accounts. Under the amended and restated agreements, The Bank of Missouri will be the issuer for the add-on receivables on these existing accounts and CarVal and Castlelake will purchase the receivables from The Bank of Missouri. Refer to Note 13 of Item 8 for further information.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Signet’s People First approach
At Signet, our approach to human capital management starts with our core value of “People First” and aims at creating a truly inclusive, innovative, and collaborative company culture. As a retail company, sales and customer relationships are at the core of our business model. Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly engaged and motivated team members who are deeply connected to our Purpose of Inspiring Love. All team members are immersed in the Signet’s employee experience where team members are invited to be their best selves; introduced to new ideas that grow their passion, not just their jobs; and are inspired to inspire more love in the world.

We believe that thriving and engaged team members are integral to Signet’s success. Our emphasis on rewarding our retail team members with competitive wages and benefits provides a compelling package. We invested significantly in the wages and overall compensation of our existing team members in the fall of Fiscal 2022 by raising the minimum wage to $15/hour for our US operations, ahead of many retailers. For eligible jewelry consultants and sales associates in the US, our total average hourly wage with commissions and incentives is currently $21.93.
In Fiscal 2023, Signet was again named a Great Place to Work-Certified™ Company for the third consecutive year which reflects the pride, engagement, and enthusiasm of our team members throughout our organization. We are proud and honored by this recognition and we attribute this accolade to our focus on our Purpose, company culture, team member engagement and our overall human capital management strategy. In Fiscal 2023, Signet was named by Great Place to Work® and Fortune magazine as one of the 2022 Best Workplaces in Retail™ for the first time.

Training
We’re creating an inclusive and energizing environment where all team members can be empowered to learn, grow, and have meaningful careers. Advancement opportunities through internal leadership mentorship programs, training, internships, and a recruiting strategy to ensure we pursue top diverse talent. The Company has implemented development and sponsorship programs focused on increasing the diversity of our leadership at every level. In Fiscal 2023, Signet launched its Enterprise Mentoring Program to support personal and career growth. New cohorts are launched each quarter with a fresh cohort of mentoring pairs. More than 650 Signet team members participated in the program in Fiscal 2023.
In Fiscal 2023, Signet continued to invest in our learning platform, Brilliant University, to support team member training, leadership development and education. The platform gives team members access to training modules from their very first day of employment. Investments in our people, such as training, allows us to recruit exceptional candidates from other retailers and industries and efficiently provide them with new skills and experiences regarding Signet values, leadership traits and jewelry knowledge.
Brilliant University empowers team members to invest in learning their job, building new skills and growing their career. The Signet team member training experience is defined by Signet’s seven leadership traits: (1) Vision and Purpose; (2) Critical Thinking; (3) Customer Obsession; (4) Employee Experience; (5) Diversity, Equity & Inclusion; (6) Innovative Action; and (7) Performance Excellence.

None of our employees in the UK and North America are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

MARKETS
Signet operates in the US, Canada and UK markets.
US
Based on industry and transaction data from MasterCard and market research company The NPD Group, we estimate that the total US jewelry and watch market declined by 5% in 2022, from $69 billion in the prior year to $65 billion in 2022. This implies a Signet jewelry and watch market share of 9.7%, a 40 basis-points increase from the previous year. Since 2013, the industry average annual growth rate is 2%. Around 85% of the market is represented by jewelry, with the balance being attributable to watches. According to the latest data from the Jewelers Board of Trade, as of December 2022 there were approximately 17,900 jewelry stores in the country, down 2% from the prior year.
Canada
The average of the most recent Canada jewelry and watch market estimates published by Euromonitor in December 2022 and Statista in June 2022 was approximately $5.7 billion CAD (adjusted to exclude Quebec), an increase of 5% from the previous year. From 2022 through 2026, based on the average of the above sources, the market is expected to grow at a 3% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”).
UK
In the UK, the jewelry and watch market was about £6.4 billion in 2022 based on the average of estimates published by Euromonitor in February 2023, Statista in June 2022 and Mintel in August 2022. This was up approximately 9% over the prior year. From 2022 through 2026, based on the average of the above sources, the market is expected to grow at a 4% CAGR.

SEASONALITY
Signet’s business is seasonal, with the fourth quarter historically accounting for approximately 35-40% of annual sales, as well as for a substantial portion of the annual operating profit. The “Holiday Season” consists of results for the months of November and December, with December being the highest volume month of the year.
REGULATION
As a company with both US and international operations, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, covering areas such as consumer protection, consumer privacy, data protection, consumer credit, consumer credit insurance, health and safety, waste disposal, supply chain integrity, truth in advertising and employment. Signet monitors changes in these laws to maintain compliance with applicable requirements.
CLIMATE CHANGE
Signet recognizes that climate change poses a systemic risk to business operations.
Adverse effects of climate change, such as extreme weather events, particularly over a prolonged period of time, could negatively impact the Company’s business and results of operations if such conditions limit our consumers’ ability to access our stores, cause our consumers to limit discretionary spending, or disrupt our supply chains or distribution channels.
Adverse effects of climate change may increase the costs of diamond mining and diamond processing including cutting and polishing. Signet sources diamonds from around the world, and some locations may be more vulnerable to climate change. If the costs of natural diamonds increase, Signet may reallocate sourcing to lab-grown diamonds in line with customer preferences for cost and quality.
Signet has put a governance structure in place to monitor climate-change risks and adjust business operations accordingly. Two Board level committees at Signet are responsible for monitoring climate change risks: (1) the Audit Committee oversees risks across the Company; and (2) the Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability Committee oversees enterprise-wide policy regarding Signet’s 2030 Corporate Sustainability Goals, including Signet’s aspiration to shift business operations to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At the Company level, Signet’s Climate Action and Sustainability Committee (“CASC”) is a cross-functional committee with leaders across Signet’s business operations with the mandate of improving Signet’s data disclosures on climate and monitoring the progress of Signet’s climate-related Corporate Sustainability Goals. Signet’s greenhouse gas emission data is published in our annual Corporate Citizenship & Sustainability report, which is available on the Company’s website. Signet is in the process of instituting the policies and procedures required to disclose financial grade greenhouse gas emissions data to improve the overall quality and transparency in our reporting, as well as in preparation for proposed SEC climate-related disclosure rules in the event they are adopted.
