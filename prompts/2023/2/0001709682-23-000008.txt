Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Custom Truck One Source, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” “Custom Truck,” or “the Company”), a Delaware corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries are engaged in the business of providing a range of services and products to customers through rentals and sales of specialty equipment, rentals and sales of aftermarket parts and services related to the specialty equipment, and repair, maintenance, and customization services related to that equipment. 
We are a specialty equipment provider to the electric utility transmission and distribution, telecommunications, rail, forestry, waste management and other infrastructure-related industries in North America. Our core business relates to our new equipment inventory and rental fleet of specialty equipment that is utilized by service providers in infrastructure development and improvement work. We offer our specialized equipment to a diverse customer base, including utilities and contractors, for the maintenance, repair, upgrade, and installation of critical infrastructure assets, including distribution and transmission electric lines, telecommunications networks, and rail systems, as well as for lighting and signage. We rent, produce, sell, and service a broad range of new and used equipment, including bucket trucks, digger derricks, dump trucks, cranes, service trucks, and heavy-haul trailers. We manage our business in our three reporting segments: Equipment Rental Solutions (“ERS”), Truck and Equipment Sales (“TES”), and Aftermarket Parts and Services (“APS”). 
We operate with a differentiated “one-stop-shop” business model, offering equipment rental, new and used equipment sales, and aftermarket parts and service out of more than 35 locations across the U.S. and Canada. Customers receive additional support throughout the country from Custom Truck’s twenty-four hour, seven-day a week (“24/7”) call center, approximately 80 mobile technicians, and over 100 third-party locations. Custom Truck and its customers also benefit from its sophisticated sourcing model and large-scale integrated production and customization capabilities, which enhance the quality and diversity of its equipment offerings, reduce both cost and lead times for equipment sales and provide greater flexibility to optimize its rental fleet. These attributes, together with a strong reputation built over many years, position Custom Truck to capitalize on attractive secular growth trends across its end-markets. 
Custom Truck owns one of the industry’s largest fleets of specialty rental equipment focused on electric utility transmission and distribution (“T&D”), rail, telecommunications, and infrastructure end-markets through our ERS segment. As of December 31, 2022, our fleet is comprised of more than 10,000 units with an average unit age of approximately 3.7 years, which we believe is young by rental fleet standards and compares favorably to the long useful life of the equipment. Our rental fleet is managed on a national level, which allows us to efficiently reposition equipment in response to shifts in regional demand and thereby sustain strong utilization levels. 
As is customary among equipment rental companies, we sell used equipment out of our rental fleet to end user customers. We also offer a broad variety of new equipment for sale across our end-markets, often highly customized to meet its customers’ specific needs. Integrated production capabilities and extensive knowledge gained over a long history of selling equipment have positioned Custom Truck uniquely in the market as a trusted partner for customers seeking tailored solutions with short lead times. New and used equipment sales are accomplished through our TES segment.
Through our APS segment, we provide our customers a total job-site solution, offering a range of products for rent or sale to fully outfit their equipment and crews for activity in the field. Our comprehensive APS offering expands opportunities to serve our equipment rental and sales customers through the convenience of a single vendor for all their specialty equipment, tools and accessories needs.
End-Market Overview 
Our core end-markets include operators of vocational and specialty trucks and associated parts and services. These operators serve infrastructure-related electric utility T&D, telecom, rail, forestry, and waste management, among others.
General End-Market Trends 
The North American market has, and continues, to experience a secular shift from equipment ownership to rental. We believe that customers’ growing preference for equipment rental is driven by several factors including the avoidance of significant capital outlay, improved asset utilization, reduced storage and maintenance, access to a wider range of modern productive equipment, dedicated customer care, and operational efficiencies. We believe that the rental penetration rate will continue to trend towards the levels 
observed in the broader market, and we believe there will be significant growth within our specific markets. We purchase the majority of our chassis from several Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEM”) across our geographic footprint. The majority of our boom and crane components are sourced from selected suppliers. 
On November 6, 2021, the United States Congress passed, and the President of the United States signed, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “Infrastructure Act”). The Infrastructure Act was amended and renamed to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This amended version included approximately $1.2 trillion in spending in new and reallocated funds with positive impacts to each of our end-markets. 
Electric Utility T&D End-Market 
Maintaining safe and effective transmission and distribution lines is critical to national infrastructure, as they carry the electricity that powers the nation. Transmission lines carry high voltage electricity long distances, while distribution lines carry electricity from local transformers to houses and businesses. Additionally, as the economy “electrifies,” in pursuit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, electric reliability has become increasingly important. There will continue to be an increasing need for grid resiliency projects such as fire mitigation and storm hardening, and substantial renewable energy investments will be required in the electric transmission grid. From 2008 to 2020, compound annual growth rates for capital expenditures relating to transmission, distribution and solar were approximately 9%, 6% and 53%, respectively. Our specialty equipment is used for these projects, including the maintenance and repair of live lines and installation of new lines. Capital expenditure spend in the electric utility T&D end-market is approximately $65 billion annually. This spend is driven by a number of attractive dynamics, demonstrating that the U.S. is potentially in the very early stages of a multi-year electric utility T&D spending cycle.
Aging and Underinvested Electric Utility T&D Infrastructure - Electricity delivery in the U.S. depends on an aging and complex patchwork system of power generation facilities, transmission grids, local distribution lines, and substations. Most electric utility T&D lines were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s with a 50-year life expectancy and were not originally engineered to meet today’s load demands. The average age of the transmission system in the United States is well over 40 years, with 25% to 35% being greater than 50 or more years old. Due in part to this aging infrastructure, costly electric emergency incidents and disturbances have increased since 2000. Multiple costly fires have also been caused by aging and under-maintained transmission and distribution lines. The prevention of additional incidents associated with the continued operations of aging electric utility T&D infrastructure is expected to continue to drive increasing levels of maintenance and repair and replacement spend by utilities.
Changing Generation Landscape - The ongoing transition from coal to gas and renewables continues to drive changes in the generation landscape and transmission project development. In the last five years, 19 states have adopted greenhouse gas emission goals and renewable portfolio standards. The share of new renewables in the U.S. electricity generation mix has been on an upward trend in the last five years and is estimated to continue to increase through 2028. As a result, significant spend for new transmission lines will be required to interconnect these new sources of power with the electrical grid.
Increased Outsourcing by Utilities - Utilities are increasingly turning to specialized third-party contractors to fulfill construction and maintenance needs. This outsourcing trend is driven by the challenge of an aging workforce and desire to shift the management and responsibilities of non-core activities to external service providers. Outsourcing is a favorable trend for us, given our rental penetration among electric utility T&D contractors who prefer to rent due to lower initial capital outlay, increased flexibility, improved asset utilization and productivity, and significantly reduced storage and maintenance costs.
The Infrastructure Act includes $7.5 billion to build a national network of electric vehicle chargers and $65 billion to upgrade power infrastructure. 
Telecom End-Market 
Telecommunications infrastructure, including telecom cells, towers, and wirelines, are the backbone of telephonic interaction and the transportation of mobile data. We provide the specialty equipment required to maintain and install telecom cells, towers, and communication lines. Construction spend on telecommunications infrastructure has exceeded approximately $80 billion annually in recent years. This spend is expected to continue to grow due largely to the advent of 5G technology, which requires existing cell sites add equipment to support new frequencies. 5G technology will require the installation of numerous higher bandwidth small cells to “densify” wireless networks and enhance performance. This is because small cells only deliver coverage within approximately a quarter mile of their location, compared to approximately five miles for the existing 4G and predecessor macro cells. As a result, approximately 20 times more small cells will need to be installed in order to provide the same level of coverage as the existing macro cells.
Rapid technological advancements, including advanced digital and video service offerings, continue to increase demand for greater wireline and wireless network capacity and reliability. Data traffic is at an all-time high and is expected to increase in the future. North America data traffic is expected to grow at a 21% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2022 to 2028. 
The spend required by the key telecom operators to deploy 5G technology is expected to grow at a 47.6% CAGR from 2022 to 2030, of approximately $198 billion. The Infrastructure Act provided an additional $65 billion to increase access to reliable high-speed internet. 
Rail End-Market 
Freight and commuter rail are responsible for transporting products and people across North America. Our rail mounted equipment is used for a variety of tasks including the installation of new rail and maintenance of the existing rail lines. Ontario Limited (d/b/a HiRail Leasing), Ontario Inc. (d/b/a Heavy Equipment Repairs), and Ontario Limited (d/b/a Northshore Rail Contracting) (collectively “HiRail”) equipment is utilized in projects for both installation and repair of track, electric lines, signal crossings, and signs. The equipment is also often used for working on older infrastructure such as repairing bridges and terminals with more antiquated track and systems that are in need of upgrades with more modern systems like Positive Train Control (“PTC”) and others. The six largest public railroads operating in North America spend more than $10 billion annually in capital expenditures. Such capital expenditures are expected to continue to grow as freight demands increase. In addition to freight rail, spend on active commuter rail projects is significant with a growing pipeline.
Freight Rail - Freight rail, one of the most cost-effective, energy-efficient modes of transport, and carries a majority of intercity freight as measured by ton-miles, more than any other mode of transportation. Our North American customers are principally Class I railroads and related contractors. These Class I operators accounted for approximately 67% of total railroad route miles in 2019.
Commuter Rail - Trends such as population growth, increasing urbanization, a focus on sustainability, environmental awareness, and increasing highway congestion are expected to drive continued investment in commuter rail. Furthermore, as a result of years of insufficient funding, transit systems across the U.S. are struggling to cope with aging infrastructure, creating and increasing backlog. The most recent federal estimates quantify the backlog of projects required to attain a “state of good repair,” meaning public transit is repaired to an age within its average service life, at $90 billion — projected to grow to $122 billion by 2032.
The Infrastructure Act provides $39 billion to modernize transportation and an additional $89.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transportation along with an additional $66 billion of funding specifically earmarked for passenger rail services. 
Infrastructure End-Market
We also serve the general infrastructure end-market, which includes surface transportation, national highway performance, highway safety, metropolitan transit, and other key infrastructure systems, including residential and non-residential waste and water. Total infrastructure capex spend annually exceeds $200 billion, and we believe the infrastructure end-market outlook remains positive. 
We consider the waste end-market as part of the general infrastructure industry. Long-term, secular growth in this market is driven by growing waste volumes generated by increasing waste generation per capita. Population and income growth drive municipal solid waste generation. Municipal solid waste revenue is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 3.3% from 2020 to 2027. Waste is generally considered to be a recession-resistant industry given the non-discretionary nature of waste collection and disposal. Ongoing consolidation amongst waste haulers results in increasing market share for large, well-capitalized companies that have the resources to invest in the latest trucks and equipment.
The Infrastructure Act provides $55 billion to expand access to clean drinking water for households, businesses, schools, and child care centers across the United States through many programs starting in 2021, over a 5 year period.

Every incident is investigated and, based on the findings, our safety team implements processes and procedures to prevent recurrences and remediate known hazards.
We offer competitive pay and a comprehensive benefit program including medical, vision, dental, life and disability insurance to attract and retain top talent. We offer employees options to create financial security through our 401(k) savings program that includes a Company matching component, health savings account, and pre-tax flexible spending accounts for healthcare and dependent care.
We provide employees and their family members 24/7 access to doctors and counselors with telemedicine and virtual counseling. In addition, we offer an employee assistance program that provides employees and their family members with confidential support on a 
wide variety of areas to support total well-being—such as mental and emotional health conditions, stress management, dependent/elder care, nutrition, fitness, and legal and financial issues.
Legal Proceedings and Insurance
From time to time, we are subject to various lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, the vast majority of which arise out of the ordinary course of business. The nature of our business is such that disputes related to vehicles and accidents occasionally arise. We assess these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise and we establish reserves as and if required, based on our assessment of exposure. We have insurance policies to cover general liability, product, and workers’ compensation related claims. Management believes that none of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
