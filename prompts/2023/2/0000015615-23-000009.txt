Industry Trends
Our industry is composed of national, regional and local companies that provide services to customers in a range of industries. We believe the following industry trends affect demand for our services: 
Opportunities in our Communications Segment
Rapid innovation in service offerings to data consumers continues to increase demand for faster and more reliable wireless and wireline/fiber communications network services. Network data traffic is experiencing significant and accelerating levels of growth from increased usage of mobile devices, advancements in the “Internet of Things (IoT)” and a significant increase in the use of mobile and remote technologies. New and upgraded networks will be required to meet the increased level of data traffic from video and streaming technologies, ‘smart’ technologies, artificial intelligence and other technologies and advanced data services, including video surveillance, robotics, drones, digital health applications and autonomous vehicles, among others. 
Telecommunications companies are projected to play a significant role in shaping the future as next generation 5G wireless technology gains traction among both businesses and consumers. 5G, the next generation of wireless and fixed wireless network capacity, is expected to provide a platform for the IoT, which can be harnessed to drive innovation and improvements in commerce, transportation, supply chain, research, healthcare, education, public safety, the development of “Smart Cities,” “Smart Homes” and “Smart Farming,” among many other applications. 5G is expected to provide businesses with significant real-time visibility, insight and control over assets, products and services, with the potential to transform how businesses operate and deliver new products and services.
In response to these growing opportunities, communications service providers (“CSPs”) are expanding, densifying and optimizing current 5G wireless and wireline/fiber communications network capacity. To achieve nationwide coverage levels, changes to the structure of the network architecture for 5G wireless communications will require a longer period of installation when compared to past generation wireless infrastructure changes. Large scale 5G deployments, which are ongoing and expected to continue over the next several years, will include additional and improved tower capacity, as well as deployment of numerous higher bandwidth small/micro cells, distributed antenna systems and fiber network expansion to densify network performance. We believe that continued nationwide 5G tower deployments and deployment of small/micro cells and fiber network 
expansion by major carriers in support of 5G will lead to growing demand for 5G telecommunications infrastructure over multiple years. The Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) recent Facilitate America’s Superiority in 5G Technology, or “FAST” Plan, has made spectrum available to the market and is expected to encourage implementation of and investment in 5G technology across the United States by streamlining regulatory processes and updating infrastructure policies. In addition, there are several recent initiatives designed to drive development of telecommunications and 5G infrastructure in rural areas. 
We believe that there will be significant fiber network expansion resulting from the combination of carrier spend and government programs that are expected to incentivize private investment in telecommunications infrastructure. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”) was signed into law in November 2021 and provides approximately $65 billion of funding to improve and expand the nation’s broadband infrastructure and to make broadband more affordable for low-income Americans, including the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (“BEAD”) Program. BEAD will provide over $42 billion to expand high-speed internet access by funding planning, infrastructure deployment and adoption programs, with priority for unserved and underserved areas. Other government programs include the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (“RDOF”), which will make over $20 billion in funding available to build and connect gigabit broadband speeds in unserved rural areas, and the 5G Fund for Rural America, which will provide up to $9 billion in funding through 2030 to bring 5G wireless broadband connectivity to rural America. Additionally, carriers are also investing in telecommunications infrastructure to expand their fiber footprint across the nation. One such example is the recently announced AT&T and BlackRock Alternatives joint venture, Gigapower LLC (“Gigapower”), which will operate a commercial fiber-optic platform in the Unites States. Gigapower plans to deploy its network to an initial 1.5 million customer locations outside of AT&T’s traditional wireline service presence. 
The market for Smart City initiatives, in which cities use IoT technologies, artificial intelligence and cloud storage to collect and use insights gained from data to manage city assets, resources and services more efficiently, is a developing trend that is expected to accelerate due to the combination of increased data speeds and data capacity capabilities of wireless and wireline networks and developing IoT applications. Smart City initiatives include such technologies as Wi-Fi kiosks, smart lighting solutions, utility meters, smart traffic management systems, video sensors, weather sensors, drone sensors for public safety efforts and radio frequency identification sensors in the pavement. Grand View Research, in their 2023-2030 Smart Cities Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis report, estimated that the global Smart Cities market size was valued at approximately $1.3 billion in 2022, and is expected to grow at an estimated compound annual growth rate of approximately 26% from 2023 to 2030. 
Smart Home technologies represent a wide range of solutions for monitoring, controlling and automating functions in a home. These technologies are expected to benefit from the global rollout of 5G and improvements in Wi-Fi technologies, which are revolutionizing the delivery of IoT services. Demand for smart home solutions is expected to increase significantly as consumers look to add smart home technologies such as connected cameras, video doorbells and security systems, lighting and energy management solutions and entertainment controls. Mordor Intelligence predicts that the Smart Home market will grow from approximately $80 billion in 2021 to approximately $315 billion in 2027. We believe that opportunities for installation and maintenance of both Smart City and Smart Home technologies will provide future growth opportunities, including for our install-to-the-home services business.
We believe that we are well-positioned, as one of the largest providers of communications infrastructure services, to substantially benefit from the expected multi-year significant and broad opportunities in the telecommunications market as previously described.
Opportunities in our Clean Energy and Infrastructure Segment
Climate change initiatives, including a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions, continue to drive trends in the mix of fuel sources used in energy generation toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. According to Deloitte’s Industry Outlooks 2021: Power, Utilities & Renewables report, businesses, states, cities and utilities have announced decarbonization plans, with many utilities and their customers announcing and accelerating plans to fully decarbonize over the next three decades. Demand for clean energy power sources continues to grow, with renewables reporting rising levels of usage and capacity, as well as declining costs as a result of innovations that have reduced the manufacturing costs of wind turbines and solar panels. According to a January 2023 publication by BloombergNEF, global investment in low-carbon energy transition projects totaled $1.1 trillion in 2022, a 31% increase over 2021. Of the total 2022 investment in low-carbon energy transition projects, renewable energy projects, including wind, solar and biofuels, totaled $495 billion, a 17% increase over 2021. 
Additionally, growing corporate initiatives for smaller, standalone distributed generation facilities, together with regulatory and other policy initiatives at the federal, state and municipal levels, have spurred demand for clean energy production from sustainable power sources, including wind, solar and biomass. Currently, almost 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia and four territories, have adopted renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”) or renewable energy goals. States have created these standards to diversify their energy resources, promote domestic energy production and encourage economic development. Rising state renewable portfolio standards, increasing levels of corporate and residential demand, and improving economic competitiveness of renewable sources continue to be key drivers for their growth. In addition, growing efforts to address electric grid resiliency are expected to drive growth in renewables, as utilities and their customers increasingly consider renewable microgrids combined with energy storage solutions to support critical facilities. 
The transition to a renewable energy economy is expected to require rapid transformation of, and significant investment in, the power sector. According to BloombergNEF’s January 2023 publication, energy transition and grid investment will need to triple to approximately $4.5 trillion from 2023 to 2030 to achieve the global net zero goals called for in the Paris Climate Agreement. Recent governmental and policy initiatives are expected to drive growth in renewable energy infrastructure. The IIJA includes funding for renewable energy innovation and deployment. Included within the $65 billion allocated to power infrastructure and energy programs is funding for fuels and technology investment, including carbon initiatives, clean energy technology supply chains, including battery power initiatives, solar energy research and development, and the development and deployment of hydrogen from clean energy sources, among others. In addition, the August 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) contains provisions that are designed to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, reduce carbon emissions, lower energy prices and support the development of a reliable and affordable energy sector. The IRA provides almost $370 billion in clean energy funding to facilitate the clean energy transition, primarily in the form of tax incentives, grants and loan guarantees. Among the clean energy and climate provisions is approximately $70 billion of incentives over the next decade, including extensions of the renewable energy production tax credit and the investment 
tax credit for solar and other energy technologies, as well as production tax credits and investment tax credits for the qualified production of clean hydrogen and other clean fuels. 
As a result of the trends and factors discussed above, we expect a continuing increase in demand for construction of renewable and other clean energy infrastructure in the coming years. In addition, we believe that replacement and repowering of existing wind turbines and foundations with next generation, higher efficiency turbines, as well as maintenance of aging wind farms, will provide increased opportunities for wind infrastructure projects.
We also provide heavy civil infrastructure construction services, including the construction and maintenance of buildings, roads, bridges, water/sewer systems and other civil infrastructure. We believe that initiatives to upgrade and replace aging infrastructure, along with policy incentives such as the IIJA, will lead to increased investment and future growth opportunities in this area. The IIJA includes approximately $110 billion of funding for roads and bridges, including $40 billion of funding for bridge repair, replacement and rehabilitation and $16 billion of funding for other major infrastructure projects, as well as approximately $50 billion of funding for water infrastructure, including for weatherization efforts to reduce the impact of climate change and to protect against droughts and floods.
We believe that industrial plant construction opportunities exist in a wide variety of industries, including in the renewable energy industry, as power companies explore ways to reduce their carbon footprint. We expect that the need for baseload backup power generation, coupled with the relative low price and environmental advantage of cleaner burning natural gas will continue to drive demand for gas-fired electrical generating plants. In addition, the transition to clean energy is driving recent trends to convert coal-fired power plants to lower carbon fuel sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, biofuel, biomass, hydrogen or a combination thereof. Coal-fired power plants are also being converted into battery storage facilities for renewable energy. A wide variety of industries may seek to expand, convert or construct new plants to take advantage of more economical, cleaner, lower cost and lower carbon fuel sources. Converting existing power plants to renewable sources is an attractive option, given that existing power plants have the electric infrastructure, including the power lines, transformers and other equipment that is required to connect the power to the grid. Additionally, the IRA includes incentives that could help accelerate this trend by improving the economics of the coal-to-clean energy transition, in particular for communities with an existing coal power plant, as the IRA provides for an incremental tax credit for new renewable projects, as well as a new tax credit for battery storage projects. Industrial facilities and power plants in the biofuels/biomass, food processing, lithium recycling, natural gas and related industries present opportunities as additional domestic energy reserves are produced, transported and processed. 
We are one of the leading renewable contractors in North America, with expertise in wind, solar and biomass, as well as a leading contractor in the construction of industrial and other power plants and heavy civil infrastructure, and we expect to benefit from market trends in these industries.
Opportunities in our Power Delivery Segment
The U.S. electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure, referred to as “the grid,” is composed of a network of electric generating facilities, high voltage transmission lines, substations and distribution lines that bring power to homes and businesses. The grid will continue to require significant ongoing maintenance, upgrade and expansion to continue delivery of reliable and affordable power. This will include strengthening aging infrastructure, addressing future grid resiliency and modernization efforts (“Smart Grid”) and adapting to changing energy supply, population shifts and distribution requirements, including the impact of the shift toward electric vehicle technologies. According to a June 2022 IBIS World report, U.S. industry revenue for construction and repair work on electric power transmission infrastructure was projected to approximate $48.2 billion in 2022. We expect future growth in electric transmission and distribution infrastructure from projects to digitize, modernize, harden and secure the grid against increasing levels of disruption from natural and man-made disasters, including extreme weather events, wildfires and potential cyber-attacks, as well as to address changing energy supply requirements and grid reliability. 
In addition, clean energy production trends are expected to lead to increased investment in electric infrastructure, with a changing fuel mix that is moving toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as natural gas and renewables. In recent years, many utilities and their customers have announced plans to fully decarbonize over the next three decades. Power grid investment will be a key component of the low-carbon energy transition that is currently underway. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2022, the percentage of U.S. electricity generated by renewable sources is expected to double to over 40% by 2050, with renewable electric generating technologies expected to represent approximately 60% of new capacity additions through 2050. 
The expected growth in electrical power generation from renewable energy sources will require significant investment in transmission lines, as wind, solar and other renewable power generation resources are typically located in remote areas of the country, far from industrial users and major population centers. Growth in electrical power generation from renewable sources in the U.S. will require grid updates to provide for storage of electricity from renewable energy sources and capabilities that can accommodate supply and demand for these new energy sources. BloombergNEF reported almost $275 billion of global power grid investment in 2022. Future demand for electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure is also expected to result from ‘Smart Utility’ initiatives, which seek to address growing populations, environmental goals and the need to optimize resources, as well as electric vehicles, as consumers and automakers increasingly shift toward electric vehicle technologies. According to a BloombergNEF January 2023 publication, global investment in electrified transport infrastructure grew to approximately $465 billion in 2022, an increase of over 50% from 2021. In its report, BloombergNEF predicts that energy transition and grid investment will need to triple to approximately $4.5 trillion from 2023 to 2030 to achieve global net zero goals, with electrified transport, renewable energy and grid investment representing the largest energy transition investment opportunities. 
These trends, along with governmental climate change policy initiatives toward net zero carbon emissions, as well as the recently passed IIJA and IRA programs, which are designed to incentivize investment in clean energy technologies for power generation, are expected to drive significant future investment in electric infrastructure. The IIJA includes approximately $65 billion for upgrades to power infrastructure, research and development of transmission and electricity distribution technologies and smart grid technologies. The funding is focused on grid reliability and security, renewable energy innovation and deployment, and ensuring supply chains critical for energy innovation. The IIJA also includes $7.5 billion for investment in a national network of electric vehicle chargers. In addition, among the key provisions of the IRA is funding to address climate 
change, beginning with a rapid transition in the nation’s energy system to cleaner sources of electric power generation. The IRA includes billions of dollars in tax incentives, grants and loan programs to support the development, and accelerate deployment of, clean energy power projects, including for energy generation, energy manufacturing, clean fuels, clean vehicles and energy efficiency. 
We believe significant capital investment in the transmission and distribution system will be required to meet the above-mentioned infrastructure requirements, and that we are well-positioned to benefit from these developing trends.
Opportunities in our Oil and Gas Segment
We are one of the largest pipeline contractors in North America, with a balanced portfolio of service offerings, including union and non-union services. Our pipeline offerings include construction and maintenance services for pipeline distribution, including for natural gas pipelines, carbon capture sequestration, water pipelines and pipeline integrity services, including replacement and rehabilitation of aging infrastructure for the energy and utilities industries. 
We expect that natural gas power generation will remain a fuel of choice for both primary power generation and baseload backup power generation to support intermittent clean energy sources, and that this trend will drive the growth of natural gas as a source of base load lower-carbon power generation, both in the U.S. and abroad. According to the DOE’s Annual Energy Outlook 2022, natural gas is expected to approximate 35% of U.S. electricity generation by 2050, and natural gas-powered sources are expected to represent approximately 40% of new capacity additions through 2050, the second largest source behind renewable technologies. We believe that trends in natural gas power generation will require continued construction of pipeline infrastructure to provide fuel safely and efficiently to these facilities. In addition, demand for liquified natural gas (“LNG”) exports has risen in recent years, with the U.S. having exported more LNG than any other country as of July 2022, according to a September 2022 publication by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This continued trend is expected to drive construction of pipeline infrastructure for the transport of LNG to coastal export facilities in North America. Additionally, we believe that gas utility distribution spending for replacement and rehabilitation of aging infrastructure will accelerate over the next several years due to regulatory, sustainability and safety concerns. Similarly, we expect that aging pipeline infrastructure will increasingly require replacement lines and pipeline integrity services as our customers look to enhance the safety, productivity and lives of existing infrastructure.
Additionally, recent trends toward decarbonization and carbon emission reductions in connection with the low-carbon energy transition are driving demand for carbon capture sequestration technologies as well as the use of hydrogen as a clean energy power source. Pipeline infrastructure is expected to play a key role in the transformation to low-carbon energy sources and we believe that we are well positioned to support these developing market trends. The IIJA includes funding for carbon initiatives, including for carbon capture technologies, and the IRA also provides incentives and provisions for hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization and sequestration technologies. 
We believe that the above-mentioned trends will support continued levels of future project activity across multiple service offerings we provide and that we are well-positioned to benefit from these trends.

Climate change mitigation and environmental initiatives. We are committed to minimizing the effects of our operations on the climate and the environment and endeavor to reduce our carbon footprint, energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. We seek to foster conservation and environmental awareness within our operations, and we endeavor to identify and incorporate energy, carbon and water efficiency considerations into our project planning and execution. We understand the importance of tracking and managing climate-related matters, including greenhouse gas emissions. We are evaluating processes that will enable us to measure and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities on an enterprise-wide basis. We have implemented GPS, smart idling and other advanced technologies in approximately 80% of our vehicle fleet operations to improve fleet efficiency, fuel consumption and safety. Additionally, certain of our operations have invested in equipment containing advanced emissions reduction technologies, helping to reduce our carbon footprint.
Community and Social Matters
At MasTec, we are proud to serve the communities in which we operate. Partnering with our communities and our customers is fundamental to our business operations. We plan and act for the future, for the long-term good of our company, our customers and our communities. We are active in our local communities and participate in charitable giving, community outreach and community building programs, including disaster relief efforts for communities affected by hurricanes, flooding and similar events. We also have an unwavering commitment to our team 
members in times of need. In addition to community outreach programs, we seek to develop strong relationships with our local communities, businesses, subcontractors and suppliers, and we have been recognized for our efforts in community and outreach programs by various organizations.
We place a significant priority on respectful collaboration with our local communities, including indigenous communities, and we utilize indigenous community subcontractors and suppliers within our operations. We support our local communities by utilizing local businesses for goods and services, including for project crews and office operations, and we are active members of our local chambers of commerce and economic development organizations. Our community outreach programs include programs tailored to military veterans, who represented approximately 4% of our workforce in 2022.
Leadership and Governance
Integrity, honesty, and fairness are at the heart of our Company. Our leadership team and Board of Directors are committed to fostering a strong organizational culture built upon accountability, business and personal ethics, integrity and compliance. We believe that an ethical culture builds credibility and trust. We hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards of professionalism, and respect the opinions, ideas and perspectives of our team members, customers, subcontractors, suppliers and those in the communities we serve. Among the ethical matters addressed in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are our policies on discrimination and harassment, ethical and fair business practices and compliance with insider trading policies, anti-bribery and anti-corruption guidelines and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Training programs related to governance matters are routinely provided at intervals based on an employee’s position and responsibilities. We also expect our subcontractors and suppliers to maintain proper business conduct and ethics protocols.
Governance Principles and Shareholder Alignment. We seek to align the interests of our Board of Directors and management with those of our shareholders and other stakeholders, and we believe that an independent, well-diversified Board is an essential attribute of effective Board governance. Diverse backgrounds are integral to effective governance, risk management and business opportunity assessments, which are key components of creating long-term value. Our Board has racial, ethnic and gender diversity, with approximately 63% of our Board representing women or minorities as of December 31, 2022. Our Board also has a diverse skill set, including members with executive leadership, financial, risk management, health and safety and relevant industry expertise.
Our management team and our Board of Directors have significant ownership in MasTec’s common stock, which further aligns their interests with those of our other shareholders.  Our single class capital structure is grounded on the “one-share, one-vote” principle, which we believe is aligned with strong corporate governance standards. We have detailed governance procedures, including our Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter and our Nominating, Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee Charter. These charters, as well our comprehensive Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Board of Director Governance Principles, can be viewed on the “Investors” page of our website at MasTec.com.
Risk Mitigation Practices. We believe that responsible corporate governance requires great attention to potential business and other risks. As part of our corporate risk mitigation strategy, we regularly assess potential risks and hazards within our business and operations, including potential risks associated with climate change. Risk assessments are performed on an ongoing basis at both the organizational and at the project level. We also apply a risk-based approach with respect to cyber security. We are committed to the privacy of employee, customer and company information and undertake significant efforts to protect this information. We continually evaluate cyber risks to properly safeguard our systems and business operations.
Sustainability and Climate-Related Governance. The Nominating, Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight of sustainability-oriented matters for MasTec, including overseeing MasTec’s approach to considering, evaluating and integrating climate-related risks and opportunities into MasTec’s business strategy and decision-making processes. This Committee is also responsible for considering MasTec’s material sustainability issues, discussing associated risks with the full Board and management and reviewing and considering whether MasTec has appropriate policies, processes, strategies and initiatives in place to address such matters, including climate-related risks and opportunities. The potential implications and financial impact of the climate-related risks and opportunities remains uncertain, but we recognize that these risks and opportunities could be significant to our business. We regularly assess our business risks and opportunities, and we are working to develop our processes to assess the potential effects and magnitude of climate-related risks and opportunities on our operations, financial results and key business strategies, as guided by the recommendations of the TCFD.
Strategy
The key elements of our business strategy are as follows: 
Focus on Growth Opportunities. We believe that our end-markets offer multiple growth opportunities, and we expect continued spending by key customers in many of the industries we serve. We expect development of wireless and wireline/fiber infrastructure; development of clean energy infrastructure; expansion, maintenance and upgrades of power delivery infrastructure, including electrical and gas transmission lines and distribution networks; development of pipeline infrastructure, including carbon capture technologies and pipeline integrity work; and heavy civil and industrial infrastructure construction projects to be areas of investment and opportunity in the coming years. We intend to use our broad geographic presence, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, customer relationships and full range of services to capitalize on these trends and grow our business. 
Operational Excellence. We seek to effectively manage our projects and services to maintain appropriate profit margins and cash flows. We also strive to identify opportunities for leverage within our business, such as deploying resources across multiple customers and projects in order to enhance our operating effectiveness and utilization rates. We also seek to maintain strong working capital management practices. Our management team pursues actions and programs designed to achieve these goals, such as increasing accountability throughout our organization, effectively managing customer contract bidding procedures, evaluating opportunities to improve our working capital cycle time, hiring and retaining experienced operating and financial professionals, and developing, expanding and integrating the use of financial systems and information technology capabilities within our business.
Effective Capital Structure Management. We have made significant investments in transformational acquisition activities over the past few years, including the acquisition of IEA in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the acquisitions of HMG, and INTREN, LLC (“INTREN”) in 2021. We achieved an investment grade credit rating in 2021 and have maintained this investment grade rating despite the increase in our leverage during 2022, primarily to finance the acquisition of IEA. We expect to manage our capital structure in the future to maintain this credit rating and we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund our planned operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $861 million of borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility, with aggregate borrowing commitments of approximately $2.3 billion under our senior unsecured credit facility. We may consider opportunities to refinance, repurchase or retire outstanding debt as part of our ongoing capital structure evaluation. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Summary of Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources,” for details pertaining to recent capital structure activities.
Leverage Core Performance and Expertise through Strategic Acquisitions. We pursue selected acquisitions, investments and strategic arrangements that allow us to expand our operations, service offerings, customer base or geographic reach. We have diversified our business and expanded our service offerings and geographic footprint in recent years, both organically and through acquisitions. For discussion of our recent acquisitions, see Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business,” which is incorporated by reference. In our efforts to maximize the potential of the businesses we acquire, we work to integrate them into our operations and internal control environment in a timely and efficient manner. We evaluate our business and operations on a regular basis, and from time to time, we may divest certain businesses or assets or curtail selected business activities or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margin or those that no longer fit within our long-term business strategy.
Services
Our core services are the engineering, building, installation, maintenance and upgrade of infrastructure, primarily for communications, power generation and utilities customers. We provide similar services to each of these customers, including: 
Build. We build infrastructure projects for customers across a range of industries. We specialize in building underground and overhead distribution systems, including trenches, conduits, cell towers, fiber, cable and power lines that provide wireless and wireline/fiber communications; clean energy infrastructure, including for renewable energy power generation; pipeline infrastructure, including for natural gas, carbon capture sequestration and other product transport; power delivery services, including electrical and gas transmission and distribution systems; industrial and heavy civil infrastructure; compressor and pump stations and treatment plants; and water infrastructure, including water pipelines.
Install. We install electrical and gas distribution and transmission systems, power generation facilities, buried and aerial fiber optic and other cables, and provide various install-to-the-home products and services, including home automation and energy management solutions in a variety of environments for our customers. In connection with our installation work, we deploy and manage network connections that involve our customers’ hardware, software and network equipment.
Maintain and Upgrade. We offer 24 hour/365 days-a-year maintenance and upgrade support to our customers. Our comprehensive service offerings include the regular maintenance of our customers’ distribution facilities, networks and infrastructure, including communications, power generation, pipeline, electrical distribution and transmission and industrial and heavy civil infrastructure. We also provide emergency services for service restoration following natural disasters and accidents, and we perform environmental planning, compliance and remediation. Our upgrade work ranges from routine replacements and upgrades to major overhauls.
Customers
We have longstanding relationships with many customers, and often provide services under master service and other service agreements, which are generally multi-year agreements. Our master service agreements are typically exclusive up to a specified dollar amount per work order for each defined geographic area, but do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. Work performed under master service and other service agreements is usually generated through work orders, each of which is performed for a fixed fee. Services provided under these agreements range from engineering, project management and installation work to maintenance and upgrade services. Master service and other service agreements are frequently awarded on a competitive bidding basis, although customers are sometimes willing to negotiate contract extensions beyond their original terms without re-bidding. Our master service and other service agreements have various terms, depending upon the nature of the services provided, and typically provide for termination on short or no advance notice. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue derived from projects performed under master service and other service agreements totaled 51%, 38% and 36%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. 
The remainder of our work is generated pursuant to contracts for specific projects or jobs requiring the construction and installation of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an entire infrastructure system. Customers are billed with varying frequency, the timing of which is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Under the typical payment terms of master and other service agreements and contracts for specific projects, the customer makes progress payments based on quantifiable measures of performance as defined in the agreements. Some of our contracts include retainage provisions, under which a portion of the contract amount (generally, from 5% to 10% of billings) can be retained by the customer until final contract settlement. 
We believe that our industry experience, technical expertise, broad service capabilities and reputation for customer service, as well as the relationships developed between our customers and our senior management and project management teams are important to our being retained by our customers. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information and Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which are incorporated by reference, for customer concentration information. 
Backlog
Estimated backlog represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 18 months from future work on uncompleted construction contracts, including new contracts under which work has not begun, as well as revenue from change orders and renewal options. Our estimated backlog also includes amounts under master service and other service agreements and our proportionate share of estimated revenue from proportionately consolidated non-controlled contractual joint ventures. Estimated backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, anticipated seasonal impacts, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. Based on current expectations of our customers’ requirements, we anticipate that we will realize approximately 75% of our estimated year-end 2022 backlog in 2023. The following table presents 18-month estimated backlog by reportable segment as of the dates indicated:

Reportable Segment (in millions): | December 31, 2022 | | September 30, 2022 | | December 31, 2021 (a)
Communications | $ | 5,303 | | | $ | 5,024 | | $ | 4,583
Clean Energy and Infrastructure | 3,227 | | | 1,933 | | | 1,543
Oil and Gas | 1,740 | | | 1,513 | | | 1,171
Power Delivery | 2,709 | | | 2,757 | | | 2,642
Other | — | | | — | | | — 
Estimated 18-month backlog | $ | 12,979 | | | $ | 11,227 | | $ | 9,939

(a) Backlog as of December 31, 2021 was recast during the first quarter of 2022 to conform with the change in segment reporting for the HMG acquisition, the effect of which was a decrease in Power Delivery segment backlog of $223.0 million, and an increase in backlog for the Communications and Oil and Gas segments of $79.0 million and $144.0 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2022, 56% of our backlog is estimated to be attributable to amounts under master service or other service agreements, pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services. Most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Timing of revenue for construction and installation projects included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of customer, regulatory or other delays or cancellations, including from economic or other conditions, including supply chain disruptions, inflationary effects, climate-related matters, potential recessionary uncertainty, political unrest, such as the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, effects of public health matters and/or other project-related factors. These effects, among others, could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. We occasionally experience postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work due to changes in our customers’ spending plans, market volatility, changes in governmental permitting, regulatory delays and/or other factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers’ requirements or that actual results will be consistent with the estimates included in our forecasts. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings. 
Backlog is a common measurement used in our industry. Our methodology for determining backlog may not, however, be comparable to the methodologies used by others. Backlog differs from the amount of our remaining performance obligations, which are described in Note 1 - Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. As of December 31, 2022, total 18-month backlog differed from the amount of our remaining performance obligations due primarily to the inclusion of $7.7 billion of estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements within our backlog estimates, as described above, and the exclusion of approximately $2.4 billion of remaining performance obligations and estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements in excess of 18 months, which amount is not included in the backlog estimates above. Backlog expected to be realized in 2023 differs from the amount of remaining performance obligations expected to be recognized for the same period due primarily to the inclusion of approximately $4.2 billion of estimated future revenue under master service and other service agreements that is included within the related backlog estimate.
Sales and Marketing
Our customers increasingly require resources from multiple disciplines. Therefore, our subsidiary services companies market their services not only individually, but also in combination with other companies, including other MasTec companies and independent companies, to provide what we believe are the most efficient and effective solutions to meet our customers’ demands. Through our unified MasTec® brand and an integrated organizational structure designed to permit rapid deployment of our services, we are able to quickly and efficiently allocate resources to meet customer needs. We offer services that are branded under the MasTec® service mark and other service marks. 
We have a business development and marketing plan emphasizing the MasTec® registered service mark and trade names of certain acquired companies, as well as an integrated service offering to position ourselves as a provider of a full range of service solutions, providing services including installation as well as sophisticated engineering, design and integration. We believe our longstanding relationships with customers and our reputation for reliability and efficiency facilitate our recurring business. Our marketing efforts are principally carried out by the management of our business units and project groups in coordination with our corporate business development organization. Our management team has many years of industry experience, both at the service provider level, and in some cases, with the customers we serve. Our business unit and project group managers market directly to existing and potential customers for new contracts and also seek our inclusion on lists of vendors invited to submit proposals for service agreements and individual projects. We also market our services in conjunction with certain business partners, strategic investments and arrangements. Our executive management supplements these efforts at the national level. 
Safety and Insurance/Risk Management
We have a proactive safety culture and we strive to instill and enforce safe work habits in our employees. Our employees are required to participate in training programs relevant to their employment, including all those required by law. We actively train our workforce in everyday 
safety practices and provide detailed guidelines that are required to be followed as work tasks are contemplated and completed. Training programs are tailored to an employee’s job function, responsibilities and level of experience and are designed in accordance with industry best practices and standards. We evaluate employees in part based upon their safety records and the safety records of the employees they supervise. Team members are responsible for preventing incidents, injuries and occupational illnesses, and our project leadership team is tasked with ensuring that projects are accomplished in a safe, productive, environmentally and quality-focused manner. Our business units have established robust safety programs to monitor and improve compliance with safety procedures and regulations, and through our risk management programs, we educate our staff, subcontractors and suppliers on safety matters. We strive continuously to assess and improve our safety programs and performance. We also provide training for other workplace and risk management programs, including for cyber security, workplace diversity and harassment, human trafficking awareness, emergency preparedness and other potential workplace hazards, among others. 
Our business involves the use of heavy equipment and exposure to potentially dangerous workplace conditions. While we are committed to operating safely and prudently, we are subject to claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage and personal injuries that occur in connection with our work. Our insurance policies are subject to high deductibles and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. We maintain insurance policies for workers’ compensation, general liability and automobile liability that are subject to per claim deductibles. In addition, we maintain excess umbrella coverage and an insurance policy with respect to employee group medical claims, which is subject to annual per employee maximum losses. We also manage certain of our insurance liabilities indirectly through our wholly-owned captive insurance companies, which reimburse claims up to the applicable insurance limits. We are required to post collateral to certain of our insurance carriers, generally in the form of letters of credit, surety bonds and cash. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
Suppliers, Materials and Working Capital
Under many of our contracts, our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation of, but not the cost or warranty of, those materials. Under certain other projects, we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third-party providers. We have not been dependent on any one vendor for project-related materials or supplies required for the projects we manage. We also depend on the availability of certain equipment to perform our services. We operate a diverse fleet of on-road and off-road equipment. Substantially all of our equipment is obtained from third-party vendors, and we are not dependent upon any single vendor for our equipment requirements. A number of factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or control could result in increased costs for, or delays in delivery of, materials and equipment, including supply chain disruptions.
In 2022, certain market-related supply chain disruptions affected our industry, and as a result, we increased our level of purchasing activity to secure the necessary materials and equipment to meet our project requirements. While we believe that we have taken steps to secure delivery of the materials and equipment required by our business operations and do not anticipate any significant disruptions with respect thereto, our operations could be negatively affected if the current supply chain disruptions continue or become worse. In addition, certain of our clean energy customers began experiencing regulatory-related supply chain issues in 2022 that have resulted in delays, shortages of, and increased costs for, the materials necessary to construct certain solar renewable projects, which could affect our ability to perform these projects in the near-term. 
We utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage our work flow. Our independent contractors typically provide their own vehicles, tools and insurance coverage. We are not dependent on any one independent contractor. We need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business, including the spending patterns of our customers and the effects of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work, both of which can influence the timing of spending to support related customer demand. See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources - Working Capital,” which is incorporated by reference. 
Competition
Our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. We compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate, ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms. Certain barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate, including adequate financial resources, technical expertise, high safety ratings, established customer relationships and a proven track record of operational success. Some of our customers employ their own personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide. We compete based upon our industry experience, technical expertise, financial and operational resources, geographic presence, industry reputation, safety record and reputation for customer service. While we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider, they award most of their work through a bid process, and price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected. 
Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally, including laws and regulations related to labor relations, wages, worker safety and environmental protection. While many of our customers operate in regulated industries (for example, utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), we are generally not subject to such regulation and oversight. In addition to environmental laws and regulations, our operations are subject to numerous other laws and regulations, among them: 
•    regulations related to worker safety and health, including those established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and state equivalents; 
•regulations related to vehicle registrations, including those of the states and the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”); 
•    contractor licensing requirements; 
•    permitting and inspection requirements;
•    building and electrical codes; and
•cyber data protection and security.
We are subject to numerous environmental laws, regulations and programs, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, laws governing emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges into air, surface water, groundwater and soil, and programs related to the protection of endangered species and critical habitats. Our pipeline-related activities require careful adherence to environmental regulations because such operations may have impacts on groundwater, surface waters and other environmentally sensitive areas. Similarly, our power delivery construction operations often require us to operate in remote areas involving environmentally sensitive habitats as well as areas that are subject to risk of wildfire.
We have a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilizes fuel. Any changes in laws requiring us to use equipment that runs on alternative power sources, could require a significant investment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. The presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business. 
In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations. Our contracts with customers may also impose liabilities on us regarding environmental issues that arise through the performance of our services. From time to time, we may incur unanticipated and substantial costs and obligations related to environmental compliance and/or remediation matters. We believe we have all material licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory and environmental requirements. We could, however, incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with such requirements.
Additionally, there are significant environmental regulations under consideration to address climate change, regulate emissions of greenhouse gases and encourage the use of clean energy technologies. We regularly monitor proposed regulations and legislation and have processes in place to adapt our business and operations, as necessary, to meet any such new requirements.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
We operate primarily in the United States and Canada. See Note 13 - Segments and Related Information in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, which is incorporated by reference. 
Human Capital Management
At MasTec, our employees are an integral part of our growth and success. MasTec began as a family business, and every member of the MasTec team is considered part of the MasTec family. The safety, health and welfare of our employees is at the heart of our operations. We are committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace and value the diverse and varied perspectives and experiences of our employees. We believe that our commitment to our employees, together with our team culture, fosters an environment of strong employee engagement. When our employees are safe, healthy and engaged, we are most productive. We believe that our employees and our customers benefit from the collective and well-coordinated efforts that result from effective employee engagement, teamwork and collaboration, which, in turn, allows us to deliver the highest level of excellence to our stakeholders. 
For the twelve month period ended December 31, 2022, we had an average of approximately 30,000 employees, of which approximately 7,000 were represented by unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements, and as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 32,000 employees, of which approximately 7,000 were represented by unions or were subject to collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 97% of our employees are located in the United States.
Safety. Safety is a core value at MasTec. It is a mindset that permeates all aspects of our operations, and an attitude that our employees exhibit, strongly and openly. We recognize the need of our workforce to have a safe workplace and are committed to maintaining a strong and sustainable safety culture within our organization. We continually evaluate our safety programs to protect our most important asset – our team members. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges in many parts of our business and operations, including with respect to keeping our employees safe. Accordingly, we adjusted our standard operating procedures within our business operations to ensure employee and customer safety and developed human resource guidance to assist our employees with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
We have a proactive safety culture, and our safety leadership structure is designed to create accountability within each of our businesses and at the corporate level. Our safety management process includes continuously monitoring, reporting and addressing our key safety performance indicators. Our “Zero Harm” culture is fundamental to our goal of world class safety performance, and we work to instill safety values in every team member, such that safe behavior becomes instinctive and automatic. We are driven by our commitment to safety and our “Zero Harm” culture to develop and implement safety programs and processes with safety excellence as our goal. We strive continuously to improve our safety performance and provide regular safety training and skill-level improvement programs, including: safety orientation for new employees, safety leadership training for our front-line leaders, OSHA construction outreach training, defensive driving and DOT training, operator qualification and electric worker training, excavation and ground penetration safety training, among others. We have adopted numerous safety initiatives throughout our organization, including fleet telematics applications. 
Through our risk management programs and other safety initiatives, we educate our staff, subcontractors and suppliers on safety matters. The high standards of safety, incident prevention and hazard control that we expect within our operations are also expected of our subcontractors and suppliers. We have memberships and participate in numerous safety and other organizations that promote industry safety. Our safety performance is periodically recognized by our customers as well as by safety organizations.
Health and Wellness. Encouraging good health and following a healthy lifestyle is a MasTec philosophy. We encourage all our employees to take an active role in living a healthy lifestyle and offer wellness tools and resources to help achieve and maintain good health. We offer a comprehensive and flexible benefits program, including medical, dental, vision and prescription insurance, as well as access to telehealth services, which were expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic to assist employees with medical and mental health matters. In addition, to help our employees build a financially secure future, we offer a 401(k) plan with matching benefits, an employee stock purchase plan, life and disability insurance plans and a flexible spending account to help employees cover medical expenses. We also offer employees support for personal and work-life issues, including health, legal and financial matters.
Professional and Career Development. We believe that professional development is essential to the success of our business, as it drives employee engagement and ensures that our team members have the requisite skills and training to deliver the highest level of excellence to our customers. Our employees’ career development begins with the onboarding process and continues throughout their careers. Ongoing training is designed to develop our employees’ technical, professional and leadership skills and is customized to meet the qualifications and requirements necessary for our employees to succeed in their positions. We invest significant resources in education, certification, training programs, and other professional development opportunities, including apprenticeship- and leadership-oriented training programs, tuition reimbursement for qualified training programs, sponsored attendance at industry conferences, departmental and divisional leadership conferences, employee training centers and advancement opportunities within and across businesses and divisions. We seek to develop and cultivate current and future leaders, and design our training programs to create high performing teams, improve productivity, positively affect employee motivation and retention and further enhance career development opportunities. We believe that our team culture, along with competitive salary and benefits packages and our focus on employee training and career development, including opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization, helps us to attract and retain a diverse and experienced workforce.
Team Culture, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Our success depends upon the success of our team, which requires us to have exceptional team members, as well as an exceptional team. Teamwork is part of our culture and is one of our core values. We believe that our employees and our customers benefit from the collective and well-coordinated efforts that result from effective employee engagement, teamwork and collaboration. We seek to foster an environment of strong employee engagement through our commitment to our employees and our team culture. A strong team culture, together with effective processes and people, allows us to consistently meet the needs of our customers and stakeholders. 
We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion in the workplace and to fostering an environment where our employees can freely bring diverse perspectives and varied experiences to work. We seek to attract the best talent and foster a culture of inclusion, teamwork, support and empowerment where all talented individuals have access to opportunities and can achieve success. Our commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, together with our culture of belonging allows us to recruit and retain highly talented employees so that we are able to deliver exceptional results to our customers. As of the date of our most recent EEO-1 report, which was certified in May 2022, 45% of our overall U.S. workforce and 45% of our U.S. executive, manager and professional workforce was represented by women and minorities. 
Certain of our businesses have incorporated the use of annual diversity assessments and goal setting targets to expand diversity within our management and employee teams, and we expect to continue in these efforts. A notable portion of our workforce includes military veterans, and we regularly engage in outreach programs tailored to military veterans.
