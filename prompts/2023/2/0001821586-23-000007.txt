Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing therapies to address significant unmet needs in inflammatory skin and joint diseases. Our novel tri-specific Nanobody, sonelokimab (“SLK”, also known as M1095/ALX 0761) is an IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor that has shown therapeutic activity as measured by psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores in patients with plaque-type psoriasis ("PsO"). The terms “Nanobody” and “Nanobodies” used herewith are registered trademarks of Ablynx N.V., Belgium, a Sanofi company (“Ablynx”). SLK is a proprietary Nanobody exclusively licensed from MHKDG.
We are developing a portfolio of therapeutic indications for SLK, and are focused on demonstrating its efficacy, safety and dosing convenience, initially in hidradenitis suppurativa ("HS") and psoriatic arthritis ("PsA"). We believe that SLK has a differentiated mechanism of action and potential to penetrate into deep skin and joint tissue. SLK’s purposefully designed molecular characteristics, including its smaller size compared to traditional monoclonal antibodies and its albumin binding site, are intended to facilitate deep tissue penetration in the skin and joints. We envision SLK as a key therapeutic alternative in our initial target indications and potentially in multiple other IL-17 driven inflammatory conditions. Building on the clinical data generated to date, we pursue the clinical development of SLK.
SLK was discovered by Ablynx, and was previously studied by MHKDG and Avillion LLP (“Avillion”) under a 2017 co-development agreement in a Phase 2b clinical trial in over 300 moderate-to-severe PsO patients.
We are developing SLK in inflammatory diseases in dermatology and rheumatology where the pathophysiology is known to be driven by IL-17A and IL-17F. This comprises our initial target diseases (HS and PsA) among several other inflammatory conditions (including PsO). Our initial target diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and we believe there is a need for improved treatment options. We are advancing Phase 2 trials for the therapeutic indications of HS and PsA, in both the United States and Europe. In May 2022, we initiated our Phase 2 trial of SLK in patients with moderate-to-severe HS (the MIRA trial (M1095-HS-201)), and in December 2022, we initiated our Phase 2 trial in patients with active PsA (the ARGO trial (M1095-PSA-201)). Enrollment into the MIRA trial was completed in February 2023, and we expect a primary endpoint readout in mid-2023. The ARGO trial has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) clearance and U.S. central Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) approval, and continues to meet enrollment targets.
Our Vision and Our Strategy
Our vision is to develop transformative therapies for inflammatory skin and joint diseases. Our strategy is centered on developing SLK as, to our knowledge, the first ever Nanobody in clinical development for our intentionally selected indications. We seek to accomplish this strategy by:
•Building the efficacy and safety profile of SLK for patients — Our Phase 2 programs encompass two therapeutic indications: HS and PsA (see “Business—Our Pipeline—Figure 1,” below). We began the MIRA trial for HS in May 2022 and completed enrollment of patients in February 2023. We began enrollment into the ARGO trial for PsA in December 2022. The clinical trials employ established therapeutic endpoints, such as response criteria defined by the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (“HiSCR”) and American College of Rheumatology (“ACR”), that reflect real-world improvement in patient outcomes. Upon successful completion of any Phase 2 program, we anticipate commencing Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Strengthening the differentiation elements for future SLK patients — In parallel with our Phase 2 trials, we conduct basic research to continue refining our understanding of SLK and Nanobody biology. This research will inform our clinical efforts and includes the study of SLK’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in a variety of cellular, deep-tissue, and disease models (in vitro and in vivo), including exploration of tissue penetration and targeting of SLK in disease models. We expect these studies to provide a more complete picture of IL-17A and

PART I

IL17-F regulation. We expect this work to more clearly differentiate SLK, a Nanobody, from monoclonal antibody-based treatment options, including other IL-17 A and F inhibitors.
•Building our manufacturing capabilities — We intend to continue investing in our manufacturing capabilities. We believe these investments will provide sufficient supply for our clinical trials and eventually scale up production to meet commercial requirements. Anticipated continual improvements in manufacturing capabilities will be important in driving efficiency, maintaining high standards of quality control, and ensuring that investigators, physicians, and patients have adequate access to our product candidates at all points during studies and if approved. Technology transfers for drug substance and drug product to commercial scale contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) were executed in 2022. We believe this will allow scale-up of SLK and prepare us well in advance of potential Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial requirements.
•Deepening our intellectual property portfolio to support our Nanobody technology and product candidates — We intend to continue extending our global intellectual property portfolio consisting of patents and patent applications, trade secrets, trademarks, and know-how to protect SLK and its applications.
•Licensing/broadening our portfolio — To further enhance our overall potential and provide increased optionality, we may in-license or acquire other product candidates, in addition to SLK, for clinical development. We believe that our management team is well-positioned to identify assets that have attractive risk/reward profiles and that can be rapidly advanced to market approval, supplemented by our expertise and capabilities.
Our Focus: Inflammatory Diseases Involving IL-17A and IL-17F
SLK is an inhibitor of IL-17A and IL-17F that modulates cytokine activity in a fashion that is founded in current understanding of the importance of IL-17 biology in inflammatory disease. IL-17 cytokines produced by T cells and other cell types can potently promote inflammation and also play a role in protection against some infectious agents. The inflammatory effects of IL-17 can be targeted directly by blocking the cytokine or its receptor, or indirectly by blocking cytokines upstream of IL-17-producing cells. Members of this cytokine group have been shown to play an important role in chronic inflammation that occurs during the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases and allergies. IL-17 contributes to various lesions that are produced by Th17 cells, one subset of helper T cells, by gamma delta (γδ) T cells, and by innate lymphoid cells. In healthy skin, IL-17A is largely absent, but is significantly upregulated in psoriatic lesions. IL-17F is present in healthy skin at detectably higher concentrations than IL-17A, but is also upregulated in PsO. The current view is that IL-17F contributes to inflammatory conditions such as PsO, which is why IL-17A and F inhibition could well exert an increased anti-inflammatory therapeutic potential compared to just IL-17A inhibition, but could also well play a more important role than IL-17A in the physiological defense of a narrow spectrum of infections, particularly those caused by Candida species.
Millions of people worldwide suffer from diseases in which overexpression of IL-17A and IL17-F are potentially implicated in the pathophysiology and we believe there are limited treatment options that provide meaningful clinical improvement. Well-known diseases include HS, PsA, PsO, and axial spondyloarthritis ("axSpA") among others. HS has an estimated worldwide prevalence of up to 1-2%, though we believe it is currently underdiagnosed and undertreated with limited effective treatment options available. PsA has an estimated worldwide prevalence of up to 0.5%. Furthermore, up to 40% of patients with PsA have axial disease. These diseases exhibit notable overlap with approximately 30% of PsO patients exhibiting PsA and up to 40% of PsA patients exhibiting axSpA. In the United States alone, HS, PsA, and axSpA together affect between 2.0 and 2.5 million diagnosed patients. Finally, PsO has an estimated worldwide prevalence of approximately 2.5% and affects an estimated 1.7 million diagnosed patients in the United States alone. Other diseases, where IL17-A and IL17-F play a role, will represent additional pools of diagnosed patients.

Clinical Development of SLK
Phase 1 Clinical Trials
Previous Phase 1 single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) trials conducted by MHKDG included 48 and 40 patients respectively. Both trials were double-blind and placebo-controlled.
The SAD trial was a single-center, first-in-human trial, in healthy individuals treated with six ascending, subcutaneous regimens of SLK (Cohort 1 (starting dose): 3 mg (1x 0.25 mL); Cohort 2: 12 mg (1x 0.2 mL); Cohort 3: 60 mg (1x 1.0 mL); Cohort 4: 120 mg (2x 1.0 mL); Cohort 5: 240 mg (4x 1.0 mL); Cohort 6: 360 mg (4x 1.5 mL)). The primary objective was to test safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK). Regarding safety, there were no dose-related adverse events (AEs) or withdrawal AEs. Regarding tolerability, there were no patients with injection site findings of moderate or severe intensity; positive findings were sporadic, low frequency, mild and transient and of little or no clinical significance. Regarding immunogenicity, the trial showed low frequency of anti-drug antibodies. Regarding PK, the trial showed dose-proportional PK, including the area under the curve and maximum concentration. Other secondary and exploratory objectives were also met.
The MAD trial was a multiple-center, randomized trial in patients with moderate to severe PsO treated with subcutaneous injections, with SLK (30, 60, 120, or 240 mg) or placebo biweekly for six weeks, in four ascending dose cohorts, over a total period of 15 weeks, in 2014 and 2015. The primary objective was to test safety, tolerability, PK and immunogenicity of multiple subcutaneous doses of SLK versus placebo. The secondary objective was to study the pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles and efficacy of SLK. The overall timeline was 12 weeks, and the overall results are published in a peer-reviewed publication and available through NCT02156466. In summary, the trial demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability. Overall, these Phase 1 studies led to the decision to advance the program and the selection of 120mg/ml dosing used in the Phase 2 trial.
Phase 2b Clinical Trial in Psoriasis
In May 2021, data for the Phase 2b study of SLK in PsO was published. This study was conducted by Avillion under a 2017 co-development agreement with MHKDG. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study was designed to assess efficacy, safety and tolerability of SLK in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type PsO, over a total period of 52 weeks (inclusive of a 40-week follow-up assessment). In all cases, patients were administered SLK via subcutaneous injection.
The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy of four dose regimens of SLK compared to placebo on achievement of an Investigator’s Global Assessment (“IGA”) score of 0 or 1 after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type PsO. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of four dose regimens of SLK compared to placebo during a 12-week treatment period on secondary endpoints: PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100, change in mean PASI and shift in IGA, to assess the dose-regimen efficacy relationship for SLK after 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks of treatment, to evaluate the longer-term efficacy of SLK at Week 24 and at Weeks 36 and 48, and to assess the safety and tolerability of SLK. Other exploratory objectives were also considered.

PART I

Primary and secondary end-points, associated with the described objectives were achieved. Doses up to 120 mg showed rapid and significant differences in PASI 100 compared with placebo (Figure 2). In the highest dosage group, nearly six out of ten patients (57%) achieved total skin clearance (PASI 100 response) after 24 weeks. Rapid response was demonstrated with one of three patients already achieving nearly clear skin (PASI 90 response) by week four. Analysis of an individualized dosing scheme including off-drug periods in controlled patients revealed durable responses over one year. SLK was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to the active control, secukinumab, and an overall Candida infection rate of 2.9% from week 0 to week 12 and 6.4% in the period from week 12 to week 52 across all doses. The clinical data for SLK in this Phase 2b study is summarized in Figure 2, showing PASI 100 responses for several doses and schedules, and Figure 3, showing safety and tolerability data for the same doses and schedules.
Figure 2 — Summary of PASI 100 response in Phase 2b patients up to 24 weeks (Papp K, et al. EADV 2020, Late-breaking presentation D1T03)
This clinical trial significantly expands the number of patients and duration of therapy evaluated for SLK in plaque PsO and represents the first Phase 2 evaluation of a Nanobody IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor in PsO. The study found that SLK generated an active response in the treatment of plaque PsO. The safety profile reflects the mechanism of action with oral Candida as the most reported adverse event, in the same range as IL-17A inhibitors (7.4%) and lower than the other IL-17A and IL17-F molecule in clinical development. Additional assessment and modelling could further refine selection of dosages in future clinical studies.
Ongoing Clinical Development
SLK is the first Nanobody to show responses in a Phase 2b study of PsO, a disease where IL-17 biology is central to pathology. SLK was well tolerated and showed responses, as measured by PASI 90 and PASI 100. This supports our ongoing efforts to develop SLK in PsO and other inflammatory diseases driven by IL-17A and IL-17F, including HS and PsA.

insight and robustness of data. We will continue using the reference 120mg SLK dosing but will consider dosing up to 240mg to define best treatment options in these deep-tissue diseases. Like the Phase 2 program for PsO, we are using an induction period (typically 2-week dosing) before stabilizing maintenance dosing (typically q4w). We expect to have primary-end point readouts at 12 weeks across the MIRA trial and the ARGO trial. Primary endpoints are ACR50 (for ARGO in PsA) and HiSCR75 (for MIRA in HS). As part of the secondary endpoint sets, we intend to measure different score levels for selected primary instruments, as well as alternative scores, indices and instruments plus quality-of-life measurements to build more complete clinical profiles. Customary sampling, anti-drug antibodies measurements and other analyses, as well as functional indexes as applicable, will also be part of the clinical operations. The MIRA trial has completed enrollment in February 2023 and we expect a readout of the primary endpoint in mid-2023. For the ARGO trial, recruitment is on-going, with the first sites having been initiated in the United States and Europe in late 2022. Our clinical studies are performed with the support of a global contract research organization ("CRO").
About the MIRA trial
The MIRA trial (M1095-HS-201) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SLK, administered subcutaneously, in the treatment of adult patients with active moderate to severe HS. The trial is comprised of over 200 patients, and is designed to evaluate two different doses of SLK, with placebo control and adalimumab as an active control reference arm. The primary endpoint of the trial is the percentage of participants achieving HiSCR75, defined as a greater than or equal to 75% reduction in total abscess and inflammatory nodule count with no increase in abscess count or draining tunnel count relative to baseline. The trial is also designed to evaluate a number of secondary endpoints, including the proportion of patients achieving HiSCR50, the change from baseline in International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System, the proportion of patients achieving a Dermatology Life Quality Index total score of less than or equal to 5, and the proportion of patients achieving at least 30% reduction from baseline in Numerical Rating Scale in the Patient’s Global Assessment of Skin Pain.
About the ARGO trial
The ARGO trial (M1095-PSA-201) is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SLK, administered subcutaneously, in the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. The study will be comprised of approximately 200 patients, and will evaluate different doses of SLK, with placebo control and adalimumab as an active reference arm. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of participants achieving greater than or equal to 50% improvement in signs and symptoms of disease from baseline, compared to placebo, as measured by the ACR50 response. The study will also evaluate a number of secondary endpoints, including improvement compared to placebo in ACR70, complete skin clearance as measured by a 100% improvement in PASI, physical function as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, enthesitis as measured by the Leeds Enthesitis Index and pain as measured by the Patients Assessment of Arthritis Pain.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities and currently have no plans to establish any. We partner with third-party CMOs for both drug substance and finished drug product, through established contracts.
Our current drug substance supplier is Richter-Helm Biologics GmbH & Co. KG (“RHB”) based in Bovenau, Germany. Effective July 1, 2021, we entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with RHB with respect to the manufacture of SLK. We may terminate the contract manufacturing agreement for convenience in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Either party may also terminate the contract manufacturing agreement with respect to an uncured breach by the other party in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The agreement includes confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.
MHKDG produced the drug product supply for our Phase 2 clinical trials, the MIRA trial and the ARGO trial. In 2022, we successfully transferred the drug product process to Vetter Pharma International GmbH as part of our strategy to ensure sufficient supply for potential commercialization following all regulatory and related requirements.

The Merck Healthcare KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany) License Agreement
On April 29, 2021, we entered into a license agreement with MHKDG (the “License Agreement”). The License Agreement is a sublicense of a license agreement between MHKDG and Ablynx, dated September 3, 2008 (the “Initial License Agreement”), pursuant to which MHKDG developed SLK, and subsequently acquired exclusive right and title to SLK, including the right to further develop and commercialize (and grant sublicenses to further develop and commercialize) SLK. Pursuant to the License Agreement, we acquired (i) a royalty- and milestone-bearing exclusive (even as to MHKDG), sublicensable right and license under MHKDG’s controlled patents, materials, and exclusive know-how to develop, manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, export and import and otherwise commercialize SLK on a world-wide basis, (ii) a royalty- and milestone-bearing non-exclusive, sublicensable, right and sublicense under Ablynx’s and certain others’ controlled patents, materials, and know-how to develop, manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, export and import and otherwise commercialize SLK on a world-wide basis, in each case subject to certain restrictions and compliance with the terms and conditions of the Initial License Agreement; and (iii) a royalty- and milestone-bearing non-exclusive, sublicensable right and sublicense under Research Cooperation Technologies (“RCT”) patents and know-how related to the manufacturing process using the underlying yeast strain Pichia pastoris, to develop, manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale, export and import and otherwise commercialize SLK on a world-wide basis, in each case subject to certain restrictions and compliance with the terms and conditions of the underlying license granted to MHKDG from RCT. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we have the first right to file, prosecute and maintain the licensed patents as well as the first right to attempt to resolve any third party infringement.
The License Agreement includes a development plan, subject to specified periodic updates, which describes the plan for developing the licensed products in the initial target indications of HS and PsA, including the plan for conducting clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval in the major European markets, Japan, and the United States (the “Major Markets”). In accordance with the foregoing, we, among other requirements, are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop one licensed product in at least two indications, including initiating certain Phase 2 trials for the licensed product within a specified period following conclusion of the License Agreement, and launching and commercializing the same in each of the Major Markets a certain period following receipt of regulatory approval in such respective markets. At our request, and in accordance with a manufacturing quality agreement subsequently entered into by the parties, MHKDG has agreed to manufacture and supply certain drug product to us for clinical trial supply, subject to certain conditions (including a cap on such supply).
The aggregate purchase price in respect of the License Agreement was $29.9 million and consisted of an upfront cash payment by us to MHKDG and an issuance of equity by us to MHKDG, representing a 9.9% ownership stake in our subsidiary, MoonLake Immunotherapeutics AG, a Swiss stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) registered with the commercial register of the Canton of Zug, Switzerland under the number CHE-433.093.536 (“MoonLake AG”), following such issuance. Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, milestone cash payments of up to EUR 307.1 million ($327.5 million using a December 31, 2022 exchange rate) are potentially payable, of which $8.0 million has been recognized as R&D expense in 2022. Future milestones will become payable upon regulatory filing acceptances in the US, in the European Union (“EU”) and Japan, first commercial sales in these geographies, and meeting certain annual thresholds in global net sales. In addition, the License Agreement requires us to pay royalties within the range of low to mid-teen percent of net sales. Our obligation to pay royalties are on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis and continue from

the date of first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country until the later of (i) ten years from such first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country or (ii) the expiration or invalidation of the last remaining valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product.
Unless sooner terminated, the term of the License Agreement continues until the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the License Agreement due to a material breach by the other party (subject to a cure period). We may terminate the License Agreement (i) at our convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice to MHKDG following receipt by MHKDG of the required upfront payment or (ii) upon 90 days’ prior written notice to MHKDG if we have reasonable belief that the medical risk/benefit of SLK is unfavorable in light of the welfare of patients and not suitable for further development or commercialization. Obligations accrued prior to termination, such as milestone payments, will persist.
Concurrently with the License Agreement, on April 29, 2021, we also executed a Side Letter to the License Agreement with MHKDG, which provides that upon the termination of the Initial License Agreement, under the terms of the Initial License Agreement, for any reason, the License Agreement will be automatically assigned to Ablynx. Upon assignment to Ablynx, any intellectual property licensed to us by MHKDG, and the obligations and liability associated therewith, under the License Agreement, shall continue, provided that the continuing obligations and liability of MHKDG under the License Agreement shall be limited to only that intellectual property owned or held by MHKDG following termination of the Initial License Agreement.
Government Regulation
The FDA, and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.
U.S. Biologics Regulation
In the United States, biological products are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), and the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), and other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequence compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative action and judicial sanctions. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
•approval by an independent IRB or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
•manufacture of the proposed biologic candidate in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMPs”);
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
•preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and 
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS

PART I

controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of a BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
Preclinical and Clinical Development
Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol or protocols for preclinical studies and clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
In addition to the IND submission process, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee (“IBC”), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries.
For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.
•Phase 1. The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
•Phase 2. The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3. The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
PART I

In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
BLA Submission and Review
Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated and sponsored by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial pediatric study plan within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after for the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete 
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
PART I

Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. The fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

PART I

In 2017, the FDA established a new regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”), designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”). The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug that meets the following criteria: (i) the drug qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. RMAT designation provides all the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation, including more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the development plan for the product candidate and eligibility for rolling review and priority review. Products granted RMAT designation may also be eligible for accelerated approval on the basis of a surrogate or intermediate endpoint reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites, including through expansion to additional sites. Once approved, when appropriate, the FDA can permit fulfillment of post-approval requirements under accelerated approval through: the submission of clinical evidence, preclinical studies, clinical trials, patient registries or other sources of real world evidence such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory datasets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with the therapy prior to approval.
Breakthrough Designation
A product intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product, including involvement of senior managers.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee.
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
PART I

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which the FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products;
•consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
•mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
•the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
Regulation of Diagnostic Tests
Our drug candidates may require use of a diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations for our product candidates. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are medical devices, often in vitro devices, which provide 
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
PART I

information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug. In the United States, the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval (“PMA”). We expect that any companion diagnostic developed for our drug candidates will utilize the PMA pathway.
PMA applications must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, preclinical, clinical and manufacturing data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. For diagnostic tests, a PMA application typically includes data regarding analytical and clinical validation studies. As part of its review of the PMA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. FDA review of an initial PMA may require several years to complete. If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA. If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel drugs such as our drug candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by the FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) regulations. Thus, the sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE.
Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
The Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are highly similar, or “biosimilar,” to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, is generally shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. A product shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product may rely in part on the FDA’s previous determination of safety and effectiveness for the reference product for approval, which can potentially reduce the cost and time required to obtain approval to market the 
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
PART I

product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being worked out by the FDA.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and similar foreign, federal and state fraud, abuse and transparency laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including stock options. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand, and prescribers and purchasers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but they are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration, such as consulting agreements, that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
Civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which can be enforced through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, the government may assert that a claim resulting from 
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
PART I

a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the healthcare fraud statute implemented under HIPAA or specific intent to violate the statute in order to have committed a violation.
The FDCA addresses, among other things, the design, production, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and testing of drugs, biologics and medical devices, and prohibits such acts as the introduction into interstate commerce of adulterated or misbranded drugs or devices. The PHSA also prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of unlicensed or mislabeled biological products.
The U.S. federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) information related to payments or other transfers of value made to various healthcare professionals including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), enacted August 16, 2022, aims to control prescription drug prices in the upcoming years. The IRA will allow the CMS to cap out-of-pocket costs in 2025 and to negotiate prescription drug prices in 2026 for the first time. Additionally, the IRA provides a new “inflation rebate” covering Medicare patients to take effect in 2023 to prevent rapid and arbitrary price increases in prescription drugs. 
We are also subject to additional similar U.S. state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which, in some cases, differ from each other in significant ways, and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Data Privacy & Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. Additionally, our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may be subject to laws and evolving regulations regarding the use of artificial intelligence/machine learning, controlling for data bias, and antidiscrimination.

With regard to the transfer of data from the EU to the UK, the TCA (as defined below) provided for a transition period of up to six months as of January 1, 2021 to enable the European Commission (the “EC”) to complete its adequacy assessment of the UK’s data protection laws. On June 28, 2021, the EC adopted two adequacy decisions for the United Kingdom (the “UK”) – one under the GDPR and the other for the Law Enforcement Directive (2016/680). Personal data may now freely flow from the EU to the UK since the UK is deemed to have an adequate data protection level. Additionally, following Brexit, companies also have to comply with the UK’s data protection laws (including the UK GDPR, which is based on the EU GDPR), the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The adequacy decisions include a “sunset clause” which entails that the decisions will automatically expire four years after their entry into force.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product, if approved, depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement, if any, for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of our product candidates, if approved, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations.
As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
The ACA, which was enacted in March 2010, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular import to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those 
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS

PART I

governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, the Tax Act was enacted, which, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with ACA’s requirement to carry health insurance, known as the “individual mandate,” effective January 1, 2019. Since the enactment of the Tax Act, there have been additional amendments to certain provisions of the ACA.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including automatic aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year as part of the federal budget sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, unless additional action is taken by Congress.
Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state measures designed to, among other things, reduce the cost of prescription drugs, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in May 2019, CMS adopted a final rule allowing Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs, permitting Medicare Part D plans to apply certain utilization controls to new starts of five of the six protected class drugs, and requiring the Explanation of Benefits for Part D beneficiaries to disclose drug price increases and lower cost therapeutic alternatives beginning January 1, 2021. In addition, in August 2022, Congress passed the IRA, which for the first time authorized CMS to negotiate Medicare reimbursement rates for certain prescription drug products, which may put limits on prices paid for drugs by government health programs.
Congress and the Biden administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Other Government Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, quality control, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, export and import, advertising, marketing and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization, approval as well as post-approval monitoring and reporting of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements to conduct additional clinical trials, product licensing, safety reporting, post-authorization requirements, marketing and promotion, interactions with healthcare professionals, pricing and reimbursement may vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate approval application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices may not be approved for such product, which would make launch of such products commercially unfeasible in such countries.

Regulation in the European Union
Drug and Biologic Development Process
Clinical trials are studies intended to discover or verify the effects of one or more investigational medicines. The regulation of clinical trials aims to ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected and the results of clinical trials are credible. Regardless of where they are conducted, all clinical trials included in applications for marketing authorization for human medicines in the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (the “European Economic Area” or “EEA”) must have been carried out in accordance with EU regulations. This means that clinical trials conducted in the EEA have to comply with EU clinical trial legislation but also that clinical trials conducted outside the EEA have to comply with ethical principles equivalent to those set out in the EEA, including adhering to international GCP and the Declaration of Helsinki.
The conduct of clinical trials in the EU is governed by the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 (the “Clinical Trials Regulation” or “CTR”), which entered into force on January 31, 2022. The CTR replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, (Clinical Trials Directive) and introduced a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. 
Under the former regime, which will expire after a transition period of one or three years, respectively, as outlined below in more detail, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each EU Member State where there is a site at which the clinical trial is to be conducted. The approval must be obtained from two separate entities: the National Competent Authority (the “NCA”), and one or more Ethics Committees. The NCA of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial will be conducted must authorize the conduct of the trial, and the independent Ethics Committee must grant a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the clinical trial in the relevant EU Member State before the commencement of the trial. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the clinical trial applications must be submitted to or approved by the relevant NCA and Ethics Committees. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial must be reported to the NCA and to the Ethics Committees of the EU Member State where they occur.
A more unified procedure will apply under the new Clinical Trials Regulation. A sponsor will be able to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials portal. One national regulatory authority (the reporting EU Member State proposed by the applicant) will take the lead in validating and evaluating the application and will consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval and prevent the clinical trial from being conducted in such Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting, and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. Member states will work in the Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”) immediately after the system has gone live. Until January 31, 2023, clinical trial sponsors can still choose whether to apply to run a clinical trial under the former system, the Clinical Trials Directive, or to use CTIS to apply to run a clinical trial under the CTR. On January 31, 2023, submission of initial clinical trial applications via CTIS became mandatory, and by January 31, 2025, all ongoing trials approved under the former Clinical Trials Directive will need to comply with the CTR and have to be transitioned to CTIS.
Under both the former regime and the new Clinical Trials Regulation, national laws, regulations, and the applicable GCP and GLP standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH, guidelines on BCP and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
During the development of a medicinal product, the European Medical Agency (“EMA”) and national regulators within the EU provide the opportunity for dialogue and guidance on the development program. At the EMA level, this is usually done in the form of scientific advice, which is given by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”), on the recommendation of the Scientific Advice Working Party, or SAWP. A fee is incurred with each scientific advice procedure, 
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
PART I

but is significantly reduced for designated orphan medicines. Advice from the EMA is typically provided based on questions concerning, for example, quality (chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing), nonclinical testing and clinical studies, and pharmacovigilance plans and risk-management programs and is not legally binding with regard to any future Marketing Authorization Application, (“MA Application”), of the product concerned.
Drug Marketing Authorization
In the EEA, after completion of all required clinical testing, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). To obtain an MA of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant can submit an MA Application through, amongst others, a centralized or decentralized procedure.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA that is issued by the EC following the scientific assessment of the application by the EMA, that is valid for all EU Member States as well as in the three additional EEA Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific medicinal products, including for medicines developed by means of certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMP, and medicinal products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases (AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases). For medicinal products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA before May 20, 2004 and indicated for the treatment of other diseases, medicinal products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations or for which the grant of a MA through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health at EU level, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for a marketing authorization through the centralized procedure.
Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP, established at the EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure, the timeframe for the evaluation of an MA Application by the EMA’s CHMP is, in principle, 210 days from receipt of a valid MA Application. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more, unless the application is eligible for an accelerated assessment. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. Upon request, the CHMP can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment. The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements. This opinion is then transmitted to the EC, which has the ultimate authority for granting MA within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion.
Medicines that fall outside the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure have three routes to authorization: (i) they can be authorized under the centralized procedure if they concern a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if their authorization would be in the interest of public health; (ii) they can be authorized under a decentralized procedure where an applicant applies for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU member state; or (iii) they can be authorized in an EU member state in accordance with that state’s national procedures and then be authorized in other EU countries by a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization (mutual recognition procedure). 
The decentralized procedure permits companies to file identical MA applications for a medicinal product to the competent authorities in various EU Member States simultaneously if such medicinal product has not received marketing approval in any EU Member State before. This procedure is available for pharmaceutical products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference EU Member State and concerned EU Member States. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Subsequently each concerned EU Member State must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If an EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of

PART I

potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding for all EU Member States.
All new marketing authorization applications must include a Risk Management Plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. RMPs are continually modified and updated throughout the lifetime of the medicine as new information becomes available. We need to submit an updated RMP: (i) at the request of EMA or a national competent authority, or (ii) whenever the risk-management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit-risk profile or as a result of an important pharmacovigilance or risk-minimization milestone being reached. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. RMPs and Periodic Safety Update Reports (“PSURs”), are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.
Marketing Authorizations have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may subsequently be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with only one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
Special rules apply in part for ATMPs. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products, which are genes, cells or tissues that have undergone substantial manipulation and that are administered to human beings in order to cure, diagnose or prevent diseases or regenerate, repair or replace a human tissue. Pursuant to the ATMP Regulation, the Committee on Advanced Therapies (“CAT”) is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs. The manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MA Application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although such guidelines are not legally binding, compliance with them is often necessary to gain and maintain approval for product candidates.
In addition to the mandatory RMP, the holder of a marketing authorization for an ATMP must put in place and maintain a system to ensure that each individual product and its starting and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the cells or tissues it may contain, can be traced through the sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, transport and delivery to the relevant healthcare institution where the product is used.
Data and Market Exclusivity
As in the United States, it may be possible to obtain a period of market and / or data exclusivity in the EU that would have the effect of postponing the entry into the marketplace of a competitor’s generic, hybrid or biosimilar product (even if the pharmaceutical product has already received a MA) and prohibiting another applicant from relying on the MA holder’s pharmacological, toxicological and clinical data in support of another MA for the purposes of submitting an application, obtaining MA or placing the product on the market. New Chemical Entities (“NCEs”) approved in the EU qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of marketing exclusivity.
An additional non-cumulative one-year period of marketing exclusivity is possible if during the data exclusivity period (the first eight years of the 10-year marketing exclusivity period), the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that are deemed to bring a significant clinical benefit compared to existing therapies.
The data exclusivity period begins on the date of the product’s first MA in the EU. After eight years, a generic product application may be submitted and generic companies may rely on the MA holder’s data. However, a generic product cannot launch until two years later (or a total of 10 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovator product), or three years later (or a total of 11 years after the first MA in the EU of the innovator product) if the MA holder obtains MA for a new indication with significant clinical benefit within the eight-year data exclusivity period. Additionally, another noncumulative one-year period of data exclusivity can be added to the eight years of data exclusivity where an application is made for a new 
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2022
PART I

indication for a well-established substance, provided that significant pre-clinical or clinical studies were carried out in relation to the new indication. Another year of data exclusivity may be added to the eight years, where a change of classification of a pharmaceutical product has been authorized on the basis of significant pre-trial tests or clinical trials (when examining an application by another applicant for or holder of market authorization for a change of classification of the same substance the competent authority will not refer to the results of those tests or trials for one year after the initial chance was authorized).
Products may not be granted data exclusivity since there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the European Union’s regulatory authorities to include an NCE. Even if a compound is considered to be an NCE and the MA applicant is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the medicinal product if such company can complete a full marketing authorization application with their own complete database of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtain MA of its product.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union are similar in principle to those in the United States. The EMA grants orphan drug designation if the medicinal product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union (prevalence criterion). In addition, Orphan Drug Designation can be granted if, for economic reasons, the medicinal product would be unlikely to be developed without incentives and if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the European Union of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed medicinal product is a significant benefit to patients affected by the condition. An application for orphan drug designation (which is not a marketing authorization, as not all orphan-designated medicines reach the authorization application stage) must be submitted first before an application for marketing authorization of the medicinal product is submitted. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted, and sponsors must submit an annual report to EMA summarizing the status of development of the medicine. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. Designated orphan medicines are eligible for conditional marketing authorization.
The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products reassesses the orphan drug designation of a product in parallel with the review for a marketing authorization; for a product to benefit from market exclusivity it must maintain its orphan drug designation at the time of marketing authorization review by the EMA and approval by the EC. Additionally, any marketing authorization granted for an orphan medicinal product must only cover the therapeutic indication(s) that are covered by the orphan drug designation. Upon the grant of a marketing authorization, orphan drug designation provides up to ten years of market exclusivity in the orphan indication.
During the 10-year period of market exclusivity, with a limited number of exceptions, the regulatory authorities of the EU Member States and the EMA may not accept applications for marketing authorization, accept an application to extend an existing marketing authorization or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products for the same therapeutic indication. A similar medicinal product is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity for an orphan-designated condition when the results of specific studies are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”) addressing the pediatric population and completed in accordance with a fully compliant Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”). No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The 10-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation (i.e. the condition prevalence or financial returns criteria under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products). When the period of orphan market exclusivity for an indication ends, the orphan drug designation for that indication expires as well. Orphan exclusivity runs in parallel with normal rules on data exclusivity and market protection. Additionally, a marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product (orphan or not) for the same or overlapping indication subject to certain requirements.

Pediatric Development
In the European Union, companies developing a new medicinal product are obligated to study their product in children and must therefore submit a PIP, together with a request for agreement to the EMA. The EMA issues a decision on the PIP based on an opinion of the EMA’s Pediatric Committee. Companies must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with the PIP approved by the EMA, unless a deferral (e.g. until enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults is available) or waiver (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults) has been granted by the EMA. The MA Application for the medicinal product must include the results of all pediatric clinical trials performed and details of all information collected in compliance with the approved PIP, unless a waiver or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials may be completed at a later date. Medicinal products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the approved PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate (if any is in effect at the time of approval) or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two year extension of the orphan market exclusivity. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the approved PIP are developed and submitted. An approved PIP is also required when a MA holder wants to add a new indication, medicinal form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized and covered by intellectual property rights.
PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines (“PRIME”), scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies on the basis of compelling non-clinical data and tolerability data from initial clinical trials. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and potentially accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, once a candidate medicine has been selected for the PRIME scheme, a dedicated contact point and rapporteur from the CHMP or from CAT are appointed facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting with the CHMP/CAT rapporteur initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts to provide guidance on the overall development plan and regulatory strategy. PRIME eligibility does not change the standards for product approval, and there is no assurance that any such designation or eligibility will result in expedited review or approval.
Post-Approval Regulation
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after grant of manufacturing licenses and marketing authorizations. It includes control of compliance with EU good manufacturing practices rules, manufacturing authorizations, pharmacovigilance rules and requirements governing advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, recordkeeping, importing and exporting of medicinal products.
Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers and distributors to comply with EU laws and the related national laws of individual EU Member States governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties.
These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant marketing authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the marketing authorization, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
MOONLAKE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS

The holder of a marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with EU pharmacovigilance legislation and its related regulations and guidelines, which entail many requirements for conducting pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products. These pharmacovigilance rules can impose on holders of MAs the obligation to conduct a labor intensive collection of data regarding the risks and benefits of marketed medicinal products and to engage in ongoing assessments of those risks and benefits, including the possible requirement to conduct additional clinical studies or post-authorization safety studies to obtain further information on a medicine’s safety, or to measure the effectiveness of risk-management measures, which may be time consuming and expensive and could impact our profitability. MA holders must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of PSURs, in relation to medicinal products for which they hold MAs. The EMA reviews PSURs for medicinal products authorized through the centralized procedure. If the EMA has concerns that the risk benefit profile of a product has varied, it can adopt an opinion advising that the existing MA for the product be suspended, withdrawn or varied. The agency can advise that the MA holder be obliged to conduct post-authorization Phase IV safety studies. If the EC agrees with the opinion, it can adopt a decision varying the existing MA. Failure by the marketing authorization holder to fulfill the obligations for which the EC’s decision provides can undermine the ongoing validity of the MA.
More generally, non-compliance with pharmacovigilance obligations can lead to the variation, suspension or withdrawal of the MA for the product or imposition of financial penalties or other enforcement measures.
The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products in the European Union is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they believe do not comply with regulations. Manufacturing requires a manufacturing authorization, and the manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for GMP. These requirements include compliance with EU GMP standards when manufacturing pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the European Union with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the European Union. Similarly, the distribution of pharmaceutical products into and within the European Union is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. The manufacturer or importer must have a qualified person who is responsible for certifying that each batch of product has been manufactured in accordance with GMP, before releasing the product for commercial distribution in the European Union or for use in a clinical trial. Manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the competent authorities for compliance with GMP.
Sales and Marketing Regulations
The advertising and promotion of our products is also subject to EU laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. In addition, other national legislation of individual EU Member States may apply to the advertising and promotion of medicinal products and may differ from one country to another. These laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s SmPC, as approved by the competent regulatory authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product. It forms an intrinsic and integral part of the marketing authorization granted for the medicinal product. Promotion of a medicinal product that does not comply with the SmPC is considered to constitute off-label promotion. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Violations of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the European Union could be penalized by administrative measures, fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may also impose limitations on its promotional activities with healthcare professionals.

PART I

In the EU, interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians are also governed by strict laws, regulations, industry self-regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct both at EU level and in the individual EU Member States. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States. Violation of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States also must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her regulatory professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Other Markets
Since the UK has formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 and the transition period, during which EU laws continued to apply to the UK, expired on December 31, 2020, EU laws now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. The European Union and the United Kingdom have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (“TCA”), which was ratified by the UK Parliament on December 30, 2020. The TCA was applied provisionally as of January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021.
The TCA includes provisions affecting the life sciences sector (including on customs and tariffs) but areas for further discussion between the European Union and the United Kingdom remain. In addition, there are some specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals. These include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued. The TCA does not, however, contain wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations and product standards.
Since January 1, 2021, the EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law.” As there is no general power to amend these regulations, the UK government has adopted the Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021 (“MMDA”) which seeks to address this regulatory gap through introducing regulation-making, delegated powers covering the fields of human medicines, clinical trials of human medicines, veterinary medicines and medical devices. The purpose of the MMDA is to enable the existing regulatory frameworks to be updated, with the powers granted under it only exercisable in relation to four pieces of legislation: the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, the Medicines (Products for Human Use) Regulations 2016 and limited parts of the Medicines Act 1968 (specifically those parts which make provision related to pharmacies). It is then further restricted to amending or updating only those provisions stated in the act, which include clinical trials.
Specified provisions of the MMDA entered into force on February 11, 2021 when the legislation formally became law. The remaining provisions came into effect within two months of February 11, 2021 or will come into effect otherwise as stipulated in subsequent statutory instruments. The MMDA supplements the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (the “Regulations”), which are based on the EU Medical Devices Directive as amended to reflect the United Kingdom’s post-Brexit regulatory regime. Notably, the Regulations do not include any of the revisions that have been made by the EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745, which has gained full application in all EU Member States since May 26, 2021 but is not applicable in the UK as “retained law”. Additionally, the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) launched a comprehensive consultation on September 16, 2021 with proposals to amend the regulatory framework for medical devices in the United Kingdom. The stated objectives of the proposals include expansion of the scope of the Regulations (for example, by expanding the in vitro diagnostic medical device definition to include software and other products, including products without an intended medical purpose but with similar functioning and risk profiles) and potentially through use of internationally recognized definitions (for example, by excluding products that contain viable biological substances and excluding food), remove trade barriers, further the availability of medical devices and improve the favorability of the UK market. The consultation period closed on November 25, 2021 and on June 26, 2022, the MHRA published a response to its consultation, which sets out the proposed new UK regulatory framework for

medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The proposals are intended to improve patient safety and public health through appropriate regulatory oversight, improve the traceability of medical devices, improve the regulation of the rules governing software and AI as medical devices and introduce alternative routes to market to ensure the UK aligns with any superior international best practices. The new framework is expected to apply from July 1, 2023 with appropriate transitional measures and the introduction of secondary legislation. It is envisaged that in Northern Ireland the amended regime could run in parallel with any existing or future EU rules in accordance with the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.

For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In addition, the possibility of a second Scottish referendum on the independence of Scotland from the UK and the uncertainty associated with such a referendum (as well as any potential outcomes were a referendum to be held) could result in additional economic uncertainty and cause disruption to economic trade and our business operations.
