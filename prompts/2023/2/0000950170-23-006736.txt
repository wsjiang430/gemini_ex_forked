Company Overview
 Red Violet, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “red violet,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is dedicated to making the world a safer place and reducing the cost of doing business. We build proprietary technologies and apply analytical capabilities to deliver identity intelligence. Our technology powers critical solutions, which empower organizations to operate with confidence. Our solutions enable the real-time identification and location of people, businesses, assets and their interrelationships. These solutions are used for purposes including risk mitigation, due diligence, fraud detection and prevention, regulatory compliance, and customer acquisition. Our intelligent platform, CORETM, is purpose-built for the enterprise, yet flexible enough for organizations of all sizes, bringing clarity to massive datasets by transforming data into intelligence. We drive workflow efficiency and enable organizations to make better data-driven decisions.
 Organizations are challenged by the structure, volume and disparity of data. Our platform and applications transform the way our customers interact with information, presenting connections and relevance of information otherwise unattainable, which drives actionable insights and better outcomes. Leveraging cloud-native proprietary technology and applying machine learning and advanced analytical capabilities, CORE provides essential solutions to public and private sector organizations through intuitive, easy-to-use analytical interfaces. With massive data assets consisting of public record, proprietary and publicly-available data, our differentiated information and innovative platform and solutions deliver identity intelligence – entities, relationships, affiliations, interactions, and events. Our solutions are used today to enable frictionless commerce, to ensure safety, and to reduce fraud and the concomitant expense borne by society.
 While our platform powers many diverse solutions for our customers, we presently market our solutions primarily through two brands, IDI and FOREWARN®. IDI is a leading-edge, analytics and information solutions provider delivering actionable intelligence to the risk management industry in support of use cases such as the verification and authentication of consumer identities, due diligence, prevention of fraud and abuse, legislative compliance, and debt recovery. idiCORE is IDI's flagship product. idiCORE is a next-generation, investigative solution used to address a variety of organizational challenges including due diligence, risk mitigation, identity authentication and regulatory compliance, by financial services companies, insurance companies, healthcare companies, law enforcement and government, collections, law firms, retail, telecommunication companies, corporate security and investigative firms. FOREWARN is an app-based solution currently tailored for the real estate industry, providing instant knowledge prior to face-to-face engagement with a consumer, helping professionals identify and mitigate risk. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, IDI had 7,021 and 6,548 billable customers and FOREWARN had 116,960 and 82,419 users, respectively. We define a billable customer of IDI as a single entity that generated revenue during the last three months of the period. Billable customers are typically corporate organizations. In most cases, corporate organizations will have multiple users and/or departments purchasing our solutions, however, the Company counts the entire organization as a discrete customer. We define a user of FOREWARN as a unique person that has a subscription to use the FOREWARN service as of the last day of the period. A unique person can only have one user account.
 We generate substantially all of our revenue from licensing our solutions. Customers access our solutions through a hosted environment using an online interface, batch processing, API and custom integrations. We recognize revenue from licensing fees (a) on a transactional basis determined by the customer’s usage, (b) via a monthly fee or (c) from a combination of both. Revenue pursuant to pricing contracts containing a monthly fee is recognized ratably over the contract period. Pricing contracts are generally annual contracts or longer, with auto renewal. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 75% and 80% of total revenue was attributable to customers with pricing contracts, respectively, versus 25% and 20% attributable to transactional customers, respectively.




We endeavor to understand our customers’ needs at the moment of first engagement. We continuously engage with our customers and evaluate their usage of our solutions throughout their life cycle, to maximize utilization of our solutions and, hence, their productivity. Our go-to-market strategy leverages (a) an inside sales team that cultivates relationships, and ultimately closes business, with their end-user markets, (b) a strategic sales team that provides a more personal, face-to-face approach for major accounts within certain industries, and (c) distributors, resellers, and strategic partners that have a significant foothold in many of the industries that we have not historically served, as well as to further penetrate those industries that we do serve. We employ a “land and expand” approach. Our sales model generally begins with a free trial followed by an initial purchase on a transactional basis or minimum-committed monthly spend. As organizations derive benefits from our solutions, we are able to expand within organizations as additional use cases are presented across departments, divisions and geographic locations and customers become increasingly reliant on our solutions in their daily workflow.
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had revenue of $53.3 million and $44.0 million, net income of $0.6 million and $0.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $12.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“US GAAP”), excluding interest (income) expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, gain on extinguishment of debt, litigation costs, and write-off of long-lived assets and others, as noted in the tables included in “Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Our Markets
 The target market for our solutions today consists of public and private sector organizations where cloud-driven identity intelligence is primary to their daily workflow.
 The data and analytics sector continues to grow at an accelerated pace due to the proliferation of data generated over the past two decades from both traditional and emerging sources, including e-commerce, mobile and social media. International Data Corporation, a global provider of market intelligence and advisory services, estimates that worldwide revenue for data and business analytics services was $215.7 billion in the year 2021, and a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2021 through 2025 will be 12.8%. Fortune Business InsightsTM projected the global big data analytics market to rise to $655.5 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 13.4% during the forecast period from 2022 through 2029. Continued, rapid innovation and adoption of new technologies presents enormous challenges for organizations of all types to sort through this sea of data to glean actionable intelligence and address their mission-critical functions. These challenges serve as key drivers of the sector’s growth. Our industry-agnostic platform, solutions, and analytical capabilities are designed to solve the myriad of complex problems that organizations face on a daily basis.
 Risk and fraud analytics has become increasingly important not only in the banking and financial services sectors but across multiple other industries and use cases. According to the market research company MarketsAndMarkets, the risk analytics market is projected to grow to $70.5 billion by 2027, representing CAGR of 12.4% from 2022 through 2027, with North America expected to account for the largest market size in the risk analytics market. Risk and fraud analytics and the information derived therefrom is now the primary service product for risk management associated with key purchasers such as banking and financial services companies, insurance companies, healthcare companies, law enforcement and government, collection agencies, law firms, retail, telecommunications companies and investigative firms. Primary use cases include, but are not limited to, obtaining information on consumers, businesses and assets (and their interrelationships) to facilitate the location of individuals and assets, identity verification, legislative compliance and to support criminal, legal, financial, insurance, and corporate investigations, due diligence and the assessment and mitigation of counterparty risk.
 Key Challenges Facing Our Customers
 We believe our solutions address the challenges that the industry faces today, which include:
 Actionable Insights Through a Single, Cloud-Native Platform—As the velocity and volume of data continues to grow exponentially, organizations have become overwhelmed with data and their inability to glean actionable insights from such data to derive successful decisions in real-time. Customers demand full-suite, turn-key solutions that are agile, flexible, and available on-demand in order to gain the speed, scale and insight necessary to drive decisioning. As the breadth and depth of data increases, organizations will need to deploy new technologies that enable both the ingestion of data at massive scale in real-time, irrespective of structure or form, and the analytics applications necessary to function across multiple channels. The accelerating digitization of human interactions, and the corresponding generation of the data resulting therefrom, is driving demand for data capture, management and analysis software. As a result, customers are looking for flexible and efficient solutions to unify disparate and often siloed sets of not only transactional data but also demographic, ethnographic and behavioral data as well, in order to provide insights that are truly actionable.




Cost and Performance Pressures—As customers face constant cost pressures, they are increasingly dependent upon extracting greater value from information solutions. Whether it is identity verification, managing risk, or regulatory compliance, customers are increasingly more sophisticated, requiring enhanced performance that provides fast, accurate, and cost-effective solutions to satisfy their business objectives. Improving performance can mean delivering the right information at the right time at greater scale, or providing the most intuitive information as rapidly as possible to capitalize on opportunities or reduce risk. Superior analytics combined with unified data assets delivers competitive advantages to our customers as they cope with these pressures.
 Delivering Solutions for Complex Problems Using Scalable Analytics—The larger and more complex a data set, the more difficult it is to derive and provide sustained levels of performance and insight. The highly-fragmented nature of data across multiple mediums and often siloed within organizations, the historical proliferation of data augmented by the recent acceleration of the digital transformation, and lack of robust technology inhibits the ability to create a unified data asset. There is an inherent need for information solutions that allow organizations to leverage unified data assets for actionable intelligence in support of their operational workflows and in a more efficient manner.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe our leading-edge technology platform, massive database, and dynamic and intuitive solutions deliver superior capabilities to our customers. Our solutions enable our customers to make more informed inquiries regarding their challenges and better decisions to solve their most complex problems. We believe the following competitive strengths will continue to deliver an unrivaled value proposition that further drives our differentiation:
 •Transformative and Innovative Cloud-Native Technology Platform—Through the power of our platform, CORE, we offer a comprehensive suite of information solutions. Our cloud-native, data and industry agnostic platform enables us to assimilate, structure, and unify billions of disparate records to create comprehensive views that provide identity intelligence, and to present these insights in real-time via analytical interfaces. We believe our platform’s speed, power, extensibility and scalability are key differentiators in the marketplace.
 •Massive Unified Data Asset—Data is the lifeblood of our technology platform, and of modern society. We leverage our CORE platform to build massive proprietary datasets and apply analytics in real-time to provide actionable insights. Our data is compiled from a myriad of online and offline sources, both structured and unstructured, including public record, publicly-available, proprietary, and self-reported data. Public record data includes personal information, as well as property, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, automotive, phone and other information aggregated from companies specializing in data aggregation, public record databases, and publicly-available sources. Proprietary data is internally generated data unified by proprietary algorithms and analytic processes. Through next-generation technology and proprietary algorithms, we efficiently ingest these datasets, structure them into normalized form, and unify the data to resolve unique identities so as to create an actionable, real-time view of the information for various use cases, delivering greater intelligence to our customers and enhancing their decision-making capabilities across all markets and industries.
Our Platform and Solutions
 Leveraging cloud-native proprietary technology and applying machine learning and advanced analytical capabilities, CORE provides essential solutions to public and private sector organizations through intuitive, easy-to-use analytical interfaces. With massive data assets consisting of public-record, proprietary and publicly-available data, our differentiated information and innovative platform and solutions deliver intelligence relating to all things identity – entities, relationships, affiliations, interactions, and events. Our solutions are used today to enable frictionless commerce, to ensure safety, and to reduce fraud and the concomitant expense borne by society.
Our Sales, Distribution and Marketing
 Inside Sales—Our inside sales team cultivates relationships, and ultimately closes business, with their end-user markets. These professionals are relationship-based sellers with experience in identifying customers’ needs and clearly explaining and defining products that provide solutions to those needs.
 Strategic Sales—While the majority of our direct sales efforts are supported through professional inside sales staff, major accounts within certain industries require a more personal, face-to-face strategic sales approach. We continue to expand this team to meet the demand of the markets.




Distributors, Resellers, and Strategic Partners—In conjunction with direct-to-customer sales efforts, we engage value-added distributors, resellers, and strategic partners that have a significant foothold in many of the industries that we have not historically served, as well as to further penetrate those industries that we do serve. This allows us to rapidly penetrate these markets while also significantly reducing overhead associated with direct sales and support efforts.
 Marketing—We have implemented several methods to market our products, including participation in trade shows and seminars, advertising, public relations, distribution of sales literature and product specifications and ongoing communication with prospective customers, distributors, resellers, strategic partners and our installed base of current customers.
 Our Strategy
 We are committed to developing innovative technology and using our analytical capabilities to deliver solutions that transform the way organizations interact with information. We are advancing our business through the following strategic approach:
 •Transform Data Into Intelligence—Our massive, unified data asset, integrated with our leading technology platform and solutions, delivers actionable intelligence to organizations across diverse industries. As the digital transformation accelerates, the data generated therefrom increases rapidly. Derived semantic insight increases exponentially with each new data asset, creating compounded additional value that can be used by supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. As we identify, assimilate and unify these new data assets, our solutions expand in applicability to larger-sized customers as well as additional industries and uses cases within.
 •Widen Our Technology Lead—Unlike legacy technologies, our platform was built in the cloud from the ground up. Due to its cloud-native construct, CORE demonstrates increased speed and scalability as compared to legacy constructs. As competitors invest millions of dollars transitioning platforms from dated infrastructures to primarily hybrid-cloud environments, we are advancing and expanding our cloud-native technology and functionality to meet customer need, as customers increasingly rely on the speed, reliability, security, scalability and efficiencies that only the cloud delivers. We will continue to invest in our technology and people to widen our lead over competitive technologies.
 •Enhance Functionality and Develop New Products—We operate with a relentless focus on innovation and the customer experience. Customers rely on our solutions to solve complex problems, to make better data-driven decisions, and to produce greater efficiencies in their workflow. We are devoted to enhancing the functionality of our current solutions and to developing new products, to enable more intelligent interaction with information and to become further engrained in the daily workflows of our customers. As we introduce greater functionality and additional products, it will serve to expand the applications of our solutions, and increase the opportunities whereby our customers can solve for existing and evolving problems generated by disparate and siloed data assets. 
Our Competition
 Competition in the data and analytics sector centers on innovation, product stability, pricing and customer service. The market for our products and services is highly competitive and is subject to constant change. We compete on the basis of innovative technology, differentiated solutions, analytical capabilities, integration with our customers’ technology, customer relationships, service stability, and price. We believe we are well-positioned to effectively compete on all fronts.
 Our competitors vary widely in size and nature of the products and services they offer. There are a large number of competitors who offer products and services in specialized areas, such as fraud prevention, risk management and decisioning solutions. We believe our innovative technology, analytical capabilities, robust and unified database, and the intelligent design of our cloud-native infrastructure will allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competition in flexibility, capability, service and price.
 Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources, better name recognition and a larger customer base. Even if we introduce advanced products that meet evolving customer requirements in a timely manner, there can be no assurance that our new products will gain market acceptance.
 Certain companies in the data and analytics sector have expanded their product lines or technologies in recent years as a result of acquisitions. Further, more companies have developed products which conform to existing and emerging industry standards and have sought to compete on the basis of price. We anticipate increased competition from large data and analytics vendors. Increased competition in the data and analytics sector could result in significant price competition, reduced profit margins or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future with current or new competitors.




Concentration of Customers
 We have established relationships with a number of customers, many of whom could unilaterally terminate their relationship with us or materially reduce the amount of business they conduct with us at any time. Market competition, customer requirements, customer financial condition and customer consolidation through mergers or acquisitions also could adversely affect our ability to continue or expand these relationships. There is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements, maintain relationships with any of our customers on acceptable terms or at all or collect amounts owed to us from insolvent customers. The loss of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue.
As of December 31, 2022, one individual customer accounted for 11% of our accounts receivable, net. As of December 31, 2021, no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable, net.
 Concentration of Suppliers
 Our products and services depend extensively upon continued access to and receipt of data from external sources, including data received from the major credit bureaus, including our largest data supplier. Our other data suppliers include strategic partners, as well as various government and public record databases. Our largest data supplier, with whom we have expanded our relationship while securing what we believe to be favorable business terms over the years, accounted for 49% of our total data acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amended and renewed term of the agreement with this supplier ends June 30, 2026. We may elect to extend the term for an additional twelve months upon written notice to this supplier at least 30 days prior to the end of the amended and renewed term. During the term of the agreement, either party has the right to terminate the agreement: (i) in the event of the other party’s failure to cure a material breach, and (ii) in the event of the other party’s insolvency. In addition, this supplier may terminate this agreement by providing not less than 12 months’ advance written notice to us and we may terminate this agreement by providing not less than 24 months’ advance written notice to this supplier. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining minimum purchase commitments through the end of the amended and renewed term is $18.6 million. If we are unable to maintain our relationship with our largest data supplier, our ability to provide products and services could be negatively impacted, as we would need to secure comparable data on similar terms, which would require significant time, expense, and resources, and may in the short-term adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and, if we are unable to establish a similar relationship with other data suppliers over time, could have a long-term material impact on our business and financial condition.
Our Intellectual Property
 We avail ourself of applicable trade secret and unfair competition laws to protect our proprietary technology, trademark law to protect our trademarks and domain names, and copyright laws to protect our content relating to, among other things, websites and marketing materials. Our intellectual property rights are embodied in confidential and proprietary technology and data, trademarked brands relating to our business units, products, services, and solutions, original content on our materials such as websites and marketing materials, and domain names. With respect to our trademarks, we maintain an extensive portfolio of perpetual common law and federally-registered trademark rights across several brands. We have also sought protection and registration of certain brands and trademarks internationally, such as in Europe and Canada. At present, we do not hold any issued patents.
 We use data acquired through licensing rights from approximately 20 providers. The loss of any one of these providers could have an immediate near-term impact on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Also see “Concentration of Suppliers” above.
 Regulatory Matters
 Our business is subject to various federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, including, without limitation, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 6801- 6809) (the “GLBA”), the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (18 U.S.C. §§ 2721- 2725) (the “DPPA”) and the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”). A change in any one of a number of the laws, rules, or regulations applicable to our business or the enactment of new or amended legislation or industry regulations pertaining to consumer or private sector privacy issues could have a material adverse impact on information services. Legislation or industry regulations regarding consumer or private sector privacy issues could place restrictions upon the collection, sharing and use of information that is currently legally available, which could materially increase our cost of collecting and maintaining some data. These types of legislation or industry regulations could also prohibit us from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ requirements and our profitability and cash flow targets.
Seasonality
 Our results are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Historically, certain products experience seasonal pressure during the fourth quarter.
 Management Team
 Our management team has a track record of strong performance and significant expertise in the markets we serve. We have built the leading companies in our industry, creating significant shareholder value. We continue to attract and retain experienced management talent for our business. Our team has deep knowledge of the data and analytics sector and expertise across the various industries that we serve. Our team has overseen the expansion of our proprietary technology platform while managing ongoing initiatives, including the transition from a development-focused company to a sales-driven company. As a result, we are well positioned to continue to successfully drive growth organically.
Our Employees
 We employ a total of 186 full-time employees and one part-time employee as of December 31, 2022. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization, and none are party to any collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good. Competition in the recruiting of personnel in the data and analytics sector is intense. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate and retain qualified sales and marketing, executive and administrative and technical personnel. To date, we have not experienced significant difficulties in attracting or retaining qualified employees.
