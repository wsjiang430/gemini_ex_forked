The 10,000 shares represent all of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Design Limited. The transaction was consummated on September 9, 2021.

Also on September 9, 2021, Compass North Holdings Limited purchased 8,280,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price of US$0.0524 per share, from Mr. Mario Todd, our previous majority shareholder.
