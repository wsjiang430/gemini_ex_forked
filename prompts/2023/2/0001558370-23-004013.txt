Item 1.     Business
We are a broadcast company primarily engaged in acquiring, developing and operating broadcast properties. As of February 28, 2023, we owned seventy-nine FM, thirty-four AM radio stations and eighty metro signals serving twenty-seven markets. Our principal executive offices are located at 73 Kercheval, Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan 48236. We are a Florida corporation, reorganized in 2020. We were originally a Delaware corporation that was organized in 1986. During 2022, our founder and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Edward K. Christian passed away. As of the date of his passing, Mr. Christian held approximately 65% of the combined voting power of the Company’s Common Stock. His passing resulted in the conversion of his Class B Shares into Class A Shares that were transferred to an estate planning trust that now owns approximately 16% of the common stock outstanding. We were also required to make certain payments to his estate as outlined in his employment agreement.
Strategy
Our strategy is to operate top billing radio stations in mid-sized markets, which we define as markets ranked from 20 to 200 out of the markets summarized by Investing in Radio Market Report.
Programming and marketing are key components in our strategy to achieve top ratings in our radio operations. In many of our markets, the three or four most highly rated radio stations receive a disproportionately high share of the market’s advertising revenues. As a result, a station’s revenue is dependent upon its ability to maximize its number of listeners/viewers within an advertiser’s given demographic parameters. In certain cases we use attributes other than specific market listener data for sales activities. In those markets where sufficient alternative data is available, we do not subscribe to an independent listener rating service.
The radio stations that we own and/or operate employ a variety of programming formats, including Classic Hits, Adult Hits, Top 40, Country, Country Legends, Mainstream/Hot/Soft Adult Contemporary, Pure Oldies, Classic Rock, and News/Talk. We regularly perform extensive market research, including music evaluations, focus groups and strategic vulnerability studies. Our stations also employ audience promotions to further develop and secure a loyal following.
We concentrate on the development of strong decentralized local management, which is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the stations we own and/or operate. We compensate local management based on the station’s financial performance, as well as other performance factors that are deemed to affect the long-term ability of the stations to achieve financial performance objectives. Corporate management is responsible for long-range planning, establishing policies and procedures, resource allocation and monitoring the activities of the stations.
Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the “Telecommunications Act”), we are permitted to own up to eight radio stations in a single market. See “Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting”. We seek to acquire reasonably priced broadcast properties with significant growth potential that are located in markets with well-established and relatively stable economies. We often focus on local economies supported by a strong presence of state or federal government or one or more major universities. Future acquisitions will be subject to the availability of financing, the terms of our credit facility, and compliance with the Communications Act of 1934 (the “Communications Act”) and Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) rules.

Advertising Sales
Our primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations. Depending on the format of a particular radio station, there are a predetermined number of advertisements broadcast each hour. We determine the number of advertisements broadcast hourly that can maximize a station’s available revenue dollars without jeopardizing listening/viewing levels. While there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year. Any change in our revenue, with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold, is generally the result of pricing adjustments, which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory.
Advertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on a station’s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers, the number of stations in the market competing for the same demographic group, the supply of and demand for radio advertising time, and other qualitative factors including rates charged by competing radio stations within a given market. Radio rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon drive-time hours. Most advertising contracts are short-term, generally running for only a few weeks. This allows broadcasters the ability to modify advertising rates as dictated by changes in station ownership within a market, changes in listener/viewer ratings and changes in the business climate within a particular market.
Approximately $108,999,000 or 89% of our gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 (approximately $102,367,000 or 89% in fiscal 2021 and approximately $86,562,000 or 84% in fiscal 2020) was generated from the sale of local advertising. Additional revenue is generated from the sale of national advertising, network compensation payments, barter and other miscellaneous transactions. In all of our markets, we attempt to maintain a local sales force that is generally larger than our competitors. The principal goal in our sales efforts is to develop long-standing customer relationships through frequent direct contacts, which we believe represents a competitive advantage. We also typically provide incentives to our sales staff to seek out new opportunities resulting in the establishment of new client relationships, as well as new sources of revenue, not directly associated with the sale of broadcast time.
Each of our stations also engages independent national sales representatives to assist us in obtaining national advertising revenues. These representatives obtain advertising through national advertising agencies and receive a commission from us based on our net revenue from the advertising obtained. Total gross revenue resulting from national advertising in fiscal 2022 was approximately $13,657,000 or 11% of our gross revenue (approximately $13,138,000 or 11% in fiscal 2021 and approximately $16,361,000 or 16% in fiscal 2020). Gross national political revenue is included in these numbers.
Competition
Radio broadcasting is a highly competitive business. Our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations, as well as other media, within their markets. Our radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content and by employing on-air talent which appeals to a particular demographic group. By building a strong listener base comprised of a specific demographic group in each of our markets, we are able to attract advertisers seeking to reach these listeners.
Other media, including broadcast television and/or radio (as applicable), cable television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, the Internet, coupons and billboard advertising, also compete with us for advertising revenues.
The radio broadcasting industry is also subject to competition from new media technologies, such as the delivery of audio programming by cable and satellite television systems, satellite radio systems, direct reception from satellites, and streaming of audio on the Internet.

Seasonality
Our revenue varies throughout the year. Advertising expenditures, our primary source of revenue, is generally lowest in the first quarter. 
Environmental Compliance
As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and regulations will not require us to make significant expenditures of funds.
Human Capital Resources
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop and retain top industry talent that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we broadcast. To support this goal, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare for key roles and leadership positions for the future; reward employees through competitive industry pay, benefits and other programs, instill our culture with a focus on ethical behavior and enhance our employees’ performance through investment in current technology, tools and training to enable our employees to operate at a high level. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 585 full-time employees and 225 part-time employees, none of whom are represented by unions. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
We employ several high-profile personalities with large loyal audiences in their respective markets. We have entered into employment and non-competition agreements with our President and with most of our on-air personalities, as well as non-competition agreements with our commissioned sales representatives.
We are committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our management teams are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our employees must adhere to a code of conduct that sets standards for appropriate ethical behavior.

Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting
Introduction. The ownership, operation and sale of radio stations, including those licensed to us, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under authority granted by the Communications Act. Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines the particular frequencies, locations and operating power of stations; issues, renews, revokes and modifies station licenses; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the Communications Act. For additional information on the impact of FCC regulations and the introduction of new technologies on our operations, see “Forward Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” contained elsewhere in this report.
​

The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC rules (Title 47 Code of Federal Regulation, Chapter I, Subchapters A and C) and the public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
License Renewal. Radio broadcasting licenses are granted for maximum terms of eight years, and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. Under its “two-step” renewal process, the FCC must grant a renewal application if it finds that during the preceding term the licensee has served the public interest, convenience and necessity, and there have been no serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. If a renewal applicant fails to meet these standards, the FCC may either deny its application or grant the application on such terms and conditions as are appropriate, including renewal for less than the full 8-year term. In making the determination of whether to renew the license, the FCC may not consider whether the public interest would be served by the grant of a license to a person other than the renewal applicant. If the FCC, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, finds that the licensee has failed to meet the requirements for renewal and no mitigating factors justify the imposition of lesser sanctions, the FCC may issue an order denying the renewal application, and only thereafter may the FCC accept applications for a construction permit specifying the broadcasting facilities of the former licensee. Petitions may be filed to deny the renewal applications of our stations, but any such petitions must raise issues that would cause the FCC to deny a renewal application under the standards adopted in the “two-step” renewal process. Failure to renew a license could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Radio station licenses generally expire along with the licenses of all other radio stations in a given state. The FCC accepts renewal applications for various groups of radio stations every two months. The last cycle having begun in June 2019, concluded for the Company’s stations in June 2022. All the Company’s renewal applications were routinely granted by the FCC. In January 2018 and again in February 2022, the FCC designated the renewal applications of radio stations (not the Company’s) for hearing based on the stations’ records of extended periods of silence during and following their respective license renewal terms. Under the Communications Act, if a broadcast station fails to transmit signals for any consecutive 12-month period, the FCC license expires at the end of that period, unless the FCC exercises its discretion to extend or reinstate the license “to promote equity and fairness.” The FCC, to date, has rarely exercised such discretion. Further, the FCC has revoked the licenses of broadcast stations that failed to pay regulatory fees. The Company is current in the payment of regulatory fees to the FCC.

(2) | In order of increasing power, AM stations are classified as: Class D, C, B or A. (See Title 47 C.F.R. §73.21 for a definition of AM station class information, including operating power.) In order of increasing power and antenna height, FM stations are classified as: Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1, C0 or C. (See Title 47 C.F.R. §73.210 for a definition of FM station class information, including effective radiated power [“ERP”] and antenna height.) WISE, KPSZ, KPUG, KGMI, KBAI, WNYY, WHCU, WINQ(AM) and WSVA operate with lower power at night than during daytime. WYSE, WBCO, WQEZ, WKFN, WHBG, WZBK and WLZX(AM) are “Class D” stations that operate daytime only or with greatly reduced power at night. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
 Ownership Matters. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant or renew a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with the Communications Act’s limitations on alien ownership; compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of broadcast, cable and newspaper properties; and the “character” and other qualifications of the licensee and those persons holding “attributable or cognizable” interests therein.
​
Under the Communications Act (Section 310(b)), broadcast licenses may not be granted to any corporation having more than one-fifth of its issued and outstanding capital stock owned or voted by aliens (including non-U.S. corporations), foreign governments or their representatives (collectively, “Aliens”). The Communications Act also prohibits a corporation, without FCC waiver, from holding a broadcast license if that corporation is controlled, directly or indirectly, by another corporation in which more than 25% of the issued and outstanding capital stock is owned or voted by Aliens. The FCC has issued interpretations of existing law under which these restrictions in modified form apply to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships. We serve as a holding company for our various radio station subsidiaries (and as such we cannot have more than 25% of our stock owned or voted by Aliens).
The FCC has adopted rules to extend to broadcast licensees the same rules and procedures that common carrier wireless licensees use to seek approval for foreign ownership, with broadcast-specific modifications.

10



The rules and procedures allow a broadcast licensee to request in a petition for declaratory ruling under Title 47 U.S.C. Section 310(b)(4):

(1) | approval of up to and including 100 percent aggregate foreign ownership of its controlling U.S. parent;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | approval for a proposed, controlling foreign investor to increase its equity and/or voting interests in the U.S. parent up to and including 100 percent at some future time without filing a new petition—this applies where the foreign investor would acquire an initial controlling interest of less than 100 percent; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | approval for a non-controlling foreign investor named in the petition to increase its equity and/or voting interests in the U.S. parent at some future time, up to and including a non-controlling 49.99 percent equity and/or voting interest.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rules require the Company to seek specific approval only of foreign individuals or entities with a greater than 5 percent ownership interest (or, in certain situations, an interest greater than 10 percent).
The rules allow broadcast licensees that have foreign ownership rulings to apply those rulings to all radio and television broadcast licenses then held or subsequently proposed to be acquired by the same licensee and its covered subsidiaries and affiliates, regardless of the broadcast service (e.g., AM, FM, or TV) or the geographic area in which the stations are located.
The methodology provides a framework for a publicly traded licensee or controlling U.S. parent to ascertain its foreign ownership using information that is “known or reasonably should be known” to the company in the ordinary course of business.
For publicly traded licensees and U.S. parent companies (like the Company), the rules formalize the current equitable practice of recognizing a licensee’s good faith efforts to comply with Section 310(b) where the non-compliance was due solely to circumstances beyond the licensee’s control that were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the licensee.
We are permitted to own an unlimited number of radio stations on a nationwide basis (subject to the local ownership restrictions described below).
Under the rules, the number of radio stations one party may own in a local Nielsen Audio-rated radio market is determined by the number of full-power commercial and noncommercial educational (“NCE”) radio stations in the market as determined by Nielsen Audio and BIA Advisory Services, LLC d/b/a BIA/Kelsey. Radio markets that are not Nielsen Audio rated are determined by analysis of the broadcast coverage contours of the radio stations involved.
​
Under the Communications Act, and the FCC’s “Local Radio Ownership Rule,” we are permitted to own radio stations (without regard to the audience shares of the stations) based upon the number of full-power commercial and NCE radio stations in the relevant radio market as follows:
​

​ | ​ | ​ 
-------------------+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number of Stations | ​ | 
In Radio Market | | Number of Stations We Can Own 
​ | ​ | ​ 
14 or Fewer | | Total of 5 stations, not more than 3 in the same service (AM or FM), except the Company cannot own more than 50% of the stations in the market.
15-29 | | Total of 6 stations, not more than 4 in the same service (AM or FM). 
30-44 | | Total of 7 stations, not more than 4 in the same service (AM or FM). 
45 or More | | Total of 8 stations, not more than 5 in the same service (AM or FM).

The FCC’s 2010/2014 Quadrennial Review Order on Reconsideration, 32 FCC Rcd 9802 (2017), modified the FCC’s media ownership rules by: (1) eliminating the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership and radio/television cross-ownership rules; (2) revising the local television ownership rule by eliminating the “eight voices” test and permitting applicants to seek the combination of two top-four ranked stations in a given market on a case-by-case basis; and (3) deeming joint sales agreements between television stations to be non-attributable. In FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 141 S. Ct. 1150 (2021), the U. S. Supreme Court reversed a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit which had vacated the FCC’s 2017 order.  The FCC is required by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to review its media ownership rules every four years to determine whether they remain “necessary in the public interest as the result of competition.” On December 12, 2018, the FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) to initiate the 2018 Quadrennial Review proceeding. On June 4, 2021, the FCC released a Public Notice seeking to refresh the record in the 2018 Quadrennial Review proceeding. That proceeding remains pending. On December 22, 2022, the FCC’s Media Bureau released a Public Notice commencing the 2022 Quadrennial Review of the FCC’s media ownership rules. Although they remain subject to the ongoing 2018 Quadrennial Review proceeding, the three rules currently in place and subject to the 2022 review are the Local Radio Ownership Rule and the Local Television Ownership Rule—which limit ownership by a single entity of broadcast radio or television stations in local markets respectively—and the Dual Network Rule, which effectively prohibits mergers among the “Big Four” broadcast television networks (ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC). In the context of these three rules, as with prior reviews, the FCC is seeking information regarding the media marketplace, including ongoing trends or developments (e.g., consolidation, technological innovation, or the emergence of new video or audio options for consumers). The Company cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt new or revise existing media ownership rules.
New rules that could be promulgated under the Communications Act may permit us to own, operate, control or have a cognizable interest in additional radio broadcast stations if the FCC determines that such ownership, operation, control or cognizable interest will result in an increase in the number of radio stations in operation. No firm date has been established for initiation of this rule-making proceeding. New rules could restrict the Company’s ability to acquire additional radio and television stations in some markets. The Court and FCC proceedings are ongoing and we cannot predict what action, if any, the Court or the FCC may take to further modify its rules. Due to changes in local radio markets, the ownership of some of our radio stations, in the future, could exceed the current ownership limits imposed by the Local Radio Ownership Rule. Their current ownership structure is “grandfathered” by the FCC. Absent a waiver, it might not be possible to sell all of them as currently configured in “clusters” to a single purchaser. The statements herein are based solely on the FCC’s multiple ownership rules in effect as of the date hereof and do not include any forward-looking statements concerning compliance with any future multiple ownership rules.

All commercial broadcasters are required to file a “biennial” ownership report, the next report due by December 1, 2023, describing the ownership of their stations as of October 1, 2023. The FCC eliminated the prior requirement to file with the FCC paper copies of certain agreements, corporate organization documents, and the like. Instead, a broadcaster is required to upload copies of these documents to the station’s online public inspection file (“OPIF”), or provide a list of such documents and make them available to a requesting party. The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to “attributable” interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other association. In the case of corporations holding broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation’s stock (or 20% or more of such stock in the case of certain passive investors that are holding stock for investment purposes only) are generally attributable, as are positions of an officer or director of a corporate parent of a broadcast licensee. Currently, none of our directors has an attributable interest or interests in companies applying for or licensed to operate broadcast stations other than the Company. 
The FCC’s ownership attribution rules (a) apply to limited liability companies and registered limited liability partnerships the same attribution rules that the FCC applies to limited partnerships; and (b) include an equity/debt plus (“EDP”) rule that attributes the other media interests of an otherwise passive investor if the investor is (1) a “major-market program supplier” that supplies over 15% of a station’s total weekly broadcast programming hours, or (2) a same-market media entity subject to the FCC’s multiple ownership rules (including broadcasters, cable operators and newspapers) so that its interest in a licensee or other media entity in that market will be attributed if that interest, aggregating both debt and equity holdings, exceeds 33% of the total asset value (equity plus debt) of the licensee or media entity. We could be prohibited from acquiring a financial interest in stations in markets where application of the EDP rule would result in us having an attributable interest in the stations. 
In addition to the FCC’s multiple ownership rules, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission and some state governments have the authority to examine proposed transactions for compliance with antitrust statutes and guidelines. The Antitrust Division has issued “civil investigative demands” and obtained consent decrees requiring the divestiture of stations in a particular market based on antitrust concerns.

Programming and Operation. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” Licensees are required to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. Complaints from listeners concerning a station’s programming often will be considered by the FCC when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee, although such complaints may be filed at any time and generally may be considered by the FCC at any time. Stations also must follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identification, the advertisement of contests and lotteries, obscene and indecent broadcasts, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation. In 2020, the FCC entered into a Consent Decree with Sinclair Broadcast Group, which agreed to pay a $48 million dollar fine to settle issues related to sponsorship identification violations, among other matters. The FCC also entered into a Consent Decree with Cumulus Radio to settle violations of the sponsorship identification requirements in connection with the broadcast of issue ads promoting a construction project in New Hampshire. There are other examples of FCC enforcement action for violation of the sponsorship identification requirements. A licensee that broadcasts or advertises information about a contest it conducts must fully and accurately disclose the material terms of the contest, and conduct the contest substantially as announced or advertised over the air or on the Internet. The disclosure of material terms must be made by either periodic disclosures broadcast on the station or written disclosures on the station's Internet web site. Violation of the rule can result in significant fines. In 2020, the FCC fined a broadcaster $5,200 for failing to conduct its contests as advertised by failing to award prizes in a timely manner. Another licensee entered into a Consent Decree with the FCC, paying a fine of $125,000 for, among other things, predetermining the outcome of a contest. The FCC requires the owners of antenna supporting structures (towers) to register them with the FCC. As an owner of such towers, our subsidiaries are subject to the registration requirements. On January 13, 2020, the FCC released an Order confirming a Consent Decree whereby the owner of several antenna structures agreed to pay the government a civil penalty of $1,130,000 and develop a Compliance Plan requiring reports for two years as a result of (1) failing to conduct required daily inspections of the lighting systems at 10 towers, (2) failing to completely log lighting failures at 7 towers, and (3) failing to timely notify the FCC of its acquisition of 2 towers. In 2017, the FCC eliminated the broadcast main studio rule. The FCC retained the requirement that stations maintain a local or toll-free telephone number to ensure consumers have ready access to their local stations. The FCC’s rules require cable operators, direct satellite TV providers, broadcast radio licensees, and satellite radio licensees to post public inspection files to the FCC's online database (the “OPIF” referred to above) rather than maintaining them in a local public inspection file. The FCC believes posting these files to the OPIF renders the materials more widely accessible to the public. The Company’s radio stations post their public inspection files to the FCC’s website. The FCC has warned licensees of possible enforcement action if these files are found not to be in compliance at the time of license renewal. Because of inadvertent untimely posting to the OPIF of certain political records at stations owned by one of the Company’s subsidiaries, that subsidiary was obliged to enter into a Consent Decree with the FCC (FCC Order, DA 20-1263, released October 26, 2020). The Consent Decree required Company employees responsible for performing, supervising, overseeing, or managing activities related to the maintenance of online political files to thoroughly understand the Company’s obligation to comply with laws regulating political broadcasting and to promptly report to the FCC any noncompliance with those laws. The affected subsidiary filed a report with the FCC on December 8, 2021, regarding its record of compliance with the political laws and the Company’s obligations under the Consent Decree terminated as of February 7, 2022. The FCC in 2020 revised its rules governing the publication of local notice of the filing of certain broadcast applications. FCC licensees, like the Company’s subsidiaries, must maintain a tab on their station websites where the public can view the OPIF and a tab where notices describing pending applications must be posted, rather than printing such notices in local newspapers.
​
The Company is required to pay (1) FCC filing fees in connection with its applications and (2) annual regulatory fees determined by the number and character of the radio stations the Company owns as of October 1 of each prior year.

 Equal Employment Opportunity Rules. Equal employment opportunity (EEO) rules and policies for broadcasters prohibit discrimination by broadcasters and multichannel video programming distributors. They also require broadcasters to provide notice of job vacancies and to undertake additional outreach measures, such as job fairs and scholarship programs. The rules mandate a “three prong” outreach program; i.e., Prong 1: widely disseminate information concerning each full-time (30 hours or more) job vacancy, except for vacancies filled in exigent circumstances; Prong 2: provide notice of each full-time job vacancy to recruitment organizations that have requested such notice; and Prong 3: complete two (for broadcast employment units with five to ten full-time employees or that are located in smaller markets) or four (for employment units with more than ten full-time employees located in larger markets) longer-term recruitment initiatives within a two-year period. These include, for example, job fairs, scholarship and internship programs, and other community events designed to inform the public as to employment opportunities in broadcasting. The rules mandate extensive record keeping and reporting requirements. In 2017, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling permitting broadcast stations to use the internet for job postings as their sole means of recruiting employees (so long as the postings reach all segments of the station’s community). The EEO rules are enforced through review at renewal time, and through random audits and targeted investigations resulting from information received as to possible violations. The FCC has not yet decided on whether and how to apply the EEO rule to part-time positions. Failure to observe these or other rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of “short” (less than the full eight-year) renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license. As announced in an NPRM released June 21, 2019 (MB Docket No. 19-177), the FCC is reviewing the EEO rules. In the NPRM, the FCC seeks comment on its track record on EEO enforcement, whether the agency should make improvements to EEO compliance and enforcement, and invites comment on its audit program. In a Further NPRM (MB Docket No. 98-204), released July 23, 2021, the FCC sought to refresh the existing record regarding the statutorily mandated collection of data on the FCC Form 395-B, as contemplated by the Act. This employment report form is intended to gather workforce composition data from broadcasters on an annual basis but the form and data have not been collected for many years. The filing of the form was suspended in 2001 in the wake of a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) vacating certain aspects of the FCC's Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) requirements. While the FCC in 2004 adopted revised regulations regarding the filing of Form 395-B and updated the form, the requirement that broadcasters once again submit the form to the FCC was suspended until issues were resolved regarding confidentiality of the employment data. To date, those issues remain unresolved, and the filing of Form 395-B remains suspended. The FCC is seeking “to refresh the record” regarding the collection of broadcaster workforce composition data and obtain further input on the legal, logistical, and technical issues surrounding FCC Form 395-B. On February 3, 2023, the FCC released a Public Notice, “Expanding Digital and Media Ownership Opportunities for Women and Minorities,”announcing a symposium to explore the challenges as well as possible creative solutions to increasing ownership opportunities for women and people of color to achieve success and viewpoint diversity in all facets of media – TV, radio, cable, and streaming.The Company cannot predict whether, or if changes may be made as a result of these NPRMs and the symposium. 
​
Time Brokerage Agreements. As is common in the industry, we have previously entered into what have commonly been referred to as Time Brokerage Agreements (“TBAs”) which are sometimes termed “Local Marketing Agreements.” Such arrangements are an extension of the concept of agreements under which a licensee of a station sells (or “leases”) blocks of time on its station to an entity or entities which purchase the blocks of time and use the time to broadcast material the lessee has produced, or which sell their own commercial advertising announcements during the time periods in question. While these agreements may take varying forms, under a typical TBA, separately owned and licensed radio or television stations agree to enter into cooperative arrangements of varying sorts, subject to compliance with the requirements of antitrust laws and with the FCC’s rules and policies. Under these types of arrangements, separately-owned stations agree to function cooperatively in terms of programming, advertising sales, and other matters, subject to the licensee of each station maintaining independent control over the financing, programming and station operations of its own station. One typical type of TBA is a programming agreement between two separately-owned radio or television stations serving a common service area, whereby the licensee of one station purchases substantial portions of the broadcast day on the other licensee’s station, subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee, and sells advertising time during such program segments.

The FCC’s rules provide that a station purchasing (brokering or leasing) time on another station serving the same market will be considered to have an attributable ownership interest in the brokered station for purposes of the FCC’s multiple ownership rules. As a result, under the rules, a broadcast station will not be permitted to enter into a time brokerage agreement giving it the right to purchase more than 15% of the broadcast time, on a weekly basis, of another local station that it could not own under the local ownership rules of the FCC’s multiple ownership rules. Effective October 22, 2020, the FCC eliminated Title 47 C.F.R. § 73.3556, a rule that prohibited the duplication of programming on co-owned radio stations in the same market. A petition for reconsideration of that action as to FM duplication is pending. The Company cannot predict how the FCC may act on that petition.
The FCC has adopted rules that require the broadcast of a specific disclosure at the time of broadcast if material aired pursuant to a lease of time on a station has been sponsored, paid for, or furnished by a foreign governmental entity. Consistent with the Communications Act and the FCC’s sponsorship identification rules, the Company’s stations are required to disclose political programming or programming involving the discussion of a controversial issue if such programming is provided by a foreign governmental entity for free, or for nominal compensation, as an inducement to air. The rule requires the Company to exercise reasonable diligence (and obtain certifications from lessees) to ascertain whether the foreign sponsorship disclosure requirements apply at the time of the lease agreement and at any renewal thereof. A station must place in its OPIF on a quarterly basis certain information if the station broadcasts such foreign-sponsored programming. On October 6, 2022, the FCC released a Second NPRM, seeking comment on establishing a requirement that licensees require a lessee to use a specific certification form to disclose whether a lessee is or is not a foreign governmental entity and whether it knows of any entity or individual further back in the programming production or distribution chain that qualifies as a foreign governmental entity. If adopted, the proposed rules would require the Company to upload the certifications to the OPIF whether or not the lessee has a connection to a foreign government. The Company cannot predict whether such new rules will be adopted, and if so, the form they might take.
​
Other FCC Requirements.
Low Power FM Radio. There exists a “low power radio service” on the FM band (“LPFM”) in which the FCC authorizes the construction and operation of NCE FM stations with up to 100 watts ERP with antenna height above average terrain (“HAAT”) at up to 30 meters (100 feet). This combination is calculated to produce a service area radius of approximately 3.5 miles. The FCC’s rules will not permit any broadcaster or other media entity subject to the FCC’s ownership rules to control or hold an attributable interest in an LPFM station or enter into related operating agreements with an LPFM licensee. Thus, absent a waiver, we could not own or program an LPFM station. LPFM stations are allocated throughout the FM broadcast band, (i.e., 88.1 to 107.9 MHz), although they must operate with a NCE format. The FCC has established allocation rules that require FM stations to be separated by specified distances to other stations on the same frequency, and stations on frequencies on the first, second and third channels adjacent to the center frequency. As required by the Local Community Radio Act of 2010, the FCC in 2012 modified its rules to maintain its existing minimum distance separation requirements for full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations that broadcast radio reading services via an analog subcarrier frequency to avoid potential interference by LPFM stations; and when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and LPFM stations, to ensure that: (i) licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and LPFM stations; (ii) such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and (iii) FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and LPFM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations. By Report and Order, released April 23, 2020, the FCC modified the LPFM technical rules in four main ways: (1) expanding the permissible use of directional antennas; (2) expanding the definition of minor change applications for LPFM stations; (3) allowing LPFM stations to own FM boosters; and (4) permitting LPFM and Class D FM stations operating on the NCE FM reserved band (channels 201 to 220) to propose facilities short-spaced to television stations operating on channel 6 (TV6) with the consent of the potentially affected stations. The FCC also took other less significant actions affecting the LPFM service.
​
​

On January 5, 2012, the FCC released a Report to Congress on the impact that LPFM stations would have on full-service commercial FM stations. The FCC “found no statistically reliable evidence that low-power FM stations have a substantial or consistent economic impact on full-service commercial FM stations,” and that “low-power FM stations generally do not have, and in the future are unlikely to have, a demonstrable economic impact on full-service commercial FM radio stations.” Some LPFM stations that broadcast commercial announcements in violation of the law could have a negative economic impact on the Company’s stations. Although rule-compliant LPFM stations compete for audience with the Company’s full-power and FM translator stations, the Company cannot predict whether there will be future negative economic impact on its stations.
As part of the transition of television stations from analog to digital operations, the FCC sought comment in a 2014 NPRM on whether to allow low power television (“LPTV”) stations (so-called “Franken FM” or “FM6” radio stations) on digital television channel 6 to continue to operate these analog FM radio-type services on an ancillary or supplementary basis. On June 7, 2022 (MB Docket No. 03-185), the FCC released a Fifth NPRM seeking comment on whether FM6 operations serve the public interest and should be authorized to continue in any capacity. The FCC limited the scope of FM6 operations to only those LPTV channel 6 stations with "active" FM6 engineering special temporary authority on the release date of the Fifth NPRM. This could result in eliminating or authorizing FM6 stations. The Company cannot predict whether Franken FM stations will become licensed radio services.
​
As a broadcaster, the Company is required to comply with the FCC rules implementing the Emergency Alert System (“EAS”). The Company’s stations must transmit Presidential messages during national emergencies and may transmit local messages, such as severe weather alerts and AMBER (America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response) alerts. On January 7, 2021, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau issued an “Enforcement Advisory” which highlighted EAS participants’ obligations, identified measures to improve the EAS, and warned that failure to comply with the EAS rules may subject a violator to sanctions including, but not limited to, substantial monetary forfeitures. Our stations are required periodically to file with the FCC forms reporting on the results of EAS tests. In September, 2022, the FCC adopted new EAS requirements directing EAS participants to check whether certain types of alerts are available in common alerting protocol (“CAP”) format and, if so, to transmit the CAP version of the alert rather than the legacy-formatted version. The FCC also prescribed text that EAS participants must broadcast using plain language terms. In an NPRM adopted October 27, 2022, the FCC proposed to require EAS participants to report to the FCC compromises of EAS equipment, communications systems, and services. The FCC proposed to require EAS participants to annually certify to having a cybersecurity risk management plan in place and to employ sufficient security measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their respective alerting systems. 
Use of FM Boosters for Geo-Targeting. By NPRM released December 1, 2020, the FCC sought comment on whether to modify the FCC’s rules governing the operation of FM booster stations by FM radio broadcasters in certain limited circumstances. Through its NPRM, the FCC sought comment regarding changes to the booster station rules that could enable FM broadcasters to use FM booster stations to air “geo-targeted” content (e.g., news, weather, and advertisements) independent of the signals of the booster’s primary station within different portions of the primary station's protected service contour for a limited period of time during the broadcast hour. The FCC has solicited public comment on tests of the proposed system. The Company cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt the proposed rules, and if adopted, whether the Company would use FM booster stations in this manner. The Company currently has no FM booster stations.

Digital Audio Radio Satellite Service and Internet Radio. In adopting its rules for the Digital Audio Radio Satellite Service (“DARS”) in the 2310-2360 MHz frequency band, the FCC stated, “although healthy satellite DARS systems are likely to have some adverse impact on terrestrial radio audience size, revenues and profits, the record does not demonstrate that licensing satellite DARS would have such a strong adverse impact that it threatens the provision of local service.” The FCC granted two nationwide licenses, one to XM Satellite Radio, which began broadcasting in May 2001, and a second to Sirius Satellite Radio, which began broadcasting in February 2002. The satellite radio systems provide multiple channels of audio programming in exchange for the payment of a subscription fee. The FCC approved the application of Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. and XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. to transfer control of the licenses and authorizations held by the two companies to one company, which is now known as Sirius XM Radio, Inc. Various companies have introduced devices that permit the reception of audio programming streamed over the Internet on home computers and on portable receivers such as cell phones, in automobiles, and through so-called “smart speakers” like Amazon’s Alexa service. A number of digital music providers have developed and are offering their product through the Internet. Terrestrial radio operators (including the Company) are also making their product available through the Internet. Due to interference generated by their electric motors, some manufacturers of all-electric vehicles do not market vehicles that can receive AM broadcasts over the air (although AM broadcasts can be heard over digital streaming services, such as Tunein Radio). To date, the Company has not perceived negative economic impact from DARS or Internet-streamed audio on the Company’s full-service stations and FM translators, possibly due, in part, to the possibility of confusion in the digital advertising market, but the Company cannot predict whether there will be future negative economic impact.
In-Band On-Channel “Hybrid Digital” Radio. The FCC’s rules permit radio stations to broadcast using in-band, on-channel (IBOC) technology that allows AM and FM stations to operate using the IBOC system developed by iBiquity Digital Corporation. This technology has become commonly known as “hybrid digital” or HD radio. Stations broadcast the same main channel program material in both analog and digital modes. HD radio technology permits “hybrid” operations, the simultaneous transmission of analog and digital signals with a single AM and FM channel. HD radio technology can provide near CD-quality sound on FM channels and FM quality on AM channels. HD radio technology also permits the transmission of up to four additional program streams over FM stations and one over AM stations (which streams do not count as separate radio stations under the multiple ownership rules.) At the present time, we are configured to broadcast in HD radio on 52 stations. On November 28, 2022, the FCC issued a Public Notice seeking comment on a petition for rulemaking requesting the Commission to adopt an updated formula to determine and increase FM digital sideband power levels for stations transmitting digital FM. On October 28, 2020, the FCC released a Report and Order, in which it adopted rules (effective January 4, 2021) to allow AM radio stations to broadcast an all-digital signal using the HD Radio in-band on-channel (IBOC) mode termed “MA3.” In adopting the new rules, the FCC said that a voluntary conversion to all-digital broadcasting will benefit many AM stations and their listeners by improving reception quality and listenable coverage in stations' service areas. At this time, the Company has not made a decision on whether to convert any of its AM radio stations to all-digital operation.

Use of FM Translators by AM Stations and Digital Program Streams. FM translator stations are relatively low power radio stations (maximum ERP: 250 Watts) that rebroadcast the programs of full-power AM and FM stations on a secondary basis, meaning they must terminate or modify their operation if they cause interference to a full-power station. The FCC permits AM stations to be rebroadcast on FM translator stations in order to improve reception of programs broadcast by AM stations. The Company intends to continue to use some of its existing FM translators in connection with some of its AM stations. The Company is using some of its existing FM translators to rebroadcast HD radio program streams generated by some of its FM stations, which is permitted by the FCC. In a 2015 Report and Order, Revitalization of the AM Service, the FCC announced an opportunity, restricted to AM licensees and permittees, to apply for and receive authorizations to relocate existing FM translator stations within 250 miles for the sole and limited purpose of enhancing their existing service to the public. To implement this policy, the FCC opened “filing windows,” the last one closing October 31, 2016. Some of the Company’s subsidiaries that are AM licensees, acquired FM translators during the filing window, and relocated them to their local markets to pair with some of the Company’s AM broadcast stations. The FM translators so acquired were obligated to rebroadcast the related AM station for at least four years, not counting any periods of silence. The FCC later opened two windows for the filing of applications for construction permits for new FM translators, the final window closing January 31, 2018. In the filing windows, qualifying AM licensees could apply for one, and only one, new FM translator station, in the non-reserved FM band to be used solely to re-broadcast the licensee’s AM signal to provide fill-in and/or nighttime service on a permanent basis. The Company filed applications in both windows and obtained some construction permits as a result. If the Company should decide that a subsidiary should sell or suspend operations of an AM station with such an FM construction permit or license, the subsidiary would also be required to concurrently sell or suspend operations of the FM translator. The FCC has adopted rules regarding FM translator interference (1) allowing FM translators to resolve interference issues by changing channels to any available same-band frequency using a minor modification application; (2) standardizing the information that must be compiled and submitted by a station claiming interference from an FM translator, including a required minimum number of listener complaints; (3) establishing interference complaint resolution procedures; and (4) establishing an outer contour limit (45 dBm) for the affected station within which interference complaints will be considered actionable while providing for a process to waive that limit in special circumstances. Because FM translators are “secondary services,” they could be displaced by full power stations.
​
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, the federal agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, may investigate certain acquisitions. Under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice and to observe specified waiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition. Any decision by the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could affect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt rules that would restrict our ability to acquire additional stations.

Changes to Application and Assignment Procedures. FCC rules  give Native American tribes a priority to obtain broadcast radio licenses in tribal communities. The rules provide an opportunity for tribes to establish new service specifically designed to offer programming that meets the needs of tribal citizens. In addition, the rules modified the FCC’s radio application and assignment procedures, assisting qualified applicants to more rapidly introduce new radio service to the public. These modifications (1) prohibit an AM applicant that obtains a construction permit through a dispositive Section 307(b) preference from downgrading the service level that led to the dispositive preference; (2) require technical proposals for new or major change AM facilities filed with Form 175 (i.e., FCC “short-form” Auction) applications to meet certain minimum technical standards to be eligible for further auction processing; and (3) give FCC operating bureaus authority to cap filing window applications. In 2011, the FCC released its Third Report and Order which limits eligibility for authorizations associated with allotments added to the FM Table of Allotments using the “Tribal Priority” to the tribes whom the Tribal Priority was intended to benefit. In October 2018, the FCC released a “Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” as part of its ongoing effort to assist AM broadcast stations in providing full-time service to their communities. The FCC sought comment on technical proposals to reduce nighttime interference afforded to wide-area “Class A” AM radio stations to enable more local AM stations to increase their nighttime service. The Company has no Class A AM radio stations, but has Class B, Class C and Class D AM radio stations, some of which might benefit if the FCC changes its rules as proposed. In 2018, the FCC issued a Notice of Inquiry on whether to issue an NPRM that could lead to creation of a new Class C4 FM station that would allow use of power of up to 12 kW ERP, but the matter remains pending before the FCC.
The Company pays for the use of music broadcast on its stations by obtaining licenses from organizations called performing rights organizations (“PRO”) (e.g. Broadcast Music, Inc., American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers SESAC, LLC, and Global Music Rights LLC), which, in turn pay composers, authors and publishers for their works. Federal law grants a performance right for sound recordings in favor of recording companies and performing artists for non-interactive digital transmissions and Internet radio. As a result, users of music, including the Company, are required to pay royalties for these uses through Sound Exchange, a non-profit performance rights organization. (Other PROs could be formed, which could increase the royalties we pay.) Periodically, bills have been introduced in Congress, that if passed, would have required the Company to pay additional fees to an organization called MusicFirst which would distribute the money to other entities. Efforts continue by certain organizations to persuade Congress to enact a law that would require such payments. Periodically, bills have been introduced in Congress that, if adopted, would require the Company to pay additional fees to one or more organizations that would distribute the money to performers or other entities. The American Music Fairness Act was introduced on February 2, 2023, in both the Senate and House of Representatives (118th Congress). (A similar Bill died in the 117th Congress.) The Act would require radio stations to have an additional license to publicly perform certain sound recordings. The Copyright Royalty Board would periodically determine the royalty rates for such a license. Terrestrial broadcast stations, and the owners of such stations, that fall below certain revenue thresholds would pay certain flat fees, instead of the board-established rate, for a license.
In late 2018, Congress passed the “Music Modernization Act” which was signed into law by the President. The law (1) improves compensation to songwriters and streamlined how their music is licensed; (2) enables legacy artists (who recorded music before 1972) to be paid royalties when their music is played on digital radio; and (3) provides a consistent legal process for studio professionals, including record producers and engineers to receive royalties for their contributions to music that they help to create. The law creates a blanket license for digital music providers to make permanent downloads, limited downloads, and interactive streams, creates a collective to administer the blanket license, and makes various improvements to royalty rate proceedings. This law could impose an additional financial burden on the Company, but the extent of the burden depends on how the fee payment requirement is structured.

Proposed Changes. The FCC has under consideration, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect us and the operation and ownership of our broadcast properties. Application processing rules adopted by the FCC might require us to apply for facilities modifications to our standard broadcast stations in future “window” periods for filing applications or result in the stations being “locked in” with their present facilities. The FCC is authorized to use auctions for the allocation of radio broadcast spectrum frequencies for commercial use. The implementation of this law could require us to bid for the use of certain frequencies.
