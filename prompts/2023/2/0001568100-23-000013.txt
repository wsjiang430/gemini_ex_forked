Item 1. Business
Overview
PagerDuty is a digital operations management platform that manages urgent and mission-critical work for a modern, digital business. We empower teams to respond rapidly to incidents to resolve or avoid customer issues, reduce noise, predict and avoid performance degradation, improve productivity, and accelerate digital transformation.
Today, nearly every business is a digital business. As such, organizations are under pressure to enhance their digital operations in order to meet escalating customer expectations, resolve incidents proactively, and free-up time for innovation projects. This means critical, time sensitive, and unpredictable work needs to be detected and orchestrated.
We collect data and digital signals from virtually any software-enabled system or device and leverage powerful machine learning to correlate, process, and predict opportunities and issues. Using incident response, event management, and automation, we bring together the right people with the right information so they can resolve issues and act on opportunities in minutes or seconds from wherever they are.
PagerDuty was founded to support the DevOps movement by breaking down silos between technical teams, like developers and operators, enabling a culture of accountability and collaboration. Our platform’s initial focus was on the software developers who are the owners and architects of the customers’ digital experience and enterprises’ digital transformation. To drive adoption and earn trust within the developer community, our platform is designed to find, adopt, and scale with a rapid return on investment (“ROI”) for our users.
Since our founding in 2009, we have expanded our capabilities from a single product focused on on-call management for developers to a multi-product platform that crosses silos into IT operations, security, customer service, and executive stakeholder roles across an organization. We have evolved from an on-call tool into the platform for digital operations, which resides at the center of a company’s technology ecosystem.
We have spent more than a decade building deep product integrations to our platform, and our ecosystem now includes over 700 direct integrations to enable our customers to gather and correlate digital signals from any system or device. This allows technical teams to collect digital signals from any system or platform in their environment, and without the effects of context switching. Those same integrations connect with popular collaboration tools and business applications as well as all types of technology stacks to drive automation of work.
We generate revenue primarily from cloud-hosted subscription fees. We also generate revenue from term-license software subscription fees. We have a land-and-expand business model that leads to viral adoption of our products and subsequent expansion. Our online self-service model is the primary mechanism for landing new customers and enabling teams to get started without assistance. We complement our self-service model with high-velocity inside sales focused on small and medium businesses, a commercial team focused on mid-market customers, and a field sales team focused on enterprise customers. Our mid-market and enterprise customers account for the majority of our revenue today. These teams drive expansion to additional users, new use cases, and add-on products, as well as the upsell to higher value plans.
Our business has experienced rapid growth since our inception. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, our revenue was $370.8 million and $281.4 million, respectively. We continue to invest in our business and had a net loss attributable to PagerDuty of $128.4 million and $107.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Our Platform and Key Customer Benefits
We have invested aggressively in research and development to build innovative products that deliver value to our customers. Our cloud-native platform is differentiated based on a broad range of attributes:
•Built for real time. Our platform manages today’s complex and contemporary digital services. These are hybrid cloud and microservice based environments that are constantly changing state. That requires managing the entire service lifecycle from collecting data, interpreting digital signals, mobilizing a response when needed, and providing insights—all in real time. There is no concept of queued tickets or queued work on our platform because we are built to understand these situations and solve incidents within seconds or minutes, not hours or days.
•Nearly 14 years’ of data from over 15,200 paying customers. As pioneers in digital operations management, we have a rich repository of machine-generated data and human response data. We utilize our data from every incident and leverage it across our platform, allowing us to build advanced machine-learning capabilities, provide richer contextual insights to teams, and share in-depth analytics, benchmarking, and best practices with our customers.
•Over 700 integrations across the technology ecosystem. We have invested extensively in an ecosystem that includes over 700 integrations, allowing us to harness data from software-enabled systems and devices. We have deep integrations to a range of widely used technologies, such as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Datadog, HashiCorp, New Relic, and Splunk, and many bidirectional integrations such as Atlassian, Microsoft VSTS, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Slack. Our integrations support a broad range of use cases including developers, IT, security, customer service and support, and other business functions. We provide capabilities through which our users can easily build integrations themselves and connect our products with other third-party technologies.
•Breadth of functionality. We provide our customers with a complete platform that spans end-to-end digital operations management needs: harness digital data, make sense of data, automate, respond and engage teams, and analyze and learn from a team’s actions. We have continued to extend our core capabilities around on-call management and incident response to include AI Ops and automation. We have embedded machine learning, automation, insights, and best practices across our products to help our customers realize value quickly.
•Proactive. We are leading a shift from efficient response to proactive and predictive action to help teams prevent incidents from occurring.
•Combine process automation and team mobilization. We combine process automation technology with team mobilization to serve up a proposed automation routine to the right responder, with the option to initiate it with the click of a button. This enables tier one responders with easy press-button automation of powerful remediation steps to cut critical minutes out of outages and incidents.
•Secure, resilient, and scalable. Our customers depend on us for their digital operations needs. When their systems fail, we need to be operational. We have built multiple redundancies into our infrastructure, including multiple cloud regions, communications network, and a single DNS provider from a leading cloud provider. We run entirely in production, with no maintenance windows, so our customers can rely on always-on delivery. We have delivered 99.98% uptime to our customers over the past 24 months. Security is a critical customer requirement, and we have adopted governance, access control, and vulnerability testing to support the needs of our most sophisticated customers.
•Designed for the user. Our software is instant on and easy to adopt and use. We provide a simple, self-service onboarding experience so teams can be up and running in minutes. Our products are mobile-first and include intuitive navigation. Customers can easily extend our platform across teams and multiple use cases within an organization.
•Technology agnostic. We are agnostic to our customer’s technology stack and provide them the choice to use the technologies that meet their needs. We are flexible, modular, and open in our approach to building our platform with a powerful API to enable rapid integrations into even the most complex environments. Our open technology and broad range of integrations ensures that we can effectively co-exist with our customer’s technology.
•Enhanced productivity. PagerDuty empowers the full ROI of our customers’ technology stack, using machine learning, automation, auto-remediation, and self-healing to bring together the right people with the right information to generate the appropriate action, in real time, when seconds matter.
The PagerDuty Operations Platform consists of the following products, which empowers teams to address broader digital operations management requirements.
•PagerDuty Incident Response. PagerDuty Incident Response provides a real-time view across the status of a digital service while incorporating noise reduction to remove false positives. Templated, automated runbooks guide major incidents while task automation automates diagnostics and remediation wherever possible. If human intervention is required, it provides advanced incident response capabilities to quickly identify and mobilize the right responders while equipping responders with context, recommendations, and remediation to accelerate resolution of issues. We also keep all users in the loop during an incident, providing templated stakeholder updates as well as PagerDuty Status Pages to communicate with end-users.
•PagerDuty Process Automation. PagerDuty Process Automation products empower users with the ability to create automated workflows and runbooks that span different scripts, tools, APIs, and system commands to safely hand off the knowledge required to use these tools correctly and consistently. With this self-service functionality, organizations can safely extend operations privileges to other teams and business units.
•PagerDuty Event Intelligence. PagerDuty Event Intelligence (“AI Ops”) applies machine learning to correlate and automate the identification of incidents from billions of events. Event Intelligence groups related events into a single incident, performs advanced suppression to prevent notification of non-actionable events, and continuously learns from similar incidents to provide teams better context and insight. Our Event Intelligence capabilities allow teams to reduce manual work and be more productive.
•PagerDuty for Customer Service. PagerDuty for Customer Service makes it easy to orchestrate, automate, and scale your response to customer impacting issues. With real-time data, two-way communication, and a fully integrated tool stack, we provide what our customers need to act as a unit and resolve issues faster. During an incident, customers receive proactive and clear information on service status, resolution activities, and even the ability to escalate, right from within today’s most populated case management platforms.
Our Growth Strategies
•Land new customers. We will continue to target new customers by leveraging our trusted brand and efficient go-to-market strategy that combines self-serve viral adoption with a focused direct sales effort. We will continue to build on our partner ecosystem to drive awareness and adoption of our products. We will continue to target our potential customers with community building and marketing programs that include digital campaigns, our user events, broader industry events, customer marketing activities, and user meet-ups.
•Expand usage within our existing customer base across development, IT operations, security operations, customer service and support, as well as with new user groups such as business and industrial operations. Development and IT professionals often make an initial purchase of our platform for a small number of users and then expand users over time. We will continue to work with customers to demonstrate how additional users can help accelerate organizational benefits. We see significant growth opportunities within the development, IT operations, security operations, and customer service. We intend to increase our inside and field sales and customer success efforts as well as leverage partners to continue to drive adoption across our existing customers.
•Introduce new products and functionality. We will continue to make investments in research and development to bolster our existing products, increase the reach of our integrations, and innovate on our platform. Our expanding portfolio of products provides us additional opportunities to upsell and cross-sell into our customer base. In addition to internal development, we can expand our product portfolio and offerings through acquisitions.
•Grow our international presence. We intend to build on our success to date and grow our sales outside North America, particularly throughout EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Japan. The self-service, low friction nature of our offering allows us to expand our reach into other regions where we see significant opportunity. Our international operations generated 24% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.
Our Market Opportunity
Our platform has demonstrated core use cases across development, IT operations, customer service and support, and security operations. We estimated that in 2022, there were approximately 75 million potential users worldwide in the development, IT operations, customer service and support, and security operations segments, comprised of approximately: 
•25.0 million development personnel
•21.0 million IT operations personnel
•27.0 million customer service and support personnel
•2.0 million security operations personnel
We estimate our total addressable market is over $38 billion. To calculate our total addressable market, we multiply our estimate of 75 million potential users by our applicable product average revenue per user. We believe that we have approximately 1% penetration worldwide within these markets. In addition to our core use cases, we are seeing customers use our platform across their business operations and industrial operations. 
Customer Success
We are committed to the success of our customers. This means delivering performance improvements that enable our customers to drive their digital initiatives. The key to delivering recurring value is rapid implementation with a focus on continuous improvement throughout our relationship. We assist our customers by enhancing their ability to operate in real time via cross functional workflows in engineering, IT, security, customer support, executive leadership, and across their entire employee base.
Companies are typically on a digital operations maturity journey that we model in five stages: manual, reactive, responsive, proactive, and preventative. In our view, the majority of organizations are in one of the first three stages, which means issues are primarily discovered only through customer reports. 
To assist companies in the advancement of their digital journeys, our Customer Success team is structured to provide expertise through the entire customer lifecycle from onboarding, adoption of our platform, business value realization and renewal. We provide in-depth instructor-led courses to certify our customers and partners on products, technology, and best practices. The support teams respond to our customers’ queries related to our products via a multi-channel environment from no-fee to paid 24/7 support with service-level agreements. Technical industry experts, architects, and consultants assist customers with rapid deployment with workflow optimization and PagerDuty best practices. The renewals team works proactively to reduce churn/downgrade and provide customers with a positive on-time renewal experience.
Research and Development
Our research and development team consists of our user experience, product management, engineering and technical operations teams. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing, delivery and support 
of new and existing technologies and features for our platform. They are also responsible for scaling our platform and improving our cloud infrastructure and ultimately, our high availability. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market. Our distributed research and development efforts enable us to attract the best talent across our multiple locations, including San Francisco, Atlanta, Toronto, and Lisbon as well as fully remote workers not located near our hubs.
Sales and Marketing
We employ a highly efficient go-to-market strategy that combines viral adoption through word of mouth, user-centric content marketing, and grass roots brand development with a high-velocity inside sales model that drives both the initial land of new customers and the subsequent expansion into broader use cases, increased users, and premium functionality. We also target senior IT and business operations management at companies from mid-market to the largest enterprises through inside and field sales strategies to pursue larger-scale deployments.
Our global sales teams focus on both new customer acquisition and up-selling and cross-selling additional products to our existing customers. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Japan, as well as by target organization size.
Our core Incident Response and Customer Service Operations products offer pricing plans aligned with our customers’ needs and the maturity of their digital operations: Free, Professional, Business, and Digital Operations. Customers may begin their journey on the PagerDuty platform with the Free plan for less than 5 users and grow into full Digital Operations capabilities, streamlining incident response, automating diagnosis and remediation. Status Pages is available as an add-on to these Plans to enhance and automate the end-user engagement in managing an incident. AI Ops add-ons, PagerDuty Event Intelligence and PagerDuty Automation Actions, are also available for a more incremental upgrade as an alternative to upgrading to the full Digital Operations plan. Customers can also take an automation first approach, beginning their PagerDuty journey with subscriptions to PagerDuty Process Automation (previously Rundeck) or its SaaS counterpart, PagerDuty Runbook Automation. 
We use diverse marketing tactics to engage with prospective customers, including email marketing, event marketing, digital advertising, social media, public relations, and community initiatives. We also host and present at regional, national, and global events, including our PagerDuty Summit, to engage both customers and prospects, deliver product training, share best practices, and foster community. Our technical leaders and evangelists frequently speak as subject matter experts at market-leading developer events like DevOps Days.
Competition
PagerDuty has largely competed to replace manual work and homegrown systems. Most commercial competition for the Developer market has been against OpsGenie, xMatters and Splunk On-Call (formerly VictorOps), as well as a long-tail of vendors within niche customer, geography or use-case segments. 
In larger Enterprise customers and particularly when engaging key Central Ops Teams and CIO / IT buying centers, we also commonly encounter ServiceNow via their bundled Notify solution and Information Technology Operations Management suite. Over time, our competitive landscape is shifting from point-product to multi-solution and platform competition. 
We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including:
•platform functionality and breadth of offering;
•integrations;
•performance, security, scalability, and reliability;
•real-time response, workflow, and automation capabilities;
•focus on modern, contemporary digital services and operations;
•brand recognition, reputation, and customer satisfaction;
•ease of implementation and ease of use, and;
•time-to-value, total cost of ownership, and return on investment.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors and that we are well positioned as a leader in the category of digital operations management.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. While we had 15 issued patents and 13 patent applications pending examination in the United States as of January 31, 2023 that, with respect to the issued patents, are expected to have terms ending between 2033 and 2040, and we actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one or more of our patents. We pursue the registration of domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.
We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. We require our employees, consultants, and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation, and other proprietary information. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and trademarks, as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new modules, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Regulatory
We are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. These laws and regulations may involve privacy, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection, export taxation, or other subjects. Many of the laws and regulations to which we are subject are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations often are uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate. Because global laws and regulations have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law or regulation. For a discussion of risks related to these various areas of government regulation, see “Risk Factors—We are subject to evolving and increasingly stringent U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other legal obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; adverse publicity and reputational damage; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; decrease the price of our common stock; and other adverse business consequences.
Geographic Information
For a description of our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic location, see Note 15, “Geographic Information” of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
Human Capital
Our corporate culture is a critical component of our success and we will continue taking steps to help foster innovation, teamwork, diversity, and inclusion. We promote an environment that values the democratization of ideas and the adoption of a DevOps culture internally, resulting in a mindset that is empowering our team to be more innovative, productive, and collaborative. We are continually investing in our global workforce to further drive diversity and inclusion, provide fair and market-competitive pay and benefits to support our employees’ well-being, and foster their growth and development. As of January 31, 2023, we had 1,166 employees, of which approximately 65% were in the United States and 35% were in our international locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity
Our vision is to build an equitable world where we transform critical work so all teams can delight their customers and build trust. We seek to enable employees of all backgrounds to be champions, facilitators, and practitioners of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (“ID&E”) everywhere. Regardless of identity, it is important that all our employees feel welcome, safe, and heard. Our ID&E mission—to activate the potential of all PagerDuty employees, or Dutonians, through systemic and programmatic equity, sustainable community development and impactful learning experiences. Our ID&E vision is a people-first, data-driven organization where power is equitably distributed across the mosaic of our employees’ identities. 
As we work to meet our diversity goals, it is important that every employee feels accepted, supported, and able to be their authentic self. We do this by creating initiatives to invest in equitable and sustainable communities, which help employees mobilize and take action. Our goal is for PagerDuty to be a people-first organization where opportunity is equitably distributed among all employees. Our Employee Resource Groups (“ERG”)—networks of employees with shared characteristics, interests, and experiences—are a critical element in how we achieve this goal and engage with employees. The ERGs are the cultural backbone of our vibrant community and support our ID&E efforts through education, awareness, and celebration. Additional components of our strategy include an ID&E Ambassador Program, which provides a global perspective on cultural and business norms for every region, and ID&E Guiding Principles to promote model leadership across all levels.
Additional information on our diversity and inclusion strategy, and diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at https://www.pagerduty.com/careers/diversity/. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well Being
We offer equitable, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being and attract and retain high performing talent. We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefits to ensure we are providing a package that is competitive with a constantly changing market, as well as meets the needs of our employees. Aligned with our company strategy and objectives, our compensation programs include fixed base pay and opportunities for short-term and long-term incentives for those eligible. We offer a wide selection of benefits including, but not limited to, medical, dental, and vision benefits, flexible spending and health savings accounts, generous paid time-off and leave programs, and retirement plans. We also provide emotional well-being services through our Employee Assistance Program and a variety of other behavioral health support applications.
Employee Engagement and Development
We are deeply committed and invested in ensuring our employees are provided with the resources and tools to not only thrive at PagerDuty, but to work better together as a distributed global company. With the recent forming of our Culture & Strategy team, our mission is to increase employee engagement throughout the entire employee lifecycle through intentional listening, activating our company values and practice, and communicating our employee value proposition to employees, customers and partners. Through different methods of listening, such as our quarterly Engagement surveys, we gather specific feedback on drivers of engagement to better create an engaging and equitable experience for all Dutonians. Our People Development team equips our leaders with the coaching and training necessary to have conversations with our employees to empower them to own and drive their career development goals. These two teams work together to provide a holistic experience where our employees feel 
engaged and connected to our company's goals, as well as seeing themselves growing and developing within our organization.
Social Impact and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Initiatives
We launched PagerDuty.org in 2018 to ensure a sustainable contribution to the communities in which we live, work, and serve by integrating social impact and ESG goals across our business. PagerDuty.org exists to empower those working to make a difference in the world, and to use our technology to help solve intractable challenges. We do so by mobilizing core company assets to help impact organizations deliver on their mission when every moment matters, by deploying high-impact funding that enables partners to advance justice and equitable health outcomes, and by activating employees to create meaningful impact.
A Pledge 1% member since 2017, we commit 1% of equity, 1% of product, and 1% of employee time to advance positive community impact. In June 2018, we fulfilled our equity pledge by issuing a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock to the Tides Foundation to fund our philanthropic giving. The PagerDuty.org Fund works to meet urgent needs faster to advance justice and health through integrated investments of grants, donated product, and employee expertise in our core areas of Time-Critical Health and Climate Just. We deployed approximately $1.4 million in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, including the launch of the PagerDuty Impact Accelerator to help tech-forward organizations in our focus areas of time-critical health and climate equity amplify their impact by providing unrestricted funding, product credits and discounts, technical pro bono support, and voice amplification. We also focus on addressing community inequities in another area impacted by structural racism—the effects of climate change and environmental pollution. Through our Climate Equity portfolio, we made investments in community-based approaches to climate equity (inclusive of Earth Guardians, Earth Hacks, OpenAQ and The Solutions Project). Further, we continue to empower PagerDuty Employee Resource Groups and global champions to fund organizations and issues aligned to their community through our Dutonian-led grantmaking program. 
Our volunteer time off policy offers employees 20 hours annually to volunteer, vote, and participate in non-partisan voter engagement efforts and peaceful demonstration. Beginning with new hires, our rewards and recognition programs honor and celebrate the contributions employees make in giving their time, expertise, or capital. Ninety-five percent of our employees participated in volunteering or giving back in 2022.
We made our foundational investments in ESG in 2020, including forming a cross-functional ESG Steering Committee of business leadership, to ensure that how we operate as a business produces positive impact. In 2021 we strengthened this work, conducting our first materiality assessment and first two years of greenhouse gas inventories. We garnered a silver rating by EcoVadis and incorporated ESG oversight into the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our board of directors (the “Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee”). In 2022, we hired a dedicated ESG director, released our first ESG disclosures, and maintained our silver rating by EcoVadis. We also signaled our commitment to the carbon budgets laid out in the Paris Accord and are preparing science-based targets to meet these commitments. This work continues to be overseen by the ESG Steering Committee, our chief financial officer as ESG Executive Sponsor, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
To articulate our progress against social impact, equity, and ESG goals and commitments, PagerDuty.org publishes an annual Impact Report. We track and report annually on our progress on social impact, equity and ESG commitments as we formalize new areas of investment in social impact, ID&E, and ESG.
