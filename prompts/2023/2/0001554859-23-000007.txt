ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
General
We are a company providing technology solutions to improve the clinical effectiveness and efficiency of healthcare providers. Our mission is to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services that assist our customers in evaluating and treating chronic diseases. Our patented and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, cleared product, QuantaFlo, measures arterial blood flow in the extremities to aid in the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, and serves as an aid to measure hemodynamics related to heart dysfunction. 

We have an agreement with Mellitus Health, Inc, or Mellitus, a private company to exclusively market and distribute Insulin Insights, an FDA-cleared software product that recommends optimal insulin dosing for diabetic outpatients in the United States, including Puerto Rico, except for selected accounts. 
We have also made cash investments in Mellitus, in Monarch Medical Technology, LLC, or Monarch, a privately-held digital health company whose proprietary product, EndoTool Glucose Management System, or EndoTool, offers a technology-enabled approach to inpatient glycemic management, and in NeuroDiagnostics Inc., a privately-held company that is doing business as SYNAPS Dx, or SYNAPS, whose product, Discern, is a test for early Alzheimer’s disease. We continue to develop additional complementary proprietary products in-house (such as our recently released QuantaFlo extension as an aid to measure hemodynamics related to heart dysfunction), and seek out other arrangements for additional products and services that we believe will bring value to our customers and to our company. We believe our current products and services, and any future products or services that we may offer, position us to provide valuable information to our customer base, which in turn permits them to better guide patient care.
In the year ended December 31, 2022, we had total revenues of $56.7 million and net income of $14.3 million compared to total revenues of $53.0 million and net income of $17.2 million in 2021. 
Our Products and Services
We currently market a patented and FDA-cleared, cardiac and vascular testing product, QuantaFlo, to our customers, who include insurance plans, physician groups, risk assessment groups, hospitals and retailers. We also have an exclusive distribution arrangement for the United States, including Puerto Rico, to distribute Insulin Insights, an FDA-cleared, software solution designed to provide insulin dosing recommendations to clinicians for the adjustment and maintenance of blood glucose levels in insulin-dependent patients with Type 2 diabetes. We believe this product will be attractive to our existing customers as well as help expand our customer base.

QuantaFlo
QuantaFlo is a four-minute in-office blood flow test. Healthcare providers can use blood flow measurements as part of their examinations of a patient’s vascular condition, including assessments of patients who have vascular disease. The following diagram illustrates the use of QuantaFlo:

QuantaFlo features a sensor clamp that is placed on the toe or finger. Infrared light emitted from the clamp on the dorsal surface of the digit is scattered and reflected by the red blood cells coursing through the area of illumination. Returning light is ‘sensed’ by the sensor. A blood flow waveform is instantaneously constructed by our proprietary software algorithm. Both index fingers and both large toes are interrogated, which takes about 30 seconds for each. The product may be used with provocative maneuvers.
We have primarily developed a license model rather than an outright sales model for QuantaFlo. This license model eliminates the need to make a capital equipment sale. Consequently, we generally require no down payment or long-term commitment from our customers. QuantaFlo has an expected average lifetime of at least three years. To date, we roughly estimate that routine office usage of the QuantaFlo has ranged from a few tests per week up to 10 tests per day. We also offer contracts in which we invoice on a per test basis for use of QuantaFlo. Approximately 62% of our customers are on the fixed-fee software licensing model, whereas 38% are on the variable fee model based on usage.
We have placed our QuantaFlo product with healthcare insurance plans, integrated delivery networks, independent physician groups, hospitals and companies contracting with the healthcare industry such as risk assessment groups and retailers in addition to doctors’ offices. Our two largest customers are U.S. diversified healthcare companies and affiliated plans, and in the year ended December 31, 2022, they accounted for 40.4% and 29.0% of our revenues, respectively, compared to 40.8% and 28.6%, respectively, in the prior year.

Other Blood Flow Testing Methods
Blood flow is the amount of blood delivered to a given region per unit time, whereas blood pressure is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of arteries. Given a fixed resistance, blood flow and blood pressure are proportional. The ABI with Doppler test uses a blood pressure cuff to measure the systolic blood pressure in the lower legs and in the arms. A blood pressure cuff is inflated proximal to the artery in question. Using a Doppler device, the inflation continues until the pulse in the artery ceases. The blood pressure cuff is then slowly deflated. When the artery’s pulse is re-detected through the Doppler probe the pressure in the cuff at that moment indicates the systolic pressure of that artery. The test is repeated on all four extremities. Well-established criteria for the ratio of the blood pressure in a leg compared to the blood pressure in the arms are used to assess the presence or absence of flow obstruction. Generally, these tests take 15 minutes to perform and require a vascular technician to be done properly. Like QuantaFlo, the traditional analog ABI test with Doppler is a non-invasive physiologic measurement that may be abnormal in the presence of PAD. Alternatively, primary care physicians may palpate the pedal pulses to assess blood flow in the lower extremities. However, pulse palpation is generally not sensitive for the detection of vascular disease. Other options to detect arterial obstructions or hemodynamic problems are imaging systems that use ultrasound, x-ray technology or magnetic resonance to obtain anatomic information about blood vessels in the legs. However, as compared to QuantaFlo, imaging tests are much more expensive, time consuming and are performed by specialists in special laboratories or offices.
Insulin Insights
​
Insulin Insights is a software program that is used by a healthcare provider to optimize outpatient insulin dosing. In April 2021, we entered into an agreement with Mellitus to exclusively market and distribute this software program in the United States, including Puerto Rico, except for selected accounts. Under this agreement and its December 2022 amendment, we have pre-paid for an aggregate of $2.5 million of licenses ($2.0 million in April 2021 and $0.5 million in December 2022).
​
We currently are distributing Insulin Insights using a software as a service, or SaaS, license model on a per patient per month fee rather than an outright sales model. We generally require no down payment or long-term commitment from our customers. We intend to reevaluate the price periodically. As we have only recently deployed Insulin Insights with customers, we do not have enough experience with the product to be able estimate routine usage of Insulin Insights in terms of patients per location.
We seek to distribute Insulin Insights to healthcare insurance plans, integrated delivery networks, independent physician groups, and companies that contract with the healthcare industry, such as risk assessment groups, long-term care, or remote patient monitoring organizations, in addition to doctors’ offices. We believe that this software product will be of interest to our existing customer base, as well as help us to expand interest in QuantaFlo to additional customers.

Market Opportunity
 ​
QuantaFlo
Fee-for-service is a payment model where services are unbundled and paid for separately. In health care, it gives an incentive for physicians to provide more treatments because payment is dependent on the quantity of care, rather than quality of care. Capitation is a payment arrangement that pays a physician or group of physicians a set amount for each enrolled person assigned to them, per period of time, whether or not that person seeks care. The amount of remuneration is based on the average expected healthcare utilization of that patient, with greater payment for patients with significant medical history. For Medicare Advantage patients CMS pays a fee per patient, also known as capitation. CMS uses risk adjustment to adjust capitation payments to health plans, either higher or lower, to account for the differences in expected health costs of individuals. Accordingly, under CMS guidelines, risk factor adjustments per patient will provide payment that is higher for sicker patients who have conditions that are codified.
​

The current coding system used by CMS for the Medicare Advantage program is a hierarchical condition category, or HCC, diagnostic classification system that began by classifying over 14,000 diagnosis codes into approximately 1,500 diagnostic groups, or DXGs. Each code maps to exactly one DXG, which represents a well-specified medical condition, such as DXG 96.01 pre-cerebral or cerebral arterial occlusion with infarction. DXGs are further aggregated into 204 condition categories, or CCs. CCs describe a broader set of similar diseases. Diseases within a CC are related clinically and with respect to cost. An example is CC100 Ischemic or Unspecified Stroke, which includes DXG 95.02 iatrogenic cerebrovascular infarction or hemorrhage (e.g., postoperative stroke), DXG 96.01 precerebral or cerebral arterial occlusion with infarction, DXG 96.02 acute but ill-defined cerebrovascular disease (ICD-9), and DXG 170.59 neonatal cerebral infarction.
​
Undiagnosed cardiac and vascular diseases are major under-diagnosed health problems in the United States. These conditions are common and deadly cardiovascular disease is often undiagnosed. As with clogged arteries in the heart, clogged arteries in the legs place patients at an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Published studies have shown that persons with PAD are four times more likely to die of heart attack, and two to three times more likely to die of stroke. According to a study by P.G. Steg published in the JAMA, patients with PAD have a 21% event rate of cardiovascular death, heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular hospitalization within 12 months. The SAGE Group has estimated that as many as 20 million people are affected with PAD in the United States alone and A.T. Hirsch et al. in a JAMA published article further estimate that only 11% have claudication (pain on exertion), a classic symptom of PAD.
The spectrum of heart dysfunction includes heart failure. Published studies have shown that there are over one million hospitalizations per year in the United States from heart failure and the annual cost of care exceeds $30 billion. According to a study published in AHA Journals by S.L. Jackson, et al, heart failure affects ~approximately 6.5 million adults in the United States and the lifetime risk of heart failure is estimated to be one in five at 40 years of age. The study also notes persons with heart failure have mortality rates 20% to 25% higher after hospitalization within one year after diagnosis.
​
Many people affected with cardiac and vascular diseases do not have noticeable symptoms. When symptoms are present, they often include fatigue, heaviness, cramping or pain during activity, leg or foot pain, sores, wounds or ulcers on the toes, feet, or legs, which are slow to heal, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, or enlarged liver. Persons with cardiac and vascular diseases may become disabled and not be able to work. 
​
Risk factors for developing cardiac and vascular diseases include: 
​

• | Age (over 50 years)
--+--------------------

​

• | Race (African-American)
--+------------------------

​

• | History of smoking
--+-------------------

​

• | Diabetes
--+---------

​

• | High blood pressure
--+--------------------

​

• | High blood cholesterol
--+-----------------------

​

• | Personal history of vascular disease, heart attack, or stroke.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

​
We believe medical personnel and insurance plans who care for those older than 50 years are the target market for QuantaFlo. Based on U.S. Census data, we believe there are more than 80 million older Americans who could be evaluated for the presence of cardiac and vascular diseases. 
​
There are over 400,000 medical professionals practicing primary care in the United States. In addition, based on American Heart Association data, there are over 20,000 cardiologists and 7,500 vascular and cardiovascular surgeons. Also, there are millions of diabetic patients seen routinely by endocrinologists. Many podiatrists who see patients with these problems and orthopedic surgeons may see value in screening patients for circulation issues prior to leg 

7



procedures. Neurologists may need a tool to differentiate leg pain from vascular versus neurologic etiology. Nephrologists see patients with kidney disease, who have a higher frequency of cardiac and vascular diseases. Wound care centers need to know the adequacy of limb perfusion. We expect that each physician will have many patient visits annually from people older than 50 years. While it is standard practice to ask about symptoms of cardiac and vascular diseases and to look for signs on physical exam, we believe that it is often the case in busy practices that the questions go unasked. 
​
Generally speaking, individual products are not specifically approved by name under a third-party payor code. Physicians who seek reimbursement for testing procedures are likely to use codes that describe non-invasive physiologic testing. We do not track directly how physicians code for and receive payment for such procedures.
 ​
Insulin Insights
​
Of the growing diabetic population in the United States, over a quarter use insulin according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Insulin is a necessary medication as nearly all Type 1 diabetics (approximately 1.6 million people in the United States, and roughly 21% of Type 2 diabetics (of the over 30 million people in the United States with Type 2 diabetics) must also use insulin to bring their blood glucose levels down to a healthy range. Without insulin, patients are likely to suffer from blurred vision, weight loss, and intolerable thirst. Eventually, uncontrolled diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney failure, gangrene, loss of limbs, and ultimately death. Tighter control of glucose is proven to improve the outcomes in diabetes care.
​
In the United States, about 90% of diabetic patients treating with insulin are managed by primary care practitioners. Insulin Insights is designed to be used by such practitioners to recommend optimal insulin dosing for each individual patient.
​
CMS has established a star rating system to measure and report on the quality of health services received by consumers in Medicare Advantage plans. Based on the star ratings, high performing health plans are also eligible to be paid bonuses by CMS. Among measures factored into plans’ star ratings are measures assessing diabetes care, including a measure adapted from the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) that assesses the percentage of diabetic plan enrollees aged 18-75 who demonstrate good blood sugar control (HbA1c <9.0%). We believe this provides a financial incentive to potential customers for an Insulin Insights software license, as it will assist them in working with their diabetic patients to optimize insulin dosing and achieve better control of their blood glucose levels. 
​
Other Products and Services
In addition to our internal research and development efforts, in October 2020, we invested in SYNAPS, whose product, Discern, is a test for early Alzheimer’s disease. In December 2022, we purchased a senior secured convertible promissory note of Monarch, maker of EndoTool, a technology-enabled approach to inpatient glycemic management. We do not have a distribution agreement for Discern or EndoTool.
Strategy
Our mission is to develop, manufacture and market products and services that assist healthcare providers in evaluating and treating chronic diseases. We intend to do this by:

● | Targeting customers with patients at risk of developing cardiac and vascular diseases. Healthcare providers use blood flow measurements as part of their assessment of a patient’s cardiac and vascular condition. Our strategy is to keep marketing QuantaFlo on a recurrent revenue model to insurance plans and medical personnel who care for those older than 50 years, including cardiologists, internists, nephrologists, endocrinologist, podiatrists, and family practitioners. Specifically, we believe there are more than 400,000 physicians and other potential customers in the United States alone, many of whom care for patients will be more than 50 years old and at increased risk of developing cardiac and vascular diseases. Based on U.S. Census data, the evaluable patient population for QuantaFlo is estimated to be more than 80 million patients in the United States annually.

● | Expanding the tools available to internists and non-peripheral vascular experts. Our intention is to provide a tool to internists and non-cardiovascular experts, for whom it was previously impractical to conduct a blood flow measurement unless in a specialized vascular laboratory. For cardiovascular specialists, QuantaFlo does not require the use of blood pressure cuffs (which should not be used on some breast cancer patients), and measures without blood pressure in obese patients and patients with non-compressible, hard, calcified arteries. Currently, these patients often are unable to be measured satisfactorily with traditional devices.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing additional product and service offerings that allow healthcare providers to deliver cost-effective wellness and receive increased compensation for their services. In March 2015, we received FDA 510(k) clearance of our product, QuantaFlo, reflecting several updates and modifications to the original model that were developed in conjunction with our consultant engineering groups. We recently began marketing QuantaFlo as an aid to measure hemodynamics related to heart dysfunction and continue to explore potential new product and service offerings through our research and development programs. Our goal is to provide cost-effective wellness solutions for our growing, established customer base, achieve a reputation for outstanding service, all while leveraging our gains in the marketplace for such product and service offerings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exploring additional product and service offerings through arrangements or potential acquisitions. In addition to our in-house research and development efforts, we are also seeking out opportunities to expand our product and service offerings through marketing, distribution and licensing arrangements, such as our agreement to exclusively market and distribute Insulin Insights line in the United States, including Puerto Rico. Such arrangements will allow us to sell products related to chronic disease management through our network of physicians and other customers. We may also consider opportunistically acquiring additional products if we believe they fit within our strategy.

Sales and Marketing
We provide our QuantaFlo product to our customers through our salespersons, who have experience selling products and services to our anticipated market.
We deliver our QuantaFlo testing product directly to our customers, and in-service training to the customers is provided either on-line or in person. Because QuantaFlo is relatively easy to use, training can generally be accomplished in less than one day.
Customers who have licensed our QuantaFlo product may pay by credit card or check generally on the 15th of each month as an advance for usage during the next 30 days. In some cases, customers prefer an annual license paid in advance. We provide technical support daily, coupled directly to the manufacturing operation so that replacement products, if needed, can be shipped overnight directly to the customer. The majority of the support is over the telephone and focuses on software and connectivity issues, rather than hardware. We upgrade QuantaFlo operating systems as appropriate by direct shipments or electronically.
In addition to the license model with a fixed monthly fee, we also have contracts that charge a variable monthly fee, in which we invoice based on the number of tests performed with QuantaFlo. In addition to licensing the QuantaFlo software, we have sold QuantaFlo equipment and accessories.
We have an agreement with Mellitus to exclusively market and distribute Insulin Insights, a new software product, in the United States, including Puerto Rico, except for selected accounts. Under this April 2021 agreement as amended in December 2022, we pre-paid for an aggregate $2.5 million of licenses ($2.0 million in April 2021 and $0.5 million in December 2022. We signed several customers to a license for this product in late 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had not generated any material revenues from this product.
Manufacturing
We manufacture our product, QuantaFlo, in the United States through independent contractors whom we pay for finished goods. Our contracts provide for subassemblies, product final assembly, test, serialization, finished goods, 

9



inventory and shipping operations. Our current contracts will remain in force until terminated by us upon three months written notice, or until terminated by either party for cause. Although we believe we have a good working relationship with our current contract manufacturers, there are many such qualified contract manufacturers available around the country should we need to replace them or if they are not able to meet demand as we grow our business as anticipated. While our current independent contract manufacturers source some supplies from China, we believe QuantaFlo is relatively easy to manufacture, and should we encounter issues due to supply chain disruptions as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other global supply chain constraints, we believe alternative sources should be available. We employ a consultant vendor qualification expert to monitor and test the quality controls and quality assurance procedures of our contract manufacturer.
Competition
The principal competitor for QuantaFlo is the standard blood pressure cuff ABI device. QuantaFlo does not include a blood pressure cuff. There are several companies that manufacture the traditional ABI device, which range in price from $2,500 to $20,000. Some of these companies are much larger than us and have more financial resources and their own distributor network. The traditional ABI devices are differentiated by the degree of automation designed into each product. ABI devices that rely more heavily on operator assessment (i.e., listening to the return of pulse while decreasing cuff pressure), are thought to have less objectivity in their measurement. Because standard ABI devices require a better trained operator, the products are usually sold to specialized vascular labs that are supervised by a vascular surgeon, with the tests performed by a licensed vascular technician. It is not uncommon for such ABI devices to be marketed to the offices of internists, podiatrists, endocrinologists or most cardiologists.
Our intention is to provide a tool to internists and non-cardiovascular experts, for whom it was previously impractical to conduct a blood flow measurement unless in a specialized vascular laboratory. For cardiovascular specialists, QuantaFlo does not require the use of blood pressure cuffs (which should not be used on some breast cancer patients), and measures without blood pressure in obese patients and patients with non-compressible, hard, calcified arteries. Currently, these patients often are unable to be measured with traditional devices.
Competitors are beginning to market competing digital devices seeking to provide fast results that may be used outside of a specialized vascular laboratory. Given the potential size of the market, we expect competitors to continue to enter the space.
Research and Development Program
We have dedicated engineering consultants that are well integrated into our overall business, ranging from customer requirements to technical support. The engineering group uses our in-house quality system as its framework for new product development and release. The majority of the engineering is circuit design and software development. We are currently developing several updates and modifications to QuantaFlo in conjunction with our consultant engineering groups, as well as exploring potential new product and service offerings. These product and service offerings are being designed to provide cost-effective wellness solutions for our growing, established customer base. The new products and service offerings under development or that may be developed may incorporate some of our current technology or new technology. We are also directing much of our activity to building our trade secrets and protecting proprietary positions.
Clinical Experience
Several studies of our blood flow measurement products have been conducted by our customers or authors facilitated by access to our database. Other studies were conducted by our customers using their own independently generated datasets.
One of these studies, the results of which were compiled in 2012 and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2013, sought to determine the frequency of finding undiscovered vascular disease in primary care practices using our vascular testing product. In the study of 632 patients at 19 office practices, the frequency of flow obstruction was 12% and of these patients, 75% did not have classic symptoms of PAD. Among other limitations of the study, the publication 

10



mentioned the study’s retrospective design, no direct comparison to other vascular tests and passive data collection such that 8% of patients had one or more missing data fields.
Another study was designed to assess the side-by-side performance of our vascular testing product compared with traditional analog ABI with Doppler measurements in medical practices. In the study of 181 limbs from 121 patients at 5 medical practices during 2012 and 2013, three techniques were used on all limbs: our test, traditional analog ABI with Doppler, and Duplex ultrasound imaging as a gold standard. Traditional analog ABI with Doppler was unable to perform a conclusive study in 8.7% of limbs. In the remaining limbs, our vascular testing product and the ABI with Doppler measurements were in agreement, or in other words concordant, in 78% of limbs. Among the discordant limbs, Duplex imaging judged that the true positive rate of our vascular testing product was significantly higher than that of ABI with Doppler by a 2 to 1 margin. The results of the study are available as a white paper that may be shown to potential customers or other interested parties. Among other limitations of the study, the study had a small sample size, was conducted at specialty practices not primary care practices, had a retrospective design with incomplete collection of demographic information and clinical characteristics of the population, was not peer reviewed and was not peer reviewed.
Another study also was designed to assess the side-by-side performance of our vascular testing product compared with traditional analog ABI with Doppler measurements in medical practices. In this prospective study at five medical practices during 2013 through 2015, 360 limbs from 180 patients were examined with three techniques: Our vascular testing product, traditional analog ABI with Doppler, and Duplex ultrasound imaging as a gold standard. Results demonstrated that our test demonstrated greater sensitivity, greater accuracy and equivalent specificity compared to ABI with Doppler measurements. The results of the study are available as a white paper. Among limitations of the study are that it had a small sample size, was conducted at a mix of primary care and specialty practices, had no formal tracking of consecutive patients, and was not peer reviewed.
Another study, the results of which were compiled and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2018, reported an analysis of a registry of screening PAD testing with our product between January 2017 and July 2017. In this study, 226,565 patients were tested and 31.3% had moderate to severe flow impairment in the lower extremities. Further analysis of a subset of 26,459 patients for whom clinical characteristics were recorded showed that 95% were asymptomatic. The authors concluded that earlier recognition of PAD may lead to earlier secondary preventive measures and improved outcomes for a population with a high-risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Among other limitations of the study, the publication mentioned the study’s retrospective design and that clinical factors were recorded for only approximately 10% of patients. 
A retrospective case series compiled and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2018 reported on 48 patients that were tested with our product and subsequently had a contrast angiography procedure for clinical indications. Using contrast angiography as the gold standard for determining PAD, the author concluded the data supports the use of our product as an aid for practicing physicians to accurately diagnose PAD in combination with clinical judgment. Among other limitations of the study, the sample size was small, tests were performed at specialty centers, and the analysis was done retrospectively.
Certain racial and economic groups in the United States are underserved by the medical community with limited access to specialists, a lack of early detection programs and inadequate preventive disease management. There is abundant evidence that certain ethnic populations are more at risk for cardiovascular disease and suffer sequelae of untreated PAD. A study was compiled and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2018 that presented a retrospective analysis of 1,901 patients tested with our product at 22 medical practices that serve predominately lower-income, non-white populations. The author concluded that our product can be effectively utilized by primary care clinicians in poor and underserved communities to identify PAD. The author posited that identifying PAD earlier in the disease process can be an important step towards filling the unmet need of higher intensity vascular care for minority populations. Limitations of the study include that it was a retrospective analysis and that there was no protocol to unveil the identity or ethnicity of any of the individual patients.
Women may lack early detection programs and have inadequate preventive disease management. A study was compiled and published in a peer reviewed journal in 2019 that presented a retrospective analysis of 68,402 female 

11



patients tested with our product at primary care medical practices in the United States. The author concluded that our product was an efficient means to aid in the diagnosis of PAD in vulnerable women who are currently underserved by their health care providers. Limitations of the study include that it was a retrospective analysis with self-reporting of clinical characteristics.
A February 2022 published peer-reviewed study analyzed screening tests using QuantaFlo for undetected and asymptomatic heart failure in a Medicare Advantage population between January 2016 and December 2016. In this study, 13,971 patients were tested and 31.6% had a positive result for PAD. Almost 60% had lower socio-economic income level with 15.1% living under the poverty level. The risk associated with detecting PAD was substantial with a 60-70% increased risk of all-cause mortality or morbidity at one year and a 40-50% increased risk of all-cause mortality or morbidity at three years. The risk was not modified by a history of coronary or cerebrovascular artery disease. The authors concluded that these findings highlight an enormous potential to realize cost-savings by reducing cardiovascular event rates and deploying population-based PAD risk mitigation strategies. Among other limitations of the study, the publication mentioned that they were not able to study the potential impact of PAD risk management strategies used after a positive PAD screen was communicated with the primary care provider and patient. This may have led to an underestimation of the true risk as targeted PAD risk management and behavior modification strategies may have been initiated at the discretion of the provider and patient.
A September 2022 a peer-reviewed study under real-world conditions, illustrating the benefits of PAD in-home screening was published. The study analyzed screening tests using QuantaFlo for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries aged ≥65 years participating in the Optum HouseCalls program in the U.S. between April 1, 2017 and February 1, 2019. Of the 192,500 patients tested in their homes, 27.7% had a positive result for PAD. One-year all-cause mortality, 1- and 2-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and major adverse limb events (MALE) in the PAD positive patients were all significantly increased versus those patients who screened negative for PAD (p <.001). Moreover, the severity of the test results was associated with worse outcomes. The authors stated, “Detecting previously undiagnosed peripheral artery disease is a way to risk stratify a population that would benefit from further cardiovascular risk management.” Among other limitations of the study, the publication mentioned that the findings are only generalizable to individuals aged ≥65 years and the study could not assess the proportion of deaths due to cardiovascular causes.
A February 2023 a peer-reviewed study was published assessing the accuracy our vascular testing product using cardiac echocardiography (Echo) as a gold standard of heart failure. Results were that our test showed a significant correlation with Echo (p<.01). Among other limitations of the study, the publication mentioned that data on severity were not including and outcomes following preventative measures were not studied.

FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
To commercially distribute QuantaFlo or any future medical device we develop requires or will require either prior 510(k) clearance or prior approval of a pre-market approval, or PMA, application or de novo classification from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission for commercial distribution. This process is known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement. Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to FDA’s “general controls”, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events and malfunctions through the submission of Medical Device Reports, or MDRs, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to FDA’s general controls and any other “special controls” deemed necessary by FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as performance standards, product-specific guidance documents, special labeling requirements, patient registries or post-market surveillance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device are placed in class III, requiring approval of a PMA application. To market low to moderate risk devices that are automatically placed into class III, a manufacturer may request a de novo classification from FDA. Both pre-market clearance, PMA applications and de novo classification requests are subject to the payment of user fees, paid at the time of submission for FDA review. The FDA can also impose restrictions on the sale, distribution or use of devices at the time of their clearance or approval or authorization, or subsequent to marketing.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a medical device manufacturer must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a PMA application or a device that has been reclassified from class III to class II or class I. A device is substantially equivalent if, with respect to the predicate device, it has the same intended use and has either (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) different technological characteristics, but the information provided in the 510(k) submission demonstrates that the device does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness and is at least as safe and effective as the predicate device. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the notification is submitted, but it can take significantly longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing pre-market notification, the FDA may request additional information, including 

13



clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new pre-market submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained.
Pre-market Approval Pathway
A PMA application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) clearance process and requires proof of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited to, technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, data and manufacturing and labeling to support the FDA’s determination that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. After FDA determines that a PMA application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also, during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, which impose elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or PMA application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
De Novo Classification Pathway
Device types that the FDA has not previously classified as class I, II or III are automatically classified into class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. To market low to moderate risk devices that are automatically placed into class III due to the absence of a predicate device, a manufacturer may request a de novo classification. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into class III to request classification of its device into class I or II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. A device may be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent or a manufacturer may request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. The FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo classification request, although in practice, the FDA’s review may take significantly longer. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. The FDA may reject the de novo classification request if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. In the event FDA determines the data and information submitted demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, FDA will grant the de novo request for classification. When FDA grants a de novo request for classification, the device is granted marketing authorization and further can serve as a predicate for future devices of that type through a 510(k) premarket notification.

14



Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA and often for a de novo classification request, and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption, or IDE, regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational devices, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibility of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must be approved prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, purported or represented to be used in supporting or sustaining human life, is for a use that is substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A clinical trial may begin 30 days after receipt of the IDE application by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will approve the IDE and, if it is approved, the FDA may or may not determine that the date derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an institutional review board, or IRB, for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA.
If the device is considered a “non-significant risk,” an IDE application to the FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the IRB overseeing the investigation at each clinical trial site is required. Abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements also apply to non-significant risk device studies.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all applicable reporting and record keeping requirements. 
Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical study will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant marketing clearance or approval. Information about certain device clinical trials must be posted on clinicaltrials.gov.

Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation
After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or pre-market pathway, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:

● | establishment registration and device listings with the FDA;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | QSR, which require manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, i.e., “off-label,” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, that may present a risk to health; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements to conduct post-market surveillance studies to establish continued safety data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:

● | untitled letters or warning letters;
--+-------------------------------------


● | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------


● | recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval or de novo classification of new products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing pre-market approvals that are already granted or reclassifying the devices; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

We are subject to unannounced device inspections by the FDA and the California Food and Drug Branch. These inspections may include our suppliers’ facilities.
Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement
We cannot control whether or not providers who use QuantaFlo will seek third-party coverage for such procedures or reimbursement. If providers intend to seek third-party coverage or reimbursement for use of QuantaFlo, the success of our product could become dependent on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, such as governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. Reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure, coverage of the codes by the third-party payors and adequate payment for the resources used.

16



Physician coding for procedures is established by the American Medical Association. CMS, the agency responsible for administering Medicare and Medicaid, and the National Center for Health Statistics, are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by hospitals for reporting inpatient procedures, and many private payors use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. All physician and hospital coding is subject to change, which could impact coverage and reimbursement and physician practice behavior. We do not track denial of requests for reimbursement made by the users of QuantaFlo. It is our belief that such denials have occurred and might occur in the future with more or less frequency. We are not in the business of performing QuantaFlo measurements that require us to seek reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers, including those that offer Medicare Advantage plans, and managed care programs. Many of our customers are third-party payors who pay us directly for use of our product and services.
Independent of the coding status, third-party payors may deny coverage based on their own criteria, such as if they believe that the clinical efficacy of a device or procedure is not well established and is deemed experimental or investigational, is not the most cost-effective treatment available, or is used for an unapproved indication. We will continue to provide the appropriate resources to patients, physicians, hospitals and insurers in order to promote the best in patient care and clarity regarding reimbursement and work to obtain appropriate coverage policies. For some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, coverage and reimbursement differ from state to state, and some state Medicaid programs may not pay an adequate amount for the procedures performed with our products, if any payment is made at all. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicaid continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. National and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior. For example, if CMS decreases the monthly payment for a 65-year-old patient, then the provider will have to decide which steps to eliminate from his or her routine office visits in order to maintain a profitable business model. If the time of an office visit will need to be reduced to maintain a profitable business, a provider may decide to eliminate certain services or conducting certain procedures, such as deciding not to use a thermometer, take someone’s blood pressure or use a QuantaFlo to run an ABI test. Thus, reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS on providers may affect their decision making about which services to provide during an office visit, which could affect our company.
Particularly in the United States, third-party payors carefully review, have undertaken cost-containment initiatives, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures and medical products as well as any technology that they, in their own judgment, consider experimental or investigational. In addition, an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval or pre-authorization of the services that a member will receive. Many managed care programs are paying their providers on a capitated basis, which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying them a predetermined amount per member per month. The percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the United States over the next decade.
There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payor coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse
Our operations may be subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations including fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, data privacy and security laws and transparency laws related to payments and/or other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals.
The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded healthcare programs, such as remuneration provided to physicians to induce them to use certain tissue products or medical devices reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. The federal Anti-Kickback Law is subject to evolving interpretations. For example, the government has enforced the federal Anti-Kickback Law to reach large 

17



settlements with healthcare companies based on, among other things, inappropriate consultant arrangements with physicians or questionable joint venture arrangements. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Further, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes.
Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. The federal government is using the civil False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices and has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements in addition to individual criminal convictions. In addition, off-label promotion has been pursued as a violation of the federal False Claims Act. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although physicians are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA based on their independent medical judgment, we are prohibited from promoting products for such off-label uses. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and suppliers’ compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws.
Additionally, the majority of states in which we market our products have similar fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback, false claims, anti-fee splitting and self-referral laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and violations may result in substantial civil, criminal and administrative penalties.
The Health Care Reform Law also included the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires device manufacturers for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to disclose annually to CMS any “transfer of value” made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other licensed health care practitioners, and teaching hospitals. Such information is now made publicly available in a searchable format, and device manufacturers are now required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Additionally, the commercial compliance environment is continually evolving in the healthcare industry as some states, including California, Massachusetts and Vermont, mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, along with the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply in multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.
Our business operations may also be subject to certain federal and state laws regarding the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, which impose obligations on certain entities with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.
To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to an unprecedented level of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming. Additionally, if a healthcare company settles an investigation with the DOJ or other law 

18



enforcement agencies, the company may be required to agree to additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement.
The U.S. and foreign government regulators have increased regulation, enforcement, inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry, including increased U.S. government oversight and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Whenever a governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, that authority can impose fines, delay or suspend regulatory clearances, institute proceedings to detain or seize our products, issue a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees and can recommend criminal prosecution. Moreover, governmental authorities can ban or request the recall, repair, replacement or refund of the cost of devices we distribute.
If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe penalties including, for example, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid, additional reporting obligations and oversight if subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and the results of our operations.
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for QuantaFlo or what actions foreign, federal, state or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation.
Healthcare Reform
Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. For example, the Health Care Reform Law significantly changed the health care industry and brought a new way of doing business for providers and health insurance plans.
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law. For example, several executive orders were issued along with other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the Health Care Reform Law. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the Health Care Reform Law. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the Health Care Reform Law such as removing penalties, effective January 1, 2019, for not complying with the Health Care Reform Law’s “individual mandate” to carry health insurance, delaying the implementation of certain Health Care Reform Law-mandated fees, and repealing the medical device excise tax. In June 2021, in an appeal from a lower court decision holding that the individual mandate under the Health Care Reform Law is unconstitutional, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the law as they had not alleged personal injury traceable to the allegedly unlawful conduct. As a result, the Supreme Court did not rule on the constitutionality of the Health Care Reform Law. In January 2021, an executive order was issued to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Health Care Reform Law marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Health Care Reform Law. It is unclear how additional litigation or executive orders will impact the Health Care Reform Law and our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since Health Care Reform Law. For example, through the process created by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent legislation, there are automatic reductions of Medicare payments to providers of generally 2% per fiscal year; these reductions went into effect in April 

19



2013 and except for a period of temporary relief that was afforded in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency will remain in effect through fiscal year 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to cost-containment initiatives within the health care industry. We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other global pandemics.
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2022, we had 127 employees, all of which were full-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be positive. We also regularly engage consultants and subcontractors on an as-needed basis. We increased our head count in the fiscal year 2022 from 124 to 127, which represents a 2% increase from the prior year. As we grow our business, we expect to continue to experience growth in the number of our employees, particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, and distribution. 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. We use different incentive plans such as annual cash bonuses, no-cost healthcare for employees and their families, paid vacation and generous referral bonuses to attract, retain and motivate our employees.
Governance and Culture - Our board of directors, including committees thereof, and executive management team are actively involved in overseeing our employee-related strategies and practices as well as our company culture. Our director of human resources and her team are also actively involved in implementing these decisions. We believe our company culture has been a critical component of our success in attracting and retaining personnel.
Diversity and Inclusion - We aim to create an inclusive working environment where all employees are respected and treated equally. We value diversity of backgrounds and perspectives and our policy is that we do not discriminate based on race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, military and veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristics established by federal, state or local laws. This message is emphasized from the top of our organization down to all of our employees. 
Health, Safety and Well-Being - The safety and well-being of our employees is critical to our successful operation. Our health and safety activities are overseen by our board of directors, executive management team and director of human resources. Most of our employees work remotely, with the exception of a few employees who work in the office. These employees are generally in fulfillment and sales support roles. Our human resources department coordinates on-line training programs with the help of outside consultants. We believe that this model of training better fits our business operations and needs.
Response to COVID-19
As a virtual company, we believe we were better prepared than many at home offices to deal with the effects of the global spread of the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of governmental restrictions mandating “shelter-in-place” or similar limitations, which at the time resulted in our sales personnel eliminating travel, we increased the use of our on-line platforms and created new means to replace training methods and hands-on interactions with the customers that we relied on pre-pandemic. To date, we have not terminated any of our employees due to the pandemic. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation and, if needed, will evolve our plans and policies to keep our employees and customers safe.
