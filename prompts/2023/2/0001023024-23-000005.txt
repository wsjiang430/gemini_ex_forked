Item 1. Business
ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (together, “ANI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a diversified bio-pharmaceutical company serving patients in need by developing, manufacturing, and marketing high quality branded and generic prescription pharmaceuticals, including for diseases with high unmet medical need. Our team is focused on delivering growth by building a successful Purified Cortrophin Gel franchise, strengthening our generics business with enhanced development capability, innovation in established brands and leveraging our manufacturing capabilities. Our four current pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, of which two are located in Baudette, Minnesota, one is located in East Windsor, New Jersey, and one is located in Oakville, Ontario, are together capable of producing oral solid dose products, as well as semi-solids, liquids and topicals, controlled substances, and potent products that must be manufactured in a fully-contained environment. On June 2, 2022, we announced that we intend to cease operations at our Oakville, Ontario, Canada manufacturing plant by first quarter 2023. This action is part of ongoing initiatives to capture operational synergies following our acquisition of Novitium Pharma LLC (“Novitium”) in November 2021. We have transitioned the majority of products manufactured or packaged in Oakville to one of our three U.S.-based manufacturing sites and are on track to cease operations by the end of the first quarter 2023. We are seeking to find potential buyers for the Oakville site.
​
Through research and development, acquisitions of businesses, acquisitions of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”), New Drug Applications (“NDAs”), product rights, and entry into agreements to obtain the distribution rights for various products, we have a commercial portfolio of 111 products with a wide variety of indications and a robust portfolio of pipeline products as of December 31, 2022. Refer to our website at www.anipharmaceuticals.com for information on our products, including indications/treatments.
​
On November 19, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Novitium. With operations in East Windsor, New Jersey, and Chennai, India, Novitium is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in development, manufacturing, and distribution of niche generic products. Founded in 2016, Novitium has since developed a growing commercial product portfolio spanning a diverse range of dosage forms and therapeutic categories. 
Unless otherwise required by the context, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in April 2001. Our principal executive offices are located at 210 Main Street West, Baudette, Minnesota, 56623, our telephone number is (218) 634-3500, and our website address is www.anipharmaceuticals.com.
Strategy
Our objective is to build a sustainable and growing biopharmaceutical company serving patients in need and creating long-term value for our investors. Our growth strategy is driven by the following key growth drivers:
Building a successful Rare Disease platform
We have spent significant time, effort and resources in establishing our Rare Disease platform. We acquired the NDAs for Cortrophin gel and Cortrophin-Zinc in January 2016 and executed long-term supply agreements with a supplier of our primary raw material for corticotrophin active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”), a supplier of corticotrophin API with whom we have advanced the manufacture of commercial scale batches of API, and a Cortrophin gel fill/finish contract manufacturer. During the second quarter of 2021, we submitted a Supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) to the FDA.
On October 29, 2021, the FDA approved the Company’s sNDA for Purified Cortrophin Gel (Repository Corticotropin Injection USP) for the treatment of certain chronic autoimmune disorders, including acute exacerbations of 

3



multiple sclerosis (“MS”) and rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), in addition to excess urinary protein due to nephrotic syndrome. Cortrophin Gel is an adrenocorticotropic hormone (“ACTH”), also known as purified corticotropin.
​
During 2021 and 2022, we invested in leadership, expertise and infrastructure in the areas of commercialization of rare disease therapies and developed a launch strategy and commercial plan for this product. During 2021 and throughout 2022, we hired a significant number of new employees and assembled and trained our Rare Disease field force. On January 24, 2022, we announced the commercial launch of Cortrophin Gel in the U.S as our foundational Rare Disease asset. As a result of the build out of our Rare Disease team, our expenditures in support of these efforts were significantly higher in 2022 as compared to 2021. 
We plan to continue to invest behind Cortrophin Gel and our Rare Disease platform in 2023 and beyond. 
Strengthening our Generics, Established Brands, and Other segment through continued investment in our generic research and development capability and increased focus on niche opportunities
​
We have grown our generics business through a combination of market share gains on existing products and new product launches. We have also successfully acquired numerous ANDAs through business and asset acquisitions. Our most recent business acquisition was Novitium, including its portfolio of commercial and pipeline generic products, manufacturing and development facilities and expert workforce. The Novitium acquisition significantly increased our generic pharmaceutical research and development and manufacturing capabilities. We have begun to increase our focus on niche lower competition opportunities such as injectables, Paragraph IV, and Competitive Generic Therapy designation filings. Additionally, we will continue to seek opportunities to enhance our capabilities through strategic partnerships and acquisitions of assets and businesses. On July 21, 2022, we completed an asset acquisition of four ANDAs from Oakrum Pharma, including two that were commercial at the time of acquisition. 
​
We have grown our established brand product offerings through acquisition. We have acquired the NDAs for and market Atacand, Atacand HCT, Arimidex, Casodex, Lithobid, Vancocin, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, Oxistat, Veregen, and Pandel. We are innovating in our go-to-market strategy through creative partnerships. 
​
Our overall strategy is enabled by an empowered, collaborative, and purposeful team with a high performance-orientation. 
Generic Product Development Considerations
We consider a variety of criteria in determining which products to develop, all of which influence the level of competition upon product launch. These criteria include:

● | Formulation Complexity. Our development and manufacturing capabilities enable us to manufacture pharmaceuticals that are difficult to produce, including highly potent, extended release, combination, and low dosage products. This ability to manufacture a variety of complex products is a competitive strength that we intend to leverage in selecting products to develop or manufacture.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patent Status. We seek to develop products whose branded bioequivalents do not have long-term patent protection or existing patent challenges.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Market Size. When determining whether to develop or acquire an individual product, we review the current and expected market size for that product at launch, as well as forecasted price erosion upon conversion from branded to generic pricing. We endeavor to manufacture products with sufficient market size to enable us to enter the market with a strong likelihood of being able to price our products both competitively and at a profit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Profit Potential. We research the availability and cost of active pharmaceutical ingredients in determining which products to develop or acquire. In determining the potential profit of a product, we forecast our
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4




anticipated market share, pricing, including the expected price erosion caused by competition from other generic manufacturers, and the estimated cost to manufacture the products.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manufacturing. We generally seek to develop and manufacture products at our own manufacturing plants in order to optimize the utilization of our facilities, ensure quality control in our products, and to more closely control the economic inputs and outputs of our products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competition. When determining whether to develop or acquire a product, we research existing and expected competition. We seek to develop products for which we can obtain sufficient market share and may decline to develop a product if we anticipate significant competition. Our specialized manufacturing facilities provide a means of entering niche markets, such as hormone therapies, in which fewer generic companies are able to compete.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to laboratories that support the requirements of raw material, finished product, and stability testing, we have a 1,000-square foot pilot laboratory offering liquid, suspension and solid dose development capabilities. This pilot laboratory offers a full range of analytical capabilities, including method development, validation and de-formulation, and is licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”). Finally, a separate development suite located within our high-potency manufacturing facility offers additional capabilities for product development.
We also lease a 968-square foot industrial space in Chennai, India where we perform research and development activities. 
Products and Markets
Products
A complete list of our generic and branded pharmaceutical products and descriptions is posted on our website, www.anipharmaceuticals.com. 
Markets 
In determining which products to pursue for development, we target products that are complex to manufacture and therefore have higher barriers to entry. These factors provide opportunities for growth, utilizing our competitive strengths at the same time that they decrease the number of potential competitors in the markets for these products. These markets currently include controlled substances, oncology products, hormones and steroids, injectables, and complex formulations, including extended release and combination products.
Controlled Substances
Schedule II controlled substances are drugs considered to have a high abuse risk but that also have safe and accepted medical uses. In addition to our Schedule II products currently on the market, our pipeline includes ANDAs in this market. One of our manufacturing facilities in Baudette, Minnesota and our manufacturing facility in East Windsor, New Jersey is licensed by the DEA for the manufacture of Schedule II controlled substances. 
Oncology Products
Due to the capabilities of our containment facility and our expertise in manufacturing segregation, we are focused on developing and manufacturing niche oncology products (anti-cancer). In particular, we are targeting products subject to priority review by the FDA, more specifically those with no blocking patents and no generic competition. We currently have a variety of oncology products on the market.

5



Hormone and Steroid Drugs
The market for hormone and steroid drugs includes hormone therapy to alleviate menopausal symptoms in women, contraceptives, testosterone replacement therapies for men, and therapies for treating hormone-sensitive cancers.
Hormone Therapy (“HT”) has been a long-accepted medical treatment for alleviating the symptoms of menopause. Initially, HT consisted of estrogen only but has evolved to include combination therapies of estrogen, progesterone, and androgens. We target niche products in the HT and steroid product market for several reasons, including:

● | Hormone and steroid products are a core competency based on our manufacturing and product development teams’ long history of manufacturing these types of products; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The aging “baby boomer” population, of which women represent a majority, is expected to support continued growth in the HT market.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Injectables
Our burgeoning injectable portfolio contains injectable ANDA products encompassing several key therapeutic areas. Cortrophin Gel is our first branded injectable product. We work with world-class manufacturing partners to support these efforts. 
Complex Formulations
We have a range of complex formulation products currently on the market and a pipeline that includes various extended-release products and combination products.
Competitive Generic Therapy
The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, or (“FDARA”), created a new pathway by which FDA may, at the request of the applicant, designate a drug with “inadequate generic competition” as a competitive generic therapy (“CGT”). At the request of the applicant, the FDA may also expedite the review of an ANDA for a drug designated as a CGT. Under the CGT pathway, the FDA provides a statutory provision for a 180-day exclusivity period for certain first to market applicants whose ANDA received a CGT designation. Our Novitium subsidiary has developed a strong track record of obtaining CGT approvals and we expect to continue to develop generic drugs under the CGT pathway.
Contract Manufacturing
We manufacture pharmaceutical products for several branded and generic companies, who outsource production in order to:

● | Free-up internal resources to focus on sales and marketing as well as research and development;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employ internal capacity to manufacture higher volume or more critical products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilize our specialized equipment and expertise.
--+-------------------------------------------------

We currently anticipate that revenues from contract manufacturing arrangements will begin to decline as we focus our efforts on Rare Disease and leveraging our generic R&D and manufacturing platform for ANI labeled products. 
In conjunction with our acquisitions of WellSpring and Novitium, we acquired WellSpring’s and Novitium’s pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. As a result of these transactions, we perform contract manufacturing in our Baudette, Minnesota and East Windsor, New Jersey facilities. On June 2, 2022, we announced that we intend to cease operations at our Oakville, Ontario, Canada manufacturing plant by first quarter 2023. This action is part of ongoing initiatives to capture operational synergies following our acquisition of Novitium in November 2021. We have 

6



transitioned the majority of products manufactured or packaged in Oakville to one of our three U.S.-based manufacturing sites and are on track to cease operations by the end of the first quarter 2023. 
Manufacturing, Suppliers, and Raw Materials
We require a supply of quality raw materials, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), and components to manufacture and package our pharmaceutical products. In order to manufacture certain of our products deemed controlled substances, we must submit a request to the DEA for a quota to purchase the amount of API needed for manufacture. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers.
We source the raw materials for our products from both domestic and international suppliers, which we carefully select. Generally, we qualify only a single source of API for use in each product due to the cost and time required to validate and qualify a second source of supply. Any change in one of our API suppliers must usually be approved through a Prior Approval Supplement (“PAS”) by the FDA. The process of obtaining an approval of such a PAS can require between four and 18 months. While we also generally qualify a single source for non-API raw materials, the process required to qualify an alternative source of a non-API raw material is typically much less rigorous. If we were to change the supplier of a raw material for a product, the cost for the material could be greater than the amount we paid with the previous supplier. Changes in suppliers are rare but could occur as a result of a supplier’s business failing, an issue arising from an FDA inspection, or failure to maintain our required standards of quality. As a result, we selectively choose suppliers based on various factors including quality, reliability of supply, and long-term financial stability. 
Certain of the APIs for our drug products, including those that are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs, are sourced from international suppliers. From time to time, we have experienced temporary disruptions in the supply of certain of such imported API due to FDA inspections and customs delays. In addition, certain of our products are manufactured, packaged, or manufactured and packaged by third parties.
Government Regulation
The pharmaceutical industry in the U.S. and Canada is highly regulated by multiple U.S. and Canadian government agencies, such as the FDA, the DEA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and Health Canada. As a result, we are subject to extensive and complex rules and regulations, which are subject to revision from time to time. While we have experience with these regulations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully comply with all applicable regulations.
Branded and Generic Pharmaceutical Products
All prescription pharmaceutical products distributed in the U.S., whether branded or generic, must be approved by the FDA. All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling, and quality control. Information to support the bioequivalence of generic drug products or the safety and effectiveness of new drug products for their intended use is also required to be submitted. There are generally two types of applications used for obtaining FDA approval of new products:
New Drug Application (“NDA”)—An NDA is filed when approval is sought to market a newly developed branded product and, in certain instances, for a new dosage form, a new delivery system, or a new indication for an approved drug. 
Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”)—An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug approved under an NDA. 
The ANDA development process is generally less time-consuming and less complex than the NDA development process. It typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the branded drug approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, 

7



typically requires one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved reference listed drug (“RLD”).
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) provides that generic drugs may enter the market after the approval of an ANDA, which requires (1) that bioequivalence to the branded product be demonstrated through clinical studies, and (2) either the expiration, invalidation or circumvention of any patents or the end of any other relevant market exclusivity periods related to the branded drug.
Accordingly, generic products generally provide a safe, effective, and cost-efficient alternative to users of branded products. Growth in the generic pharmaceutical industry has been driven by the increased market acceptance of generic drugs, as well as the number of branded drugs for which patent terms and/or other market exclusivities have expired.
Generic products are generally commercialized after the expiration of patent protection for the branded product and after the end of a period of non-patent market exclusivity. In addition to patent exclusivity, the holder of the NDA may be entitled to a period of non-patent market exclusivity, during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a generic product. Also, if the NDA is a new chemical entity (“NCE”), the FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product for up to five years following approval of the NDA for the NCE. If an NDA is not an NCE, but the holder of the NDA conducted clinical trials essential to approval of the NDA or a supplement thereto, the FDA may not approve a generic equivalent to the NDA for three years. Certain other periods of exclusivity may be available if the branded drug is indicated for treatment of a rare disease or is studied for pediatric indications.
In order to obtain FDA approval of NDAs and ANDAs, our manufacturing procedures and operations must conform to FDA requirements and guidelines, generally referred to as “cGMP.” The requirements for FDA approval encompass all aspects of the production process, including validation and recordkeeping, the standards around which are continuously changing and evolving. As a result, we must consistently monitor and comply with these changes.
Our facilities, procedures, operations, and testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA, the DEA, and other authorities. In addition, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with cGMP and other FDA regulations. Our suppliers are subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.
Post-approval Requirements
After FDA approval of an NDA or ANDA product is obtained, there are many post-approval requirements that must be met. These include registering the manufacturing establishment and listing the product with the FDA, reporting and keeping records of any adverse reactions or production problems, providing updated safety and efficacy information to the agency, and complying with advertising and promotional labeling regulations. Additionally, FDA may approve an NDA with post-marketing study requirements, meaning that additional clinical trials must be conducted after approval in order to further monitor the drug’s safety and efficacy.
The FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) for any product they approve. A REMS is designed to ensure that a drug's benefits outweigh its risks, and may include elements such as medication guides, patient package inserts, communication plans to educate healthcare providers of the product's risks, patient registries, or limitations on who can prescribe or dispense it. A REMS imposes numerous compliance obligations on the NDA and ANDA manufacturers. 
The FDA regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Manufacturers must adhere to strict guidelines when promoting their products; all statements regarding a product must be consistent with its approved labeling and truthful in nature. Additionally, manufacturers may only promote their product for approved indications outlined by the FDA. Physicians may prescribe drugs or biologics off-label but manufacturers cannot promote such uses unless they have been previously authorized by the FDA. All claims made about a product should also be adequately substantiated with evidence of both benefits and risks associated with use in order to ensure fair balance between them.

8



The Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) regulates the distribution of a manufacturer’s prescription drug samples and requires a compliance program governing the storage, security, distribution and recordkeeping of samples, as well as monitoring for loss or theft. The Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”) requires manufacturers and their trading partners, such as repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, and third-party logistics providers, to implement product tracking and tracing technology at the package level to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.
Controlled Substances
The DEA regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, pursuant to the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). Certain of our products contain significant components that are classified as controlled substances. CSA and DEA regulations impose specific requirements on manufacturers and other entities that handle these substances including registration, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, security, and distribution. Recordkeeping requirements include accounting for the amount of product received, manufactured, stored, and distributed. Companies handling controlled substances also are required to maintain adequate security and to report suspicious orders, thefts, and significant losses. The DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to comply with current and future regulations of the DEA could lead to a variety of sanctions, including revocation or denial of renewal of DEA registrations, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
In addition, we must submit a request to the DEA for a quota to purchase the amount of API needed to manufacture certain of our products deemed controlled substances. Without approved quotas from the DEA, we would not be able to purchase these ingredients from our suppliers. As a result, we are dependent upon the DEA to approve quotas large enough to support our continued manufacture of our controlled substances at commercial level. See “Risk Factors ― We are entirely dependent on periodic approval by the DEA for the supply of the API needed to manufacture our controlled substances. An inability to obtain such approvals would reduce or eliminate our revenues for our controlled substances, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results. In addition, we are subject to strict regulation by the DEA and are subject to sanctions if we are unable to comply with related regulatory requirements.”
Unapproved Products
Two of our products, EEMT and Opium Tincture, are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs. The FDA's policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products appears in the FDA's September 2011 Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 440.100 titled “Marketed New Drugs without Approved NDAs or ANDAs.” Under this policy, the FDA has stated that it will follow a risk-based approach with regard to enforcement against marketing of unapproved products. The FDA evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case-by-case basis, but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories, such as those with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness. We continue to believe that, so long as we comply with applicable manufacturing standards, the FDA will continue to operate on a risk-based approach and will not take action against us. However, we can offer no assurance that the FDA will continue to follow this approach or that it will not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products. See “Risk Factors – Two of our products, which together comprised less than 10% of our total revenue in 2022, are marketed without approved NDAs or ANDAs and we can offer no assurances that the FDA will not require us to either seek approval for these products or withdraw them from the market. In either case, our business, financial position, and operating results could be materially adversely affected.”
Medicaid/Medicare
Medicaid and Medicare, both of which are U.S. federal health care programs administered by CMS, are major payors of pharmaceutical products, including those we produce.
Medicaid is administered by the states and jointly funded by the federal and state governments. Its focus is on low-income populations. State drug coverage policies under Medicaid may vary significantly state by state. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), as amended by the Health Care and Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010, together known as the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), originally required states to expand their Medicaid 

9



programs to individuals with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Although the United States Supreme Court in 2011 made the Medicaid expansion optional, many states have expanded their Medicaid programs.
The ACA also made changes to Medicaid law that has negatively impacted our business. Pharmaceutical manufacturers that want their drug products covered by state Medicaid programs must enter into a rebate agreement with CMS and pay rebates to state Medicaid agencies on utilization of their drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. The ACA raised the rebate percentages for both generic and branded pharmaceuticals effective January 1, 2010. The basic rebate is currently 13% of the average manufacturer price for sales of Medicaid-reimbursed products marketed under ANDAs. Sales of Medicaid-reimbursed products marketed under NDAs require manufacturers to rebate the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price or the difference between the average manufacturer price and the “best price” (as defined in the Medicaid statute) during a specific period. In addition, there is an additional rebate if the average manufacturer price of the drug is rising faster than inflation. Federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to the Medicaid program.
Medicare is run by the federal government and is largely focused on the elderly and disabled. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) created Medicare Part D to provide voluntary prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA has increased the amount of reimbursement for pharmaceuticals, a trend that we believe will continue to benefit the generic pharmaceutical industry. The ACA made some changes to Part D to make it easier for Medicare beneficiaries to obtain drugs, such as reducing coinsurance amounts. The ACA also required pharmaceutical companies to provide discounts to Medicare Part D beneficiaries for the cost of branded prescription drugs. The ACA created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or BBA, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D. Under the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program, any pharmaceutical product marketed under an NDA, regardless of whether the product is marketed as a “generic,” is subject to the discount requirement. Our Candesartan Hydrochlorothiazide, Fenofibrate, Fluvoxamine, Hydrocortisone Enema, Lithium Carbonate ER, Mesalamine, Propranolol ER, Terbutaline, and Vancomycin products, while marketed as “generics,” are sold under approved NDAs and, therefore, are subject to the discount requirement. 
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, administrative, executive and Congressional legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the ACA is currently subject to a broad legal challenge in California vs. Azar before the U.S. Supreme Court. Additionally, in November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar, which challenges the constitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA, except for the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect. Were the Supreme Court to invalidate the ACA, that could have far-reaching consequences of an uncertain nature for our industry. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape has both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the industry.
Most of our products are covered by Medicaid and Medicare. Our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any determination that we have failed to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions, and we could be subject to federal or state false claims litigation.
There has also been recent heightened federal governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, a recent Presidential administration released a “Blueprint”, or plan, to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products 

10



paid by consumers. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a requirement on manufacturers to negotiate drug prices with Medicare, beginning in 2026, with negotiated prices subject to a cap. The negotiation provision focuses on single-source drugs and biologics that represent the highest Medicare expenditure, while orphan drugs and certain other drugs are exempt. Also, certain drugs with price increases that outpace inflation will become subject to additional rebates. Under Medicare Part B, the rebate will first be due with respect to Q1 2023, and applies to single-source drugs and biologicals, including biosimilars. Under Medicare Part D, the rebate will first be due with respect to the period from October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023, and applies to brand drugs and generics that are the sole drug on the market. The law’s expansion of inflation-based rebates in the Medicare Part B and D space, and changes to the coverage gap discount program, will further complicate pricing strategies, particularly as to the launch of new products.
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
We own the trademark names for most of our branded products, including Apexicon, Cortenema, Purified Cortrophin Gel, Cortrophin-Zinc, Inderal LA, Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, Lithobid, Reglan, Vancocin, and Veregen. We license the trademark names for Atacand, Atacand HCT, Arimidex, Casodex, Oxistat, and Pandel. With the exception of a license for patent technology for Inderal XL, InnoPran XL, and Veregen, we do not own or license any patents associated with these products. Further, patent protection and market exclusivity for these branded products have expired, with the exception of the Veregen product, which has three patents. One patent expired in 2022 and the remaining two patents expire in 2025 and 2026. Therefore, we consider the trademark names to be of material value and we act to protect these rights from infringement. However, our business is not dependent upon any single trademark. Trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used, and in other countries, as long as registered. Registration is for fixed terms and may be renewed indefinitely. We believe that sales of our branded products have benefited and will continue to benefit from the value of the product name. 
We formerly received royalties from a license for patent rights initially owned by Cell Genesys, Inc., which merged with BioSante in 2009. The royalties were received as a result of sales and milestones related to the Yescarta® product. These royalties ceased after a final payment in 2021. See Note 1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
Distribution Agreements
In addition to selling products under our own NDAs and ANDAs, we enter into marketing and distribution agreements with third parties in which we sell products under ANDAs or NDAs owned or licensed by these third parties. These products are sold under our own label.
Customers
Our customers purchase and distribute our products. Our products are sold by three major retail pharmacy chains: CVS, Rite Aid, and Walgreens. Our customers include five major national wholesalers: AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, McKesson, Smith Drug Company, and Morris Dickson. In addition, our customers include national mail order houses, including CVS Caremark, Humana, and ExpressScripts, as well as group purchasing organizations.

In recent years, the wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation, which has increased the concentration of our wholesale customers. In addition, the number of retail market chains and, in particular, the number of independent drug stores and small chains, has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred, also increasing the concentration of our retail customers. As a result of this trend toward consolidation, a smaller number of companies each control a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 59% of our net revenues were attributable to three wholesalers: AmerisourceBergen Corporation, 26%, McKesson Corporation, 18%, and Cardinal Health, Inc., 15%. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, McKesson Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc., and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, together accounted for approximately 68% and 74% of our net revenues, respectively. In addition, as noted below, our customers also distribute our products. The loss of any of these customers, including in their role as distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Due to a strategic partnership between Amerisource Bergen and Walgreens, Amerisource Bergen handles product distribution for Walgreens. Similarly, Cardinal Health and CVS established a partnership in which Cardinal performs some product distribution for CVS. McKesson also entered into a strategic alliance with both Wal-Mart and Rite Aid. As a result of these strategic partnerships between wholesalers and pharmacy chains, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increases in net sales to the wholesalers, with corresponding decreases in net sales to the pharmacy chains.
In the rare disease business there is a limited distribution network and a select group of specialty pharmacies which can dispense product to appropriate patients. We are in the process of contracting with largest health insurance payers across the appropriate channels and classes of trade.  
​
Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date. Generally, product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Critical Accounting Estimates” for a discussion of our accruals for chargebacks, rebates, returns, and other allowances.

Competition
Certain of our products face limited competition due to complexities in formulation, active pharmaceutical ingredient sourcing, materials handling and manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles. Nevertheless, we compete with numerous other pharmaceutical companies, including large, global pharmaceutical manufacturers capable of addressing these complexities and hurdles with respect to products that we currently produce and products that are in our pipeline. In addition, our products are subject to competition from other generic products and non-prescription alternative therapies.
Our established brand pharmaceutical products currently face competition from generic products and we expect them to continue to face competition from generic products in the future. In order to launch a generic product, a manufacturer must apply to the FDA for an ANDA showing that the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD. (See “Government Regulation.”)
The primary means of competition among generic drug manufacturers are pricing, contract terms, service levels, and reliability. To compete effectively, we seek to consistently produce high-quality, reliable, and effective products. We also establish active working relationships with each of our customers, continually gather important market information in order to respond successfully to requests for proposals, maintain sufficient inventories to assure high service levels, and work to reduce product costs by sourcing and qualifying alternative suppliers whenever possible.
Over the past several years, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced significant consolidation, particularly in distribution channels and among generic and brand drug companies.
The wholesale distributor network for pharmaceutical products has been subject to increasing consolidation, which has increased the concentration of our wholesale customers. In addition, the number of retail market chains and, in particular, the number of independent drug stores and small chains, has decreased as retail consolidation has occurred, also increasing the concentration of our retail customers. As a result of this trend toward consolidation, a smaller number of companies each control a larger share of pharmaceutical distribution channels, which results in pricing pressure on our business and can result in a shift in sales to our competitors.
In addition, consolidation among pharmaceutical companies has created opportunities by reducing the number of competitors. However, as competitors grow larger through consolidation, so do their resources. Larger competitors may be able to aggressively decrease prices in order to gain market share on certain products and may have resources that would allow them to market their products more effectively to potential customers.
Our sales can also be impacted by new studies that indicate that a competitor’s product has greater efficacy than one of our products. If competitors introduce new products with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales.
Principal competitors for the pharmaceutical market in which we do business include Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Alvogen, Inc., Apotex Inc., Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Hikma Pharmaceuticals plc, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Padagis LLC., Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., and Viatris Inc.
Product Liability
Product liability litigation represents an inherent risk to all firms in the pharmaceutical industry. We utilize traditional third-party insurance policies with regard to our product liability claims. Such insurance coverage at any given time reflects current market conditions, including cost and availability, when the policy is written.
Human Capital
As of January 2023, we have 600 employees, of which 496 are located in the United States, including Puerto Rico, 48 are located in Canada, and 56 are located in India. We occasionally use a small number of part-time and consultant

resources to meet our operational needs and our turnover is in line with similar businesses in our industry and locations. We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment within all levels of the business.
Attracting and retaining talented employees is critical to the success of our business, especially at our manufacturing operations in Baudette, Minnesota, which is located in a sparsely populated area of Northern Minnesota, with a population of approximately 1,100. As a result, it can be challenging to find sufficiently qualified personnel in all functional areas. To address this, we support remote working arrangements for a number of employees in several functions throughout the business, including at the executive level. In September 2023, we opened a corporate office in Princeton, NJ which houses certain employees in our corporate, legal, and business functions. Additionally, our compensation plans are designed to be competitive within the pharmaceuticals industry as well as competitive with local employers for jobs of a cross-industry nature. Our approach provides ANI with the resources to recognize and reward employee performance, productivity, and quality commitment. Our total compensation program includes competitive base salaries, comprehensive benefits, and employee equity programs. 
Our U.S. and India facilities are committed to the safety and health of our employees, patient-customers, and the general public. It is critical within our mission to ensure we keep our employees and customers safe while accomplishing our business goals. We accomplish these initiatives through the following:
Health and Safety Management and Training
ANI has established a health and safety program with a focus on continuous improvement and employee engagement. ANI personnel are encouraged to take corrective actions where appropriate and to communicate concerns to management with a “see something, say something” approach. We recognize and reward personnel for contributing to the safety system within our working environment. The overall program continually evolves to reflect regulatory changes and compliance standard industry best practices. As part of onboarding new employees, we provide health and safety training and periodic training programs to maintain and improve employee awareness of safety issues. The goal of the safety training programs is to ensure that our staff are well informed on the subject matters and have the appropriate tools to make sound health and safety decisions in our day-to-day operations.
Environmental Stewardship
ANI is committed to minimizing waste and emissions, promoting reuse and recycling and conserving resources, where feasible, to reduce our environmental footprint on our environment.
