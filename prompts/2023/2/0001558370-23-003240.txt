Item 1.     Business
Dario is revolutionizing how people with chronic conditions manage their health through the innovation of a new category of digital health: Digital Therapeutics as a Service (“DTaaS”). We believe that our innovative approach to digital therapeutics disrupts the traditional provider-centered system of healthcare delivery by offering user-centric care that is continuous, customized supportive of better overall health. Our solutions combine the power of technologies and behavior science to make better health accessible, affordable, and easy for all by solving for what people need, when and where they want it, with hyper-personalized care that is always connected – to services, devices, and people – and delivered continuously. Our solutions are proven to drive savings for health plans and employers by improving the health of their populations.
Overview
We began as a direct-to-consumer digital therapeutics company, solving first for the problem of how to engage users and support behavior change to improve clinical outcomes in diabetes. Beginning in 2020, Dario enacted a strategic shift to transform the business model by deploying a business-to-business-to-consumer (“B2B2C”) approach, leveraging the strengths of our consumer solution platform to enable commercial growth opportunities in traditional health business channels by selling to health plans and employers.
​
At the same time, we expanded from a single-condition platform to a multi-condition platform, creating a robust suite of solutions to address the five most commonly co-occurring, behaviorally driven, and expensive chronic conditions, which are also representative of some of the most sought-after digital health solutions: diabetes, hypertension, pre-diabetes/weight management, musculoskeletal and behavioral health. After building weight loss and hypertension management into the legacy diabetes platform, we made three acquisitions in order to expand into musculoskeletal (“MSK”) and behavioral health (“BH”). In that regard, we acquired Upright Technologies Ltd. (“Upright”), PsyInnovations Inc. (“PsyInnovations”) and Physimax Technology assets to expand into the fields of MSK and BH . Our approach to integrating all solutions into one digital therapeutics platform follows the “best-of-suite” offering design principal which provides the user one place to monitor all identified chronic conditions and to deliver a seamless user experience for commonly co-occurring chronic conditions..
​
​
These two shifts led to the rapid expansion of our B2B2C business over the last two years and positioned the company for success in commercial markets. We continue to achieve key benchmarks as we rapidly scale our B2B2C model, including more than 100 total signed contracts as of today and the shift in our commercial pipeline where more

than 50% of the contracts signed in the second half of 2022 are for multi-chronic solutions. We believe we have a unique and defensible position in the market thanks to our unique solution origin in consumer markets.
​
We continue to generate a significant number of clinical publications. In that regard, we the have published 38 real world data studies with total of 10 generated in 2022, and several more already planned for 2023.
​
Recent Developments
​
Integration of Dexcom CGM Data 
​
We collaborated with Dexcom to integrate the data from its market-leading Continuous Glucose Monitoring (“CGMs)” technology, which uses a small, wearable sensor to continuously measure and send glucose levels to a receiver or smart device to enable better real-time decision making for people living with diabetes, into our multi-chronic condition platform. This partnership, signed in early 2023, enables the integration of data from Dexcom CGMs directly into our metabolic solution, making it easy for people using the wearable device to benefit from our highly personalized support.
Sanofi 
​
Our 2022 agreement with Sanofi continues to evolve after the first year of our agreement across all three pillars of the agreement. First, our co-promotion efforts are yielding a healthy pipeline of health plans and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (“PBMs”), and we have several opportunities in or close to contracting. Second, our product development has yielded several new features currently in beta testing with our consumer membership. We expect that these features will be released more broadly to the market in the spring of 2023. Third and finally, we are preparing our first two research studies with Sanofi with the release of data expected in the summer of 2023. 
Director and Officers
In January 2023, we announced that we executed a Termination of Employment and Separation with Dror Bacher, our prior Chief Operating Officer, pursuant to which Mr. Bacher’s position as Chief Operating Officer was terminated with immediate effect. We have retained Mr. Bacher as a member of our advisory board.
In February 2023, on the recommendation of the Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors, we expanded the Board by one seat and appointed Jon Kaplan as a member of the Board. 
​
Market Landscape 
​
The traditional healthcare industry is siloed and service-centric, and it is difficult for people to access care and support, while the healthcare experience itself remains cumbersome and disconnected. The future of health care is being shaped by digital health technologies that are rapidly becoming more important as access to traditional health care for the management of whole health becomes more difficult. As a direct-to-consumer pioneer, we presciently identified shifting healthcare consumer behaviors early and designed solutions with the intent of enabling users with easy-to-use technologies that support adoption and engagement. 
​
Our members demanded ease of access and personalization, generally absent in health care but a standard in other consumer service experiences, and our unique approach significantly exceeds those expectations with excellent ratings from our members. Commercial digital health solutions currently perform poorly in this area, which leads to low engagement and weak outcomes. 
​
As we expand our commercial business, we believe our consumer-centric solutions position us as a leader in digital health through a best-of-suite platform proven to deliver the experience people are demanding. This enables our service-oriented business model by delivering the engagement our clients demand and yields a stable form of revenue through an Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) model. 
​

Longer term, as the market for digital health solutions faces economic pressures, we believe our consumer origins arm has several natural advantages that will help propel our growth and cement our leadership position. First, we amassed a trove of billions of data points from our consumer engagement and dozens of clinical publications including multiyear studies with approximately 50,000 participants. 
​
Second, we built what we believe is the best-in-market clinical platform built with a focus on the overlapping chronic health needs present in our user base. This shift from a single condition platform to a multi-condition platform enables our best-of-suite approach. 
​
Two years post-shift from our business-to-consumer into a B2B2C business model, we believe that the financial impacts are validating our growth and DTaaS theses. Our pro-forma gross profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2022, excluding acquisition related amortizations, has improved to 50% of revenues in 2022 compared to 39% of revenues in 2021. In 2022, our commercial revenue exceeded our consumer revenue.
​
Competitive Strengths 
​
 We believe that we are proving the value of our solutions as enterprise business sales continue to grow. With more than 100 signed contracts to date, we have solid evidence on the key differentiators that lead to new business opportunities: a consumer-friendly approach that drives engagement; deep integration capabilities; and best-in-class clinical outcomes.
​
Consumer Friendly Approach
​
Most digital health solutions are built to address the needs of a business and then sold directly to the business, bypassing the difficult step of achieving consumer buy-in with respect to the product. Our experience as a direct-to-consumer company now leverages those insights to drive B2B2C commercial growth by working with health plans, employers, and provider groups and providing them with a solution that their end users are more likely to utilize. Our current and potential customers recognize that consumer engagement insights are critical to success, and they are prioritizing solutions with more of a consumer-focused experience. We believe that impaired user engagement in competitor solutions could also drive enterprise customers to switch to us.
​
Deep Integration Capabilities 
​
Our platform was designed with a flexible, open-framework that yields multi-faceted benefits for our members and partners including their clinical health and user experience. Our experience is a best of suite platform that leverages four points of integration to drive a connected, dynamic and adaptive user journey:
​

● | User data is being captured and integrated across the experience, driving a personalized member experience across applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | User interface, including mobile applications, have been integrated to support a unified member experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Clinical integration informs recommendations across conditions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | This is all supported by a fully integrated coaching experience which provides one coach who supports the member across their entire journey.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The native integration of data across our solutions, providing a single view of a member data across all conditions and interactions, fuels our consumer-centric approach to engagement and leads to a more seamless user experience.
​
Our ability to allow integrations at the platform-level, easily allowing for the ingestion and exportation of data, also positions us as uniquely able to support the more connected healthcare experience that members and our partners increasingly demand. The recent integration of Dexcom CGM data into our platform is one example of the utility of our open-platform, positioning us as an attractive choice for clients and partners interested in building towards the future state of digital health.

​
Clinical Outcomes
​
We believe that we lead the digital therapeutic market in published outcomes with 38 studies across our suite of solutions, including the first clinical research demonstrating the positive impact of managing multiple chronic conditions with one digital health solution. Our ability to use large, real-world, longitudinal data-sets gives us a natural advantage in the scope and type of studies that can be conducted compared to competitors.
​
This capability enables one of the unique elements of our partnership with Sanofi, allowing our data to be consumed by a third party for independent analysis and eventual publication in a study in mid-2023.
​
Our Product Offering
Our user-centric software platform integrates digital therapeutics, coaching, professional human support and medical devices to drive superior clinical and financial outcomes. Our best-of-suite suite of offerings is modular, allowing for enterprise clients to purchase one or more of our chronic condition management solutions, while enjoying the same best-in-class experience supported by our behavior change journey engine so our partners can be confident in achieving sustainable outcomes and value. Our suite of digital offerings includes:
​
Dario Metabolic (“Dario Evolve”)
​
Our metabolic solutions are designed to address some of the most commonly co-occurring metabolic health needs - diabetes, pre-diabetes, hypertension, and weight management - through a combination of software, our smartphone-connected tools, interaction with live coaches, and real-time data analysis to help inform and educate users of the relationship between their behaviors and their health outcomes to drive changes that last. 
​
Dario Musculoskeletal (“Dario Move”)
​
Our unique approach addresses the most common MSK conditions, including chronic pain, by dealing with the cause and empowers users to create behavioral change. Dario Move’s digital physical therapy programs and posture training help people improve strength and mobility by using a combination of software, wearable biofeedback sensors, and coaching to drive sustainable improvements in musculoskeletal health. The inclusion of posture training in the solution supports ongoing engagement in support of prevention and maintenance outside of an exercise therapy program.
​
​

In addition to a better unified member experience, our partners deploying Dario One enjoy several benefits from purchasing the entire suite of solutions: better overall health as evidenced by recent research published by us; the convenience and ease of a single vendor to manage; less strain on internal resources spread across several chronic condition management programs; and a more affordable program launches due to lower costs of implementation.
​
Dario’s Solution Main Components
Users vary significantly in their interests and preferences, and unique user preferences also vary over time with respect to the optimal timing, tone, content, channel, frequency, and interventions required to produce sustained behavior

change. Users’ interactions with devices, smartphones, coaches, providers, and third-party solutions must be personalized along these axes to ensure optimal engagement, retention, and outcomes. Furthermore, to engage and sustain user interest and participation, and drive outcomes, platforms must be dynamically responsive. Due to a lack of responsiveness to these types of variances, most digital health platforms that achieve high initial engagement often fail to retain users over time.
​
Key to our ability to accommodate user behavioral changes is our mature AI-driven user journey engine. While several in-market solutions now integrate health signals across a range of categories to apply limited, nominal personalization, primarily in the form of nudges, our solution is informed by years of user experience data from over 250,000 users that joined our chronic-condition platform, enabling us to continually personalize and adapt user journeys themselves (and not just messages) over time. Our journey engine drives our multichannel targeted outreach and enrollment campaigns, informs specific recommendations around a range of categories such as diet, physical activity, self-care, coaching interventions, and provider engagement, and evolves in real time in response to the data exhaust from a user’s interaction with the care ecosystem.
​
Our journey engine combines complex behavioral science insights with data from hundreds of thousands of users over several years to recommend AI-driven initial and updated care journeys in response to a user’s engagement with the platform. Most digital health solutions consist primarily of tracking, content, and nudges. These are often perceived by users as non-rewarding work, and often do not feel relevant to their concerns, particularly as they evolve over time. We believe that current in-market solutions trivialize within person changes over time and do not appropriately respond to the dynamically evolving interests of users. This results in reduced engagement and impaired outcomes. Our journey engine adapts user journeys to drive engagement, retention, and clinical outcomes by optimizing timing, tone, channel, content, frequency and intervention to deliver dynamically personalized user journeys that are more likely to result in the behavior changes needed to drive improved outcomes across a range of conditions. As we partner with solutions in additional conditions or categories, we engage new populations and generate fresh insights, enhancing the engagement and efficacy of these partnered solutions to deliver additional value to our users. The engine is designed for integration and scale; as we add populations and conditions for which behaviors are primary drivers of outcomes, our engine becomes more adept at customizing a user’s evolving preferences and needs.
Software Applications 
​
Our chronic condition management solutions are designed as three separate software applications to provide the best possible user experience across metabolic, MSK and behavioral health needs. Each application is integrated with Dario’s single digital therapeutics platform and behavior change journey engine to ensure the same hyper-personalized experience across each person’s unique health needs and preferences to keep them on track with healthy changes over time. 
​
Dario Evolve
​
Dario Evolve helps users change their behaviors and help better manage their diabetes, blood pressure and weight. Using real-time data and analysis, the app helps users track their progress and offers real-time feedback and customized content to support each individual’s needs and goals. Integration with the Dario journey engine ensure that each user receives holistic support and a highly personalized experience that keeps them on track for long-lasting results. 
​
Dario Move
​
 Dario Move helps users improve strength and mobility to help address chronic pain and improve overall musculoskeletal health. After completing an online assessment, each user receives a personalized, evidence-based exercise program that can be adjusted throughout their journey based on sensor data or self-reported feedback to a coach or in the app. Dario Move guides members through their tailored program with educational content to support long-term outcomes.

​
Our Commercial Channels 
​
We are focusing the go-forward business strategy around three key market opportunities: direct sales to employers and payers and partnerships with the ability to multiply our growth opportunities. We believe that our scalable business model selling digital therapeutics as a service through multi-year contracting relationships establishes a pipeline of ARR and has the potential to improve our gross margins over time. 
​
Our software solutions are sold across a range of channels to create multiple growth engines and support rapid adoption across all segments of the market. Our integrated product suite is designed to address a common and growing sentiment from enterprise customers expressing frustration with the large number of condition-specific solutions, lack of transparency, lackluster results and poor member experiences. Our integrated solution aligns with these key buyer pain points and is proven to deliver value to strategic partners through our differentiated approach in the market. Finally, our consumer-centric legacy remains a key component of our commercial strategy, bolstering our ongoing solution development by serving as an innovation laboratory for new services and product enhancements. 
​
Health Plans: Although health plans represent the longest and most complex purchasing cycle across our client base, these contracts often represent sizeable opportunities as they typically offer much larger potential member populations. We currently have three live contracts with health plans, two are regional payers and one is a large national plan, with several additional plans in negotiation and contracting at present day. 
​
Employers: Our most robust growth in 2022 came from the employer market, a key buyer to help demonstrate our ability to deliver results. Today, we have approximately 80 employer populations actively on our platform, and growth of our employer pipeline continues to grow and mature.
​
Partnerships: Strategic partnerships play a key role in helping to expand our reach across markets quickly and efficiently. Our consumer-centric platform, the rate at which we have evolved our product, added and integrated solutions and provided product improvements and ability to easily share data and support a multitude of integrations makes Dario

an attractive choice of partner for many in the market. One such significant partnership agreement is our collaboration with Sanofi, a global leader in health care, a relationship that resulted after an extensive search determined we are uniquely capable of providing the robust data and analytics required by Sanofi. The multi-year, $30 million-dollar agreement, is helping to accelerate commercial adoption of our full suite of digital therapeutics through the promotion of our solutions in Sanofi’s sales channels and the collaborative development of new products. We also entered into partner agreements with several large employer benefits platforms such as Virgin Health Pulse in 2021, helping expand our reach within the employer market. 
​
In addition to our partnership with Sanofi, Dario is actively pursuing distribution partnerships in both the payer and employer verticals. In 2022, we partnered with Solera to establish a payer channel through their large network of plans. We also entered into partnership agreements with several large platforms such as Virgin Health Pulse, Alliant Insurance Services, and Vitality Group, helping expand our reach within the employer market. Dario is actively pursuing new partnerships in both markets in 2023 to enhance our opportunities with a one-to-many approach. 
​
Consumers: Our ability to engage members and improve health begins with our consumer-centric approach, and this audience remains key to our commercialization at the enterprise client level. Our direct-to-consumer channel continues to attract members to our platform and provides a neutral audience to test innovative product ideas, something traditional B2B companies are unable to do given limitations on commercial membership. These insights inform both our AI-driven behavior change journey engine, helping continuously improve engagement and retention, and inform product design to ensure our solutions remain at the forefront of consumer expectations.

​
Dario reported an Average Reduction in Estimated HbA1C of 1.4% for High-Risk type 2 Diabetes Users.
We presented at the 77th ADA session a study that was titled “Reducing A1C Levels in Individuals with High-Risk Diabetes Using the Mobile Glucose Meter Technology.” In the study we reported an average reduction in estimated HbA1C of 1.4% for high-risk type 2 Diabetes users.
​
At the ADA 2018 session, Dario presented three real-world-data analysis studies, as detailed below.
Type 2 Diabetes Users of Dario Digital Diabetes Management System Experience a Shift from Greater than 180 mg/dL to Normal Glucose Levels with Sustainable Results

● | Reduction of 19.3% in high glucose readings within 12 months
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase of 11.3% in in-range readings within 12 months
--+--------------------------------------------------------

Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the DarioTM cloud database. A population of all active Type 2 Diabetic (T2D) users that took measurements with DarioTM Blood Glucose Monitoring System (“BGMS”) on average of 20 measurements per month during 2017. The study assessed the ratio of all high blood glucose readings (180-400 mg/dL) and the ratio of all normal blood glucose readings (80-120 mg/dL) in their first month of use to their last month of use during 2017 as recorded in the database.
Results: For 17,156 T2D users activated during 2017 the average ratio of high events (180-400 mg/dL) was reduced by 19.3% (from 28.4% to 22.9% of the entire measurements). While at the same time, the ratio of normal range readings (80-120 mg/dL) was increased by 11.3% (from 25.6% to 28.5% of the entire measurements). 
Updated Analysis combining 2017 and 2018 data totals 38,838 Type 2 Diabetes active users and 3,318,014 measurements show 14.3% decrease in high readings (180-400 mg/dL) and 9.2 % increase in In-range (80-120 mg/dL) readings
​
A decrease in High Readings and Severe Hyperglycemic Events for People with T2D over the Full Year of 2017 in Users Monitoring with Dario Digital Diabetes Management System

● | Reduction of 20% of High events (180-400 mg/dL) in T2D sustained within 12 months
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduction of 58% of Hyper events (>400mg/dL) in T2D within 12 months
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the DarioTM cloud database. A population of active Type 2 Diabetic (T2D) users that continuously measured their blood glucose using DarioTM BGMS during the full year of 2017 was evaluated. The study assessed the ratio of high (180-400 mg/dL) and hyperglycemic (>400mg/dL) blood glucose readings during full year of 2017 as recorded in the database. The average of high and hyperglycemic glucose readings were calculated in periods of 30-60, 60-90, 90-120, 120-150, 150-180, 180-210, 210-240, 240-270, 270-300, 300-330, 330-360 days and compared to first 30 days as a starting point of analysis.
Results: For 225 T2D active users the ratio of high events (180-400 mg/dL) was reduced gradually in 19.6% (from 23.4% to 18.8% of the entire measurements) from baseline compared to the 12th month of the year. Moreover, the ratio of severe hyperglycemia events (>400 mg/dL) was decreased in 57.8% (from 0.90% to 0.38% of the entire measurements) at the same period.

Continuous Reduction of Blood Glucose Average during One Year of Glucose Monitoring Using Dario Digital Monitoring System in a High-Risk Population

● | Reduction of 14% Blood Glucose average was observed in T2D within 12 months
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 76% of the population showed 24% improvement in Blood glucose average within 12 months
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methods: An exploratory data analysis study reviewed a population of high-risk active type 2 Diabetic users with initial 30 days glucose average above 180 mg/dL during a full calendar year. The study assessed the average blood glucose readings along a year of usage. The average of glucose readings was calculated per user in periods of 30 days intervals from 30-60 to 330-360 days and compared to the first 30 days as the starting point baseline of analysis.
Results: Overall of 238 highly engaged T2D users (more than one daily measurement in average) whose average blood glucose level was above 180mg/dL in the first 30 days of measurements (225±45 mg/dL) showed continuous reduction in glucose level average vs. baseline. Reduction in blood glucose average level was demonstrated gradually, in the succeeding 3, 6 and 12 months showing average decrease of 7%, 11% and 14% vs. baseline, respectively. Furthermore, 76% of the entire population (180 out of 238 users) improved their average blood glucose level over a year. Those 180 users (average blood glucose 228±46) showed an average decrease of 10%, 16% and 24% in their glucose average following 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively.
​
At the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) 2018 Dario presented a study titled “Decrease in Estimated A1C for people in High-risk over a full year of users monitoring with a digital Diabetes management system.”
A reduction of 1.4% in estimated HbA1C in Type 2 Diabetes high risk users from baseline after one year of the Dario system use.
Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the DarioTM cloud database. A population of high-risk (with baseline A1C > 7.5 percent), active users that continuously measured their blood glucose using DarioTM BGMS during a full year was evaluated. The study assessed estimated A1C values based on blood glucose readings during a full year as recorded in the database. The estimated A1C values were calculated in periods of 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and compared to first 30 days as a starting point of analysis.
Results: A group of 363 high-risk Dario BGMS users (A1C>7.5) with greater than two blood glucose measurements taken per day in the first 30 days and in the 12th month of the year was selected. Estimated A1C was improved by -0.7, -0.8 and -1 percent from baseline to 3, 6 and 9 months respectively, and remained -1 percent lower following 12 months of usage (8.65±0.96 vs.7.65±1.0). Moreover, subgroup analyses by diabetes type revealed substantial estimated A1C improvement among people with T2D showing improvement of -1 percent from baseline to 3, 6 months and 1.4 percent following 12 months (8.5 ± 0.91% vs. 7.14% ± 0.98%).
An additional study evaluated on the potential improvement in glycemic variability in Type 2 diabetes over six months in patients monitoring with Dario Digital Diabetes Management System. Dario presented the study results at the Advance Technologies and Treatment for Diabetes (ATTD) conference in February 2019 in Berlin. We presented two additional studies outcomes at ADA 2019 conference.
Decrease in Glycemic Variability for T2D over Six Months in Patients Monitoring with Dario Digital Diabetes Management System

● | Reduction of 14%-18% in measurements variability was observed in T2D within 6 months
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hypo events (<70 mg/dL) remained <1 event on average

Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the DarioTM database. A population of T2D high-risk patients (blood glucose measurements average (GMavg) >180 mg/dL) measuring more than 20 times in the first 

13



30 days (analysis baseline) was evaluated on days 60-90 (3 months) and 150-180 days (6 months). Standard deviation (SD) and GMavg were calculated and compared to the baseline.
Results: A group of 698 T2D high-risk DarioTM users was selected. GV was reduced by 10% and 14% from baseline through 3 and 6 months, respectively (SD of 55.7, 58.4 vs.65.0). GMavg was reduced by 8% and 12% from baseline through 3 and 6 months, respectively (201.1±25.57, 192.8±54.3 vs. 219.5±38.5) while patient’s hypoglycemic event (<70mg/dL) was in average, less than one (<1) during this period. Subgroup analyses (355 patients) revealed substantial GV improvement among non-Insulin T2D patients. The GV was reduced by 14% and 18% from baseline through 3 and 6 months, respectively (SD of 52.8, 50.7 vs.61.7).

T2D Users of Dario Digital Diabetes Management System Experience an Increase of in-range Glucose Levels Linked to App Engagement
Relative Increase of 10 % In-range linked to App engagement
Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the DarioTM cloud database. A population of active Type 2 Diabetic (T2D) users (>15 measurements per month on average) was evaluated. The study assessed the ratio of in-range blood glucose readings (70-140 mg/dL) as a function of App engagement level for 6 months as recorded in the database compared to first 30 days as a starting point of analysis.
Results: A population of 4917 T2D non-insulin users measuring more than 15 times per month on average during 6 months in a row was evaluated. The ratio of in-range (70-140 mg/dL) readings was increased following 3 months in correlation to the level of tagging meal reference/carbs/physical activity occurrences (4.0%, 9.1% and 11.9% for tagging 0-1, 1-2 and >2 times per day on average, respectively) and sustained for 6 months

Reduction of Blood Glucose Average Less than 140mg/dL in People with Type2 Diabetes Using Dario Digital Diabetes Management System
30-40% of T2D Dario users experienced Reduction of Blood Glucose Average below 140 mg/dL
Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the DarioTM cloud database. A population of active T2D users that continuously measured for 6 months was evaluated. The study assessed their BG avg and estimated A1C (eA1C) values based on blood glucose readings as recorded in the database. Values were calculated in periods of 3 and 6 months and compared to their first 30 days as a starting point analysis.
Results: A group of 1248 Dario BGMS T2D active users (1.98 measurements per day on average during 6 months in a row) with BG avg >140mg/dL (eA1C>6.5) was evaluated. All 1248 (100%) reduced their BG avg along 6 months on average.
A group of 31% (387) achieved BG avg of <140 mg/dL (eA1C<6.5) following 3 months showing 19% reduction on average from baseline (132.38±13.36 vs.162.79±25.41 mg/dL and eA1C 6.24±0.46 vs 7.3±0.88) and sustained their glycemic control during a 6 month period (131.57±13.86 mg/dL and eA1C 6.21±0.48).
Subgroup analyses of 568 non-insulin users revealed that 40% (226) achieved a BG avg <140 mg/dL following 3 months (131.95±13.21 vs.161.67±24.18 mg/dL and eA1C 6.22±0.46 vs 7.26±0.84) and sustained for 6 months period (131.03±13.70 mg/dL and eA1C 6.19±0.47). Along the 6 months period, hypo events (<50mg/dL) per user per month on average remained stable.
In August 2019 another study was presented at the AADE 2019 in Atlanta. The study evaluated the “Impact of Digital Intervention on In-range Glucose Levels in Users with Diabetes.” The study results showed 6% improvement in average blood glucose levels over 3 months intervention program for a group of 162 users. A 39% increase in the in-range (80-130 mg/dL; <180mg/dL post-meal) measurements was observed in a subgroup of 101 patients who started with

average blood glucose levels of over 140mg/dL. In November 2019, another analysis was presented in Diabetes Technology conference ”The Effect of Digital Intervention on Glycemic Control in Users with Diabetes” looking on total in-range measurements ratio 70-180 mg/dL showing increase of 19% following 3 months on the Dario Engage platform. 
In February 2020, we presented an additional clinical study at the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (“ATTD”) conference in Madrid, Spain. The presented data shows the Dario digital therapeutics platform successfully assists insulin dependent patients with diabetes in reducing hypoglycemic events.
​
Decrease in Hypoglycemia Events Over Two Years in Patients Monitoring with Dario’s Digital Diabetes Management System
Method: A retrospective data analysis was performed on the Dario real-world database. Insulin dependent of users with type 1 or type 2 diabetes population was evaluated for two year of continuous system use. Average numbers of level 1 hypoglycemia (<70mg/dL) and level 2 hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL) events were calculated monthly and compared to baseline (first month).
Results: For 1481 type 1 and type 2 insulin dependent users, average of level 1 hypoglycemia events and level 2 were reduced by 24% and by 17% after 6 months and by 50% and 57% after 2 years vs. baseline respectively. Users with type 1 diabetes (N=363) reduced level 1 hypoglycemia events by 50% and Level 2 by 55% after 2 years. Moreover, a 40% reduction in high blood glucose readings was observed as well after 2 years.
​
In June 2020, we presented two clinical studies at the ADA Virtual conference. The presented data from these studies showed:
Estimated A1C Reduction in High-Risk Patients Over Two Years of Using a Digital Diabetes Management Platform
 This study presented data indicated the potential for a digital diabetes management solution to effect and sustain glycemic control improvements and demonstrated long term reduction of blood glucose average (eA1c) and glycemic variability in type 2 diabetes over two years. The system assists users through a variety of mechanisms including behavior modification in diabetes self-management and in long-term routines for self-care.
​
Method: A retrospective study of high-risk users (BG avg >180 mg/dL equivalent to e A1c 8.0) 2 with type 2 diabetes that measured their blood glucose using the Dario® platform database over two consecutive years was performed. The minimum engagement level for inclusion was at least two blood glucose measurements per day on average taken in Month 1 and Month 24. Actual blood glucose readings were taken by the Dario meter and loaded into the cloud database. These were evaluated for the blood glucose average (BGavg), estimated A1c (eA1c)values and glycemic variability (by Standard Deviation; SD) following 24 months compared to the first month (baseline).
Results: 368 high-risk, T2D active and engaged users for at least consecutive 2 years were identified and assessed for their risk-level and insulin usage. A group of 148 T2D, non-Insulin users that started with a blood glucose average (BG avg) >180 mg/dl (equivalent to eA1c>8.0) consistently reduced their BG avg by 18% on average and sustained these values (179±45 vs. 219±56 mg/dL) following 2 years on the Dario platform. Glycemic variability was reduced over two years by 20% on average (SD:45 vs. 56) . Substantial reductions were observed for higher risk groups (insulin and non-insulin treated). The subset that started with average BG levels > 212 mg/dL (eA1c >9.0) and average BG levels >240 mg/dL (eA1c>10) reduced their average BG by 22.5% and 25.7% respectively on average over two years. The equivalent reductions in eA1c were 1.95% and 2.42%.

Users with type 2 diabetes using a digital platform experienced sustained improvement in blood glucose levels.
Method: A retrospective data evaluation (Q1:2018-2019) was performed on the Dario® data base. A population of active users (18 measurements per month with the Dario® System on average) with T2D, non-Insulin treated was evaluated over a full year. High blood glucose readings (180-400 mg/dL, >250 mg/dL), fasting readings (<126 mg/dL) and post-meal readings (<180mg/dL) ratios were assessed in their first month of use until the 12th month.
Results: For 9,200 users with T2D, non-Insulin users, the average ratio of high glycemia events (180-400 mg/dL) from entire set of measurements was reduced by 26% (18.62% vs. 23.43%) while readings of >250mg/dL were reduced by 33% (4.65% vs. 6.93%) over a year. Fasting measurements analysis revealed an increase of 16% in ratios of readings <126 mg/dL per entire set of fasting measurements (40.59% vs. 34.92%) on average. Post-meal readings ratio of <180 mg/dL per entire post-meal measurements increased by 5% (73.75% vs. 70.42%) on average over a year.
In August 2020, we presented an additional clinical study at the Virtual Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists (ADCES) conference. The presented observational study data demonstrated better glycemic and blood pressure control. Patients using an integrated chronic disease management digital platform have the potential to improve user activation which may assist to better manage their blood glucose and blood pressure levels and sustain behavioral change.
Impact of Digital Management on Clinical Outcome in Patients with Chronic Conditions: Diabetes and Hypertension.
Hypertension: Increase in normal level % measurements from 6% to 12% while hypertension stage 2 measurements decreased from 53% to 45%. 70% of the users (243 out of 345) improved their blood pressure levels by 8.4 mmHg Systolic and 6.2 mmHg Diastolic, on average.
Glucose levels: A reduction of 33% in high readings (>250 mg/dL) and 67% in severe events (>400 mg/dL) was observed over six months.
Methods: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the DarioTM cloud database. A population of active users that measured both blood pressure and blood glucose for at least 3 months was observed. Blood pressure and blood glucose levels were evaluated. First month measuring on Dario platform was used as study baseline. Clinical outcomes examined were blood pressure values, percentage of blood pressure categories, average blood glucose (BGavg) and high blood glucose readings (>250 mg/dL, >400 mg/dL) ratios.
Results: A group of 345 active users started at baseline with Hypertension stage 1, 2 or hypertensive crisis levels and measured following 3 months was evaluated.

In Feb 2021 we published in the first time in a peer-reviewed journal “Journal of Medical Internet research (JMIR) Diabetes”, the article: 
​
“Role of Digital Engagement in Diabetes Care Beyond Measurement: Retrospective Cohort Study”
​
This study sheds light on the source of the association between user engagement with a diabetes tracking app and the clinical condition, highlighting the importance of within-person changes versus between-person differences. Our findings underscore the need for and provide a basis for a personalized approach to digital health.
​
 Method: This retrospective real-world analysis followed 998 people with type 2 diabetes who regularly tracked their blood glucose levels with the Dario digital therapeutics platform for chronic diseases. Subjects included “nontaggers” (users who rarely or never used app features to notice and track mealtime, food, exercise, mood, and location, n=585) and “taggers” (users who used these features, n=413) representing increased digital engagement. Within- and between-person variabilities in tagging behavior were disaggregated to reveal the association between tagging behavior and blood glucose levels. The associations between an individual’s tagging behavior in a given month and the monthly average blood glucose level in the following month were analyzed for quasicausal effects. A generalized mixed piecewise statistical framework was applied throughout.
​
 Results: Analysis revealed significant improvement in the monthly average blood glucose level during the first 6 months (t=−10.01, P<.001), which was maintained during the following 6 months (t=−1.54, P=.12). Moreover, taggers demonstrated a significantly steeper improvement in the initial period relative to nontaggers (t=2.15, P=.03). Additional findings included a within-user quasicausal nonlinear link between tagging behavior and glucose control improvement with a 1-month lag. More specifically, increased tagging behavior in any given month resulted in a 43% improvement in glucose levels in the next month up to a person-specific average in tagging intensity (t=−11.02, P<.001). Above that within-person mean level of digital engagement, glucose levels remained stable but did not show additional improvement with increased tagging (t=0.82, P=.41). When assessed alongside within-person effects, between-person changes in tagging behavior were not associated with changes in monthly average glucose levels (t=1.30, P=.20).
​
​
In February 2021, we also presented two studies virtually in ATTD. 
​
Impact of a Digital Intervention Engine on Diabetes Self-management
A digital diabetes platform has the potential to consistently interact with users, improve self-management and sustain among users who had not recently measured their blood glucose.
​
Method: A retrospective study was performed on a population of 246 Dario active members who had not measured blood glucose for a 7-day period. 127 of these users were randomly assigned to a Test group and experienced a digital intervention flow, and the remaining 119 users were assigned to a Control group.
​
Results: Digital engagement levels were observed following 60 days in both groups. Differences between Test group and Control group were observed. In the Test group, the percent of users who measured blood glucose was significantly higher (P<0.001): 14% in first 30 days and 22% in 30-60 days; average number of measurements was 6% higher in the first 30 days and 17% in 30-60 days; number of interactions (e.g. logging fasting glucose) with the digital platform was 10% higher in first 30 days and 15% in 30-60 days. Difference in average days between measurements, defined as “recency” was 30% lower in the test group.

​
Impact of a Digital Therapeutic on Insulin Self-Management​
The potential benefit of a digital diabetes management platform in the self-management required from insulin treated users, incorporating its use on a daily base, and sustaining behavioral change. 
​
Method: A retrospective study was performed on a population of 285 active Dario users (85% with type 2) under insulin therapy, that measured with Dario for at least three months and logged basal insulin usage. The group included 112 users whose starting average blood glucose >180 mg/dL. Among this group the average age was 55. The group also included 173 users whose starting average blood glucose was <180 mg/dL with average age 59. First month measuring on platform was used as study baseline.
​
Results: In the sub-group of 112 users the average amount of basal insulin increased by six units after three months (45 vs.39). Their fasting blood glucose was significantly reduced (9%) after three months (186±40.6 vs. 204±42.7) without change in hypoglycemia events ratio (<70 mg/dL) on average, and 15% of the users reduced their fasting average to <126 mg/dL. However, in the sub-group of 173 users, basal insulin usage and fasting glucose levels remained stable following three months. 
​
In May 2021, a prospective pilot study was published in “Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology” the article: 

“Digital Therapeutics for Type 2 Diabetes: Incorporating Coaching Support and Validating Digital Monitoring​”​
The study suggests that a diabetes digital platform with real-time feedback and access to coaching improved diabetes outcome measures such as HbA1c with a reduction in GV. Importantly, we provide clinical validation for digital self-monitoring to deliver personalized care for patients with T2DM. Future research should replicate our findings using a larger sample.
​Method: In this study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04057248), 12 participants with baseline HbA1c >8.5% were provided with Dario digital therapeutic platform (connected blood glucose meter, test strips, mobile app and access to live CDCES). At both study enrollment and completion, participants completed blood testing and a satisfaction report. During 3-month intervention, participants tracked their blood glucose levels through the app and were routinely contacted by CDCES. Clinical outcomes and self reported data before and after intervention were compared
​
Results: 

● | Significant reduction in lab values such as HbA1c (2 points), Fasting Blood Glucose (18%) and Body Mass Index (BMI) (10%)​
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Statistically significant improvement in glucose variability (21%)​

In June 2021, two studies were presented in ADA:
​
Impact of Digital Intervention Tools on Engagement and Glycemic Outcomes
​
Product updates to digital platforms that guide on healthy eating and help users understand their glucose readings in context may assist users in improving the management of their diabetes.
​
Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on Dario TM members during the time before and after product modification. Digital engagement and clinical outcomes were measured on first to six months per each period to examine if habit formation was achieved.
​

18



Results: A group of total 9794 users who had enrolled in a membership for 6 months or longer was evaluated. The digital engagement was improved. The ratio of measurements logged with context (fasting, pre-meal, post-meal, bedtime) was increased significantly by 56% in the first month following product modification on average (51.3%. vs. 32.8%) (P<0.001). Differences in the level of digital engagement remained stable over a 6 month period. The average number of days between measurements, i.e. “recency” decreased by 21% on average (2.71 vs. 3.45). Average ratios of high readings (180-400 mg/dL) were reduced by 12% on average over six months.
​
Users with high-risk type 2 diabetes using a digital therapeutic platform experience a change in blood glucose levels 
​
Digital diabetes platform has the potential to enhance self-care behaviors across socioeconomic statuses and among different language speakers.
​
Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the DarioTM data base. A population (“high-risk users”) of all users with type 2 diabetes activated during 2017-2020 who took measurements with Dario in the first 2 months and who started with an average blood glucose above 180 mg/dL was evaluated. The ratios assessed were target range (70-180 mg/dL) and high blood glucose (>180 mg/dL) readings over a year. Socioeconomic status was matched by applying zip code data to census.gov data.
​Results: For 11,101 users, the average ratio of target range readings (70-180 mg/dL) was significantly increased from 28.4% to 54.8% (P<0.001). Average high events ratio (>180 mg/dL) was significantly reduced from 71.3% to 44.4% over a full year usage (P<0.001). The change appeared in the earliest months and was maintained over a year. Average number of days between measurements, i.e., “recency” was 3.3 days. A subset of Spanish language app users (N=169) was also evaluated, and comparable trends were observed. Matching Census.gov data on study population showed that 20% of users resided in low income zip codes, 70% in middle and 10% in upper income zip codes.

In August 2021, we presented additional clinical study data at the ADCES meeting. 
Efficacy of a tailored digital intervention tool targeting patients with clustered recurrent high glucose readings
The potential benefit of implementing a real-time digital diabetes intervention journey to recognize episodes of high blood glucose measurement clusters and assist patients in improving self-management and clinical outcomes. 
Method: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on a population of 3,609 users who experienced a cluster event of frequent high blood glucose levels above 250 mg/dL (>=4 times in 4 different days along 7 days) and measured with Dario at least one month before and after the event during 2021. A group of 1,084 users was assigned to a Test group who experienced a digital intervention flow with personalized messages via various channels. The remaining 2,525 users were assigned to a Control group. The clinical outcome examined was the monthly average of high blood glucose readings ratio calculated as the number of blood glucose measurements >250 mg/dL per total number of measurements in a month. This was measured during the event month and in the following month. T-test was used to compare the changes in high readings ratio in the Test group and Control group in the following month versus event month.
Results: A significant difference of 19% vs. control group (N=3,609), 18% for the group with type 2 (N=2307) and 42% for the group with type 2 non-insulin, in the reduction in average monthly ratio of high readings (above 250 mg/dL) per total blood glucose measurements in the following month. The results indicate personalized communications are effectively influencing positive lifestyle behavior change
A group of 454 users experienced the cluster event in a 6-month period before the digital journey was activated and after. A significant difference was observed after the digital journey versus before the digital journey in the following month’s change in high readings ratio (-8% vs. +5%; P-value <0.03)

In February 2022, another article was published in “Journal of Medical Internet research (JMIR)”
“Blood Pressure Monitoring as a Digital Health Tool for Improving Diabetes Clinical Outcomes: Retrospective Real-world Study​”
​ The results of this study shed light on the association between BG and BP levels and on the role of BP self-monitoring in diabetes management. Our findings also underscore the need and provide a basis for a comprehensive approach to understanding the mechanism of BP regulation associated with BG.
Method: In this retrospective, real-world case-control study, we extracted the data of 269 people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who tracked their BG levels using the Dario digital platform for a chronic condition. We analyzed the digital data of the users who, in addition to BG, monitored their BP using the same app (BP-monitoring [BPM] group, n=137) 6 months before and after starting their BP monitoring. Propensity score matching established a control group, no blood pressure monitoring (NBPM, n=132), matched on demographic and baseline clinical measures to the BPM group. A piecewise mixed model was used for analyzing the time trajectories of BG, BP, and their lagged association
Results: Analysis revealed a significant difference in BG time trajectories associated with BP monitoring in BPM and NBPM groups (t=–2.12, P=.03). The BPM group demonstrated BG reduction improvement in the monthly average BG levels during the first 6 months (t=–3.57, P<.001), while BG did not change for the NBPM group (t=0.39, P=.70). Both groups showed similarly stable BG time trajectories (B=0.98, t=1.16, P=.25) before starting the use of the BP-monitoring system. In addition, the BPM group showed a significant reduction in systolic (t=–6.42, P<.001) and diastolic (t=–4.80, P<.001) BP during the first 6 months of BP monitoring. Finally, BG levels were positively associated with systolic (B=0.24, t=2.77, P=.001) and diastolic (B=0.30, t=2.41, P=.02) BP.
In February 2022, we presented virtually in ATTD:
Impact of a digital therapeutic platform on weight loss and diabetes self-management
This observational study demonstrates the potential for digital platforms to durably improve diabetes and weight self-management among users with BMI of ≥30 kg/m2.
Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 715 Dario active members who started with a baseline BMI of ≥30 kg/m2 (51% male; 48% female; 80% with type 2 diabetes) and who recorded weight measurements for at least 12 months. Weight measurements and blood glucose readings were observed over 12 months. 
Results: The total population of 715 users who participated in the study improved their weight level on average (p<0.05). Nearly two-thirds of the population improved their weight, with an average reduction of 7.4% (p<0.05) and an average reduction in BMI of 2.8 kg/m2 . Over 30 percent achieved weight loss of 5% or greater over 12 months. A subset of 237 engaged users who started with BMI of ≥35 kg/m2 achieved weight loss of 5% over 12 months (p<0.05). The subgroup of 108 users that started at high-risk blood glucose levels (average blood glucose >180 mg/dL) reduced their weight by 4.9%, average blood glucose by 16.1% and high readings ratio by 38% over 12 months (p<0.05).
In June 2022, three retrospective data analysis studies were presented in ADA:
Persons with high-risk diabetes, depression and stress using a Digital health platform experience improvement in glycemic management
The use of a multi-condition digital therapeutic platform may be associated with improved glucose management for persons with “high risk” glycemia who cope with depression and stress. The present study revealed that a digital multi-condition platform has the potential to enhance self-care behaviors among people with diabetes that suffer from stress and depression. 

Methods: A retrospective data analysis on the DarioTM database of users who activated the mobile app during 2019-2021 and who self-reported stress and depression in the app questionnaire. Participants who took at least 5 measurements 

20



during their 1st and 12th months with Dario and who started with an average blood glucose >180 mg/dL were termed “high-risk”. A statistical analysis (T-test) was used to evaluate the differences in average blood glucose and high blood glucose (>180 mg/dL) readings ratio over a year.
Results: The high-risk group of 491 users significantly reduced their average blood glucose by 13% (204±60 vs. 234±55) (P<0.001). A subset of high-risk users with type 2 (N=379) was also evaluated and significantly reduced their average blood glucose by 14% (P<0.001) (201±66 vs. 233±53). Moreover, high glucose events ratio (>180 mg/dL) was significantly reduced from 72.6% to 55.8% over a full year of usage (P<0.001) (N=343). 
​
Hypertension control among persons with diabetes using a self-management multicondition digital platform
A multi-condition digital therapeutic platform may promote behavioral modifications and result in sustainable improvements in both glycemic control and blood pressure levels. The study demonstrates an improvement in multiple chronic conditions (diabetes and hypertension) for people using one digital platform. 
Method: A retrospective data evaluation was performed on the Dario data base. A population of active users who started with hypertension stage 1 (Systolic ≥130 mmHg or Diastolic ≥ 80mmHg) as their baseline since 2019 was identified. Blood glucose and blood pressure readings were assessed at first and sixth month of use. A subgroup of users who started at hypertension stage 2 was evaluated as well. A statistical analysis (T-test) was used to evaluate differences in Systolic and Diastolic pressures and average blood glucose.
Results: 

● | For the 2554 users with diabetes and hypertension stage 1 and above, more than two thirds improved their systolic blood pressure by 13 mmHg (P<0.001; 144±14 to 131±13) and diastolic blood pressure by 8 mmHg (P<0.001; 91±12 to 83±10) over six months. Additionally, a group of 38.7% (N=990) moved to a lower hypertensive stage (P<0.001) according to American Heart Association definitions. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The subset of 1367 users with stage 2 hypertension improved their systolic blood pressure from 150±12.4 to 141±15.2 mmHg on average and 43.9% (N=600) improved their blood pressure by more than 10 mmHg over six months (P<0.001).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The subgroup of 306 users who started at high-risk blood glucose levels significantly reduced their blood glucose average by 15% over 6 months (232.4±46 to 198±65 mg/dL) (P<0.001).

Blood Glucose Levels in High-Risk Type 2 Diabetes Users of a Digital Therapeutic Platform by Race/Ethnicity​
Digital therapeutic platforms may promote behavior modification in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes to create sustainable outcomes and allow the users to become more active participants in their chronic condition. The study revealed that the digital diabetes platform has the potential to enhance self-care behaviors across diverse populations.
Method: A retrospective data study was performed on the Dario database. A group of Dario digital therapeutic users with type 2 diabetes that was active during 2019-2021 and took at least three blood glucose measurements in the first and 12th months was evaluated. The group started with average blood glucose above 180 mg/dL in the first month and reported Ethnicity in the app: White, Latino, Black, or Asian. The baseline was defined as the first month’s average blood glucose. A statistical analysis (Wilcoxon and Kruskal – Wallis tests) was used to evaluate the difference between groups in their average blood glucose levels over a year. 
Results:
21




● | A group of 1000 users was analyzed, male 483 (48%) and female 517 (52%). Average blood glucose was significantly reduced in all users and per ethnic group over a year: All users by 14% (230±58 vs. 197±47) (p<0.001); White by 14% (229±58 vs. 197±47) ) (p<0.001); Latino by 15% (237±59 vs. 202±48) (p<0.001); Black by 15% (230±63 vs. 196±48) (p<0.001) and Asian by 15% (229±55 vs.195±43) (p<0.005).

Digital therapeutic platforms improve blood glucose management across rural/nonrural groups.
The study supports the hypothesis that digital diabetes platforms have the potential to enhance self-care behaviors across challenging population from varied socioeconomic statuses in high-risk patients with T2DM. 
Methods: A retrospective data study was performed on the Dario database. A group of T2DM “high-risk” users started with an average blood glucose of 180 mg/dL and above in the first month (baseline), was evaluated. The group of Dario users were active at 2019-2021 and took at least six blood glucose measurements in the first, 6th and 12th months. Members residency was defined as rural or nonrural based on whether their community was eligible to apply for Rural Health Grants by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (“FORHP”) (10). Nonparametric tests were used to evaluate the differences in average blood glucose levels over a year. 
Results:

● | A group of 1333 users was analyzed with demographic characteristics as follows: Nonrural 1157 (87%) and Rural 176 (13%).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The blood glucose average mg/dl was significantly reduced (Friedman tests) in all users and in each rural/nonrural group over a year: Nonrural reduced by 17% from T0 to T12 (228±59 vs. 190±47) (P<0.001); Rural reduced by 13% from T0 to T12 (224±60 vs. 196±51) (P<0.001).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No significant difference between Rural/Nonrural groups was found at first, 6th and 12th months periods (Kruskal-Wallis, P=0.235/0.163/0.142 respectively).

In August 2022, we published in the first-time two retrospective data analysis on behavioral health outcomes, Depression and Anxiety in the American Psychology Association (APA).
Effectiveness of a Digital Behavioral Health Solution for Depression Symptoms
This study provides preliminary insights into the effectiveness of a digital chronic condition platform to facilitate symptom reduction in individuals screened for depression.

● | Methods: A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the Dario database. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (“PHQ-9”) was utilized to screen for depression severity and track progress over time. The current sample is based on individuals who used the Dario Behavioral Health platform between 2019-2021, and completed at least two PHQ-9 assessments, one at baseline and the second between baseline and 12 weeks of platform utilization. Scores were calculated based on PHQ-9 scoring guidelines. Users were stratified based on severity as minimal-mild (score 0-9), mild-moderate and severe-moderate (10-19), or Severe (>=20).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Results:

● | A group of 496 platform users (376 women, 108 men, 12 other) who completed two assessments of PHQ-9 was evaluated. The population included 269 users who started at minimal-mild severity and 227 who started at moderate or severe severity (175 moderate; 52 severe).The minimal-mild group mostly maintained at the same level of average PHQ-9 score post assessment. The moderate-severe group significantly improved their average PHQ-9 score (P<0.001).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | A proportion of 72% of moderate-severe users showed improvement in their post PHQ-9 assessment and 38% of moderate-severe users reported scores in the minimal-mild range over the study period. Moreover, 44% of the moderate-severe population experienced a clinically significant score reduction (reduction of >5) in the full PHQ-9 over the study period. Out of 175 users who started at a moderate depression level, and 162 (93%) improved or maintained their level and out of 52 users who started at a severe depression level, 30 (58%) users reduced their level to moderate or minimal-mild.

Effectiveness of a Digital Behavioral Health Solution for Anxiety Symptoms
This study provides preliminary insights into the effectiveness of a digital chronic condition platform to facilitate symptom reduction in individuals screened for anxiety.
Methods:  A retrospective data evaluation study was performed on the Dario database. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) was utilized to screen for anxiety severity and track progress over time. The current sample is based on individuals who used the Dario Behavioral Health platform between 2019-2021, and completed at least two GAD-7 assessments, one at baseline and the second between baseline and 12 weeks of platform utilization. Scores were calculated based on GAD-7 scoring guidelines. Users were stratified based on severity as minimal-mild (score 0-9), moderate (10-14), or Severe (>=15). 
 Results:

● | The group of 523 platform users who completed two assessments of GAD-7 was evaluated; 297 users had baseline scores in the minimal-mild range and 226 were moderate or severe. The severe group significantly improved their average GAD-7 score (P<0.001; paired t-test). A proportion of 68% from the severe users improved their score, and 42% of the severe users reported scores in minimal-mild range over the study period (P<0.001). Moreover, 40% of the severe population experienced a clinically significant score reduction (reduction of >5) in GAD-7 over the study period. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The minimal-mild group mostly maintained their levels and hence did not escalate to higher severity while using the care platform. Additionally, out of 100 users who started at a moderate anxiety level, 84 (84%) improved or maintained their level (P<0.001), and out of 126 users started at a severe anxiety level, 69 (55%) reduced their level to moderate or minimal-mild (P<0.001).

On September 2022, a retrospective data analysis study was published in “International Association for the Study of Pain” (IASP) large conference. 
Pain level reduction mediated by perceived posture quality and training duration in patients using digital therapeutic biofeedback technology
The study sheds light on the nature of the linkage between posture biofeedback technology and pain reduction. Based on the findings of our mediation model constructed on a lagged association between training duration, perceived posture quality, and pain levels, we suggest that posture quality is a potential mechanism for posture training-related analgesia. 
Method: A retrospective real-world study examined 981 users who used the Dario posture trainer. Training duration, defined as the time the device is worn (hours), was recorded. This study utilized the Dario posture trainer, Upright in Dario Health, a wearable postural biofeedback device.
Results: Posture biofeedback training duration was significantly associated with pain levels (B=-0.0002, p<0.001). Also, the training duration predicted the following week’s posture quality (B=0.0004, p<0.001) and in turn posture quality predicted the following week’s pain. 
In December 2022, a first manuscript was published in a peer-reviewed journal on retrospective data analysis on UpRight posture biofeedback platform.

The two-stage therapeutic effect of posture biofeedback training on back pain and the associated mechanism: A retrospective cohort study
The study findings provided a better understanding of the therapeutic dynamic during digital biofeedback intervention targeting pain, modeling the associated two-stage process. Moreover, the study sheds light on the biofeedback mechanism and may assist in developing a better therapeutic approach targeting perceived posture quality.
​
Methods: This retrospective real-world evidence study followed 981 users who used the UpRight posture biofeedback platform. Piecewise mixed models were used for modeling the two-stage trajectory of pain levels, perceived posture quality, and weekly training duration following an 8-week biofeedback training. Also, the mediation effect of perceived posture quality on the analgesic effect of training duration was tested using Monte Carlo simulations based on lagged effect mixed models.
Results: The analysis revealed significant pain level reduction of 50% (p <.0001) and posture quality improvement (p <.0001) during the first 4 weeks of the training, maintaining similar pain levels and perceived posture quality during the next 4 weeks. In addition, weekly training duration demonstrated an increase during the first 3 weeks (p <.001) and decreased during the next 5 weeks (p <.001). Moreover, training duration predicted following-week perceived posture quality (p <.001) and in turn perceived posture quality predicted following-week pain (p <.001) (p = 0.30). Finally, perceived posture quality mediated the effect of weekly training duration on the pain levels in 2 weeks (p <.0001).

Government Regulation
The principal markets that we have initially targeted for Dario are the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand. The following is an overview of the regulatory regimes in these jurisdictions.
United States Regulation Generally
In the United States, devices are subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation is conducted before a device receives clearance for commercial distribution.  Under Section 201(h) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, a medical device is an article, which, among other things, is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, in man or other animals.  The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is classified as a medical device and subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the FDA and its foreign counterparts.  FDA regulations govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, pre-market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, and sales and distribution.  Specifically, the FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices are relatively simple and can be manufactured and distributed with general controls.  Class II devices are somewhat more complex and require greater scrutiny.  Class III devices are new and frequently help sustain life.
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States will require a 510(k) clearance, 510(k)+ “de-novo” clearance, or pre-market approval (or PMA) from the FDA.
510(k) Clearance Process.   After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could even require a premarket application approval.  The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision.  If the FDA disagrees with the determination, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket application approval.  The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket application approval is obtained.
De Novo Classification.   If the FDA denies 510(k) clearance of a device because it is novel and an adequate predicate device does not exist, the “de novo classification” procedure can be invoked based upon a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use.  This procedure approximates the level of scrutiny in the 510(k) 

24



process but may add several months to the clearance process. If the FDA grants the request, the device is permitted to enter commercial distribution in the same manner as if 510(k) clearance had been granted.
Premarket Application Approval Process.   After approval of a premarket application, a new premarket application or premarket application supplement is required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process.  The premarket application approval pathway is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain.  It generally takes from one to three years or longer.
European and Non-European Regulation Generally
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. These laws and regulations range from simple product registration requirements in some countries to complex clearance and production controls in others.  As a result, the processes and time periods required to obtain foreign marketing clearance may be longer or shorter than those necessary to obtain FDA clearance.
The commercialization of medical devices in Europe is regulated by the European Union. The European Union presently requires that all medical products bore the CE mark, an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and demonstrated clinical effectiveness.  Compliance with the Medical Device Directive (MDD) or the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMD) or the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (IVDD) as audited by a notified body and certified by a recognized European Competent Authority, permits the manufacturer to affix the CE mark on its products.
In September 2013, we obtained ISO 13485 certification for our quality management system and CE Mark certification to market Dario, and in May 2015 Dario was cleared to fulfill the criteria according to EN ISO 15197:2013 The granting of the CE Mark allows Dario to be marketed and sold in 32 countries across Europe as well as in certain other countries worldwide. On November 21, 2014, MDSS, our European Authorized Representative, completed the registration of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System with the German Authority as required by Article 10 of Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. We commenced an initial soft launch of the product in Europe in 2014, created initial demand for the product and established brand awareness and marketing techniques to reach our target market with a goal to continue expansion to new markets and territories.
We achieved regulatory clearance to market Dario in other countries that do not rely on the CE Mark. To date, the non-CE Mark jurisdictions which we have begun to market Dario include the United States, New Zealand, Canada, and Australia.
To the extent that we seek to market our product in other non-CE Mark countries in the future, we will be required to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements in each such country.  Such regulatory requirements vary by country and may be tedious.  As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be able to satisfy the regulatory requirements to sell our products in any such country.
Clinical Studies
Even when a clinical study has an approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA under significant risk (SR) determination, has been approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) under non-significant risk (NSR) determination and/or has been approved by local or regional Ethics Committee,  the study is subject to factors beyond a manufacturer’s control, including, but not limited to the fact that the institutional review board at a given clinical site might not approve the study, might decline to renew approval which is required annually, or might suspend or terminate the study before the study has been completed. There is no assurance that a clinical study at any given site will progress as anticipated; the interim results of a study may not be satisfactory leading the sponsor or others to terminate the study, there may be an insufficient number of patients who qualify for the study or who agree to participate in the study or the investigator at the site may have priorities other than the study.  Also, there can be no assurance that the clinical study will provide sufficient evidence to assure regulatory authorities that the product is safe, effective and performs as intended as a prerequisite for granting market clearance. See “Clinical Trials” above for clinical trials performed to date.

Post-Clearance Matters
Even if the FDA or other non-US regulatory authorities approve or clear a device, they may limit its intended uses in such a way that manufacturing and distributing the device may not be commercially feasible. After clearance or approval to market is given, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, upon the occurrence of certain events, are authorized under various circumstances to withdraw the clearance or approval or require changes to a device, its manufacturing process or its labeling or additional proof that regulatory requirements have been met.
A manufacturer of a device approved through the premarket approval application process is not permitted to make changes to the device which affects its safety or effectiveness without first submitting a supplement application to its premarket approval application and obtaining FDA clearance for that supplement.  In some instances, the FDA may require a clinical trial to support a supplement application.  A manufacturer of a device cleared through a 510(k) submission or a 510(k)+ “de-novo” submission must submit another premarket notification if it intends to make a change or modification in the device that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, such as a significant change or modification in design, material, chemical composition, energy source or manufacturing process.  Any change in the intended uses of a premarket approval application device or a 510(k) device requires an approval supplement or cleared premarket notification.  Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported, as well as certain FDA export requirements.
Mobile Medical Applications Guidance
On September 23, 2013, the FDA issued final guidance for developers of mobile medical applications, or apps, which are software programs that run on mobile communication devices and perform the same functions as traditional medical devices.  The guidance outlines the FDA’s tailored approach to mobile apps. The FDA plans to exercise enforcement discretion (meaning it will not enforce requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act) for the majority of mobile apps as they pose minimal risk to consumers.  The FDA plans to focus its regulatory oversight on a subset of mobile medical apps that present a greater risk to patients if they do not work as intended.  The FDA is focusing its oversight on mobile medical apps that:

● | are intended to be used as an accessory to a regulated medical device – for example, an application that allows a health care professional to make a specific diagnosis by viewing a medical image from a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) on a smart mobile device or a mobile tablet; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | transform a mobile platform into a regulated medical device – for example, an application that turns a smart mobile device into an electrocardiography (ECG) machine to detect abnormal heart rhythms or determine if a patient is experiencing a heart attack.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ongoing Regulation by FDA
Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:

● | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | quality system regulation, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the product life-cycle;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses, and other requirements related to promotional activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26




● | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that may present a risk to health; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products, rescinding previously granted 510(k) clearances or withdrawing previously granted PMA approvals.
We may be subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If, as a result of these inspections, the FDA determines that our or our subcontractor’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product clearance, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing and selling operations.
Ongoing Regulation by International Regulators
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country.
In order to maintain the right to affix the CE Mark to sell medical devices in the European Union, an annual surveillance audit in the company premises and, if needed, at major subcontractors’ premises needs to be carried out by the notified body.  Additionally, European Directives dictate the following requirements:

● | Vigilance system, which requires the manufacturer to immediately notify the relevant Competent Authority when a company product has been involved in an incident that led to a death; led to a serious injury or serious deterioration in the state of health of a patient, user or another person; or might have led to death, serious injury or serious deterioration in health; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Post-market surveillance including a documented procedure to review experience gained from devices on the market and to implement any necessary corrective action, commensurate with nature and risks involved with the product.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the regulatory agency, which may include any of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of our current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, refusing our request for renewing clearance and/or registration of our products or granting clearance/registration for new products.
State Licensure Requirements
Several states require that Durable Medical Equipment (“DME”) providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states require that DME providers maintain an in-state location. If these rules are determined to be applicable to us and if we were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state.
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for, or to induce the:

● | referral of a person;
--+----------------------

27




● | furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the extent we are required to comply with these regulations, it is possible that regulatory authorities could allege that we have not complied, which could subject us to sanction.  Noncompliance with the federal anti-kickback legislation can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, as well as civil and criminal penalties, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law,” which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services,” including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs.
Federal False Claims Act
The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved.  In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies.  Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the number of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person.
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
The Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the Federal healthcare programs.
State Fraud and Abuse Provisions
Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims acts. A determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Administrative Simplification of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, mandated the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the healthcare industry. Ensuring the privacy and security of patient information is one of the key factors driving the legislation.
Intellectual Property
Patent applications
On May 8, 2011, certain of our founders filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Application No. PCT/IL2011/000369, titled “Fluids Testing Apparatus and Methods of Use.”  This PCT claimed priority from two 

28



preceding U.S. provisional applications filed by our founders, with the earliest priority date being May 9, 2010. The PCT application was transferred to us by our founders on October 27, 2011.
This application covers the novel blood glucose measurement device, comprising the glucose meter; and an adaptor that connects the glucose meter to a smart-phone to receive power supply and data display, storage, and analysis.  A PCT search report and written opinion on patentability that we received from World Intellectual Property Organization (known as WIPO) that included only two “Y” citations and one additional non-relevant reference.  Corresponding national applications of our PCT were filed in the U.S., Europe, Japan, China, Australia and Israel.
On May 1, 2014, we announced the receipt of a U.S. Notice of Allowance for a key patent relating to how the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System draws power from and transmits data to a smartphone via the audio jack port. This patent was issued as U.S. Patent No. 8,797,180 in August 2014, and in August2015, we received U.S. patent (No. 9,125,549) that broadened our registered patent No. 8,797,180 to include testing of other bodily fluids through an audio jack connection. We believe these early patents represent critical intellectual property recognition and a significant initial validation of our intellectual property efforts. Further, a corresponding European patent was granted to us in May 2016, as European patent No. 2569622 for testing of fluids through an audio jack connection. An additional corresponding patent was granted in Israel in April 2016. In February 2016 we were granted U.S. patent No. 9,257,038, which is a further Continuation application connected to the U.S. patent No. 8,797,180, this new patent enhanced the way the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System communicates with the end user’s smartphone devices.
In November 11, 2017, U.S. patent No. 9,832,301 titled “Systems and methods for adjusting power levels on a monitoring device” was granted. This patent enhances the way the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System communicates with users’ smartphone devices. This family includes a corresponding pending application in China.
Additionally, we recently received U.S. patent No. 10,445,072 that enables optical communication between the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System and the end user’s smartphone devices.
Additional patent applications are in the process of being discussed and developed, and we believe that we have a rich potential pipeline of future technologies that we intend to develop.
For example, we are further seeking to develop and protect new intellectual property around future generations of our hardware and software with the goal of achieving enhanced functionality, user interface, data usability, cyber protection, and artificial intelligence enhancement.
In early 2022, we acquired Physimax and acquired the following patent – US 10,709,374 B2 titled “System and Method for Assessment of Musculoskeletal Profile of a Target Individual.”

Utility Models
We have been granted Utility Models for our core invention in Japan and Germany.
Other intangible assets
As the number of Dario users grows, an ever-growing amount of data is being collected from diabetic patients, including their blood sugar levels, meal compositions, routines, physical exercise (intensity and duration) as well as many other factors, and lately also blood pressure data, which are all useful for creating meaningful correlations between these factors and insulin use.  We expect that this database will be highly valuable and may be capitalized in many ways. The accumulation of this type of know-how and related algorithms are protected as trade secrets using specialized confidentiality protocols.
Competition
 In recent years, a number of digitally supported solutions have emerged to manage diabetes and other chronic conditions. Competitors are developing new technologies rapidly and, in some cases, are also expanding to manage other chronic conditions. In this crowded field, our success is predicated on our flexibility to adapt to evolving customer requirements in digital health and superior execution in engagement, retention and clinical outcomes in a manner that delivers clear return on investment in required time-horizons and in complex, highly regulated business environments. We expect new entrants in the field and the emergence of novel technologies, as well as competition from larger technology platform players such as Amazon, Apple and Google. Dario’s competitors vary by intervention (devices, applications, coaching and analytics), by channel (health plan, pharma, provider, employer) and by condition (including, for example, diabetes, MSK, HTN, behavioral health and others). Certain of our competitors offer this integrated approach in varying degrees, including, among others, Hinge Health, Inc., Livongo Health Inc. (acquired by Teladoc Health Inc.), Omada Health, Inc., Vida Health, Inc. and Virta Health Corp. We believe that our competitors are comparatively disadvantaged along several axes:

● | Our competitors offer point solutions for a single condition (which model is unattractive to enterprise customers needing to manage multiple vendor relationships and who recognize that conditions frequently overlap in the same individual);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our competitors fail to share member-level data or granular reporting with partners, which prevents these partners from leveraging their own assets to support care;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitor applications have limited or minimal levels of personalization, where communications (or “nudge”) from the application may be somewhat personalized, but actual user experiences are heavily templated, and not personalized or dynamic;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Competitor applications are supported only by short term outcome data, as compared to our studies which cover a 2-year period and offer 8 years of direct-to-consumer data;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Failure of any one of our competitors to successfully engage and retain a substantial portion of the base population, as few have the direct-to-consumer experience or data required, resulting in frustrated customers who cannot realize promised cost savings;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customers of our competitors suffer an inadequate user experience, as evidenced by few app store reviews and low scores in Apple, Google and Amazon stores;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our competitors offer medical device-oriented approaches with delayed product update cadences, rather than our more agile, software-driven approaches that push out new products every few weeks;
