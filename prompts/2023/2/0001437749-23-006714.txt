Item 1. Business.
 
This business description should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”), which are incorporated herein by this reference.
 
Company Overview
 
Fluent, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Fluent,” or the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, is an industry leader in data-driven digital marketing services. We primarily perform customer acquisition services by operating highly scalable digital marketing campaigns, through which we connect our advertiser clients with consumers they are seeking to reach. We deliver data and performance-based marketing executions to our clients, which in 2022 included over 500 consumer brands, direct marketers and agencies across a wide range of industries, including Media & Entertainment, Financial Products & Services, Health & Wellness, Retail & Consumer and Staffing & Recruitment.
 
We attract consumers at scale to our owned digital media properties primarily through promotional offerings where they are rewarded for completing activities within the platforms. To register on our sites, consumers provide their names, contact information and opt-in permission to present them with relevant offers on behalf of our clients. Approximately 90% of these users engage with our media on their mobile devices or tablets. Our always-on, real-time capabilities enable users to access our media whenever and wherever they choose.
 
Once users have registered on our sites, we integrate our proprietary direct marketing technologies and analytics to engage them with surveys, polls, and other experiences, through which we learn about their lifestyles, preferences and purchasing histories. Based on these insights, we serve targeted, relevant offers to them on behalf of our clients. As new users register and engage with our sites and existing registrants re-engage, we believe the enrichment of our database expands our addressable client base and improves the effectiveness of our performance-based campaigns.
 
Since our inception, we have amassed a large, proprietary database of first-party, self-declared user information and preferences. We have consented permission to contact the majority of users in our database through multiple channels, such as email, home address, telephone, push notifications and SMS text messaging. We leverage this data in our performance offerings primarily to serve advertisements that we believe will be relevant to users based on the information they provide when they engage with our sites, and in our data offerings to provide our clients with users' contact information so that our clients may communicate with them directly. We may also leverage our existing database into new revenue streams, including utilization-based models, such as programmatic advertising and call centers.
 
We generate revenue by delivering measurable online marketing results to our clients. We differentiate ourselves from other marketing alternatives by our abilities to provide clients with a cost-effective and measurable return on advertising spend ("ROAS") (a measure of profitability of sales compared to the money spent on ads), to manage highly targeted and highly fragmented online media sources and to provide access to our owned digital media properties and technology platforms. We are predominantly paid on a negotiated or market-driven “per click,” “per lead,” or other “per action” basis that aligns with the customer acquisition cost targets of our clients. We bear the costs of sourcing traffic from publishers for our owned digital media properties that ultimately generate qualified clicks, leads, calls, app downloads or customers for our clients.
 
Through AdParlor Holdings, Inc. (“AdParlor”), we conduct our non-core business which offers clients various social media strategies through the planning and buying of media on different platforms.
 
Market Opportunity
 
According to eMarketer, aggregate spending on digital media exceeded the aggregate spending on offline media in the U.S. for the first time in 2019. Industry spending on digital media is projected by eMarketer to have exceeded $240 billion in 2022, representing approximately 70% of total media spend in the U.S., and is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 9.5% through 2025. Software-driven, programmatic ad-spending makes up a large and growing share of digital display ad spending. In 2019, more than 86% of U.S. display ad spending was transacted programmatically representing $61 billion of the digital display ad spending, and it is expected that will exceed 91% and $142 billion of the segment in 2023, according to eMarketer.
Key Challenges Facing our Clients
 
While performance-based pricing models dominate digital media spend, we believe that a significant portion of such spend represents an intermediary step in an advertiser’s process of procuring new customers, such as a click on a banner advertisement. According to The Nielsen Global Annual Marketing Report 2022, marketer’s confidence in their ability to measure full-funnel return on investment ("ROI") stands at just 54%. We believe advertisers are operating in an environment where greater accountability is being mandated and, therefore, are increasingly focused on the ability to precisely measure return on their media spend.
 
In addition, many companies seeking to learn more about their existing customers or target new customers either gather data themselves or purchase data to inform their advertising and marketing strategies. However, the data they obtain is often either not first-party, not sufficiently recent or sufficiently complete. Moreover, these companies may not have the ability to capture real-time signals that are indicated by a consumer’s behavior, even if it is observable. As a result, we believe many companies who offer products and services to consumers do not have ready access to accurate consumer data or timely alerts through which they could programmatically target their advertising, nor do they have the ability to resolve data sets and thereby confirm consumer identities or enrich data profiles.

Our Offerings and Solutions to Clients
 
We primarily provide performance marketing solutions to our clients based on their desired outcomes, or specific actions in their marketing funnels, including the submission of a registration form, an app installation, or a completed transaction. Our owned and operated media properties include Flash Rewards, The Smart Wallet, and Find Dream Jobs, among others. We believe our solutions are well-aligned with the needs and objectives of our clients, notably, due to our ability to provide them with measurability, scalability, and flexibility. In addition, by using the data consumers provide about themselves when registering on our sites, our advertiser clients are able to reach the precise audiences they are targeting through the modes of contact these consumers, who have opted to be marketed to, prefer and at the times they are most receptive to being contacted.
 
•  Performance Campaigns
 
For clients who seek the completion of certain actions by consumers, such as the submission of a registration form, the installation of a mobile app, or a trial subscription of a good or service, we provide performance campaigns that meet the criteria specified by the client.
 
We bear the cost and risk of paying various media sources to generate consumer traffic to our digital media properties or to media properties owned or operated by our clients, without the assurance of a subsequent revenue-generating event from such activity. By leveraging our scale and expertise in acquiring consumer traffic, we work with our clients to define billable events and pricing tolerances that meet both our and our clients' profitability objectives, the latter of which may be difficult for them to achieve themselves economically, if at all.
 
•  Consumer Data 
 
We also generate revenues by providing clients with qualifying customer data of consumers, who have opted to be marketed to, directly through means such as direct mail, email, telephone, messaging, and other channels. Our clients then use this customer data to conduct their own marketing campaigns. 
 
The data records we provide contain varying depths of user profiles, ranging from basic contact information to in-depth self-declared preferences and behaviors. We believe the scale and depth of first-party, self-declared information captured on our websites and reflected in our data profiles is a competitive advantage within the industry. Many other providers of consumer data offer data or information that is inferred from a consumer’s behavior but not directly observed or otherwise provided by a consumer. We believe our first-party data is more reliable and reflective of consumers' current interests and preferences.
 
•  Programmatic Data Offerings
 
Since 2018, we have been offering data sets pertaining to certain audience segments from our database in programmatic environments, thereby enabling advertisers, such as those in the healthcare industry, to leverage such data in an anonymized, privacy-minded manner to target high-intent prospects for their offerings. The programmatic data offering has grown considerably since its inception. Although still representing a small percentage of our overall revenue, we believe it represents a strategically significant and incremental revenue stream for our existing database.
 
•  Social Media Campaigns
 
Through AdParlor Holdings, Inc. we offer clients a sophisticated suite of social media strategy, planning and buying, along with highly tailored creative services.
 
•  Call Center Solutions
 
Through our Fluent Sales Solutions ("FSS") service, we maintain a contact center operation which serves as a marketplace to match consumers, we have sourced, to the needs of our advertising clients. Through FSS, we offer clients a high-value source of live call transfers and phone verified prospective customers for their businesses. Through this capability, we provide a positive and high-quality consumer experience enabling us to capture greater value from the leads we initially source.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths will continue to enable us to provide a compelling value proposition to our clients and drive differentiation of our offerings in the marketplace.
•Scale and Experience in Purchasing Media - Our ability to effectively access, at scale, channels and sources of media that supply consumer traffic to our media properties and those of our clients has been critical to our growth. Since our inception, we have deployed approximately $2 billion in media spend. Our team has gained knowledge and experience that we believe allows us to generate higher levels of profitability from given media sources, thereby enabling us to acquire media more competitively than others. This capability allows us to run thousands of campaigns simultaneously and cost-effectively for our clients, at acceptable media costs and margins to us.
•Proprietary and Innovative Technology Platform - We believe our internally developed technology platform is unique in the industry, having been purpose-built for performance marketing and developed with a mobile-first user experience in mind. Our platform deploys proprietary machine-learning capabilities to build upon our experience with various promotional offers, consumer segments and advertisers, through which we continuously optimize our digital marketing campaigns.
 
•Database of First-Party Consumer Information - We attract consumers to our owned media properties on a daily basis and collect demographic, behavioral and other data as they engage with our direct marketing experiences. This data is generated in real-time, as consumers respond to dynamically populated survey questions, thereby enabling targeted ads to be served in response. This data is also stored and analyzed and can be further enhanced as consumers return to our sites and declare and exhibit additional preferences and behaviors through additional surveying, allowing for the development of deeper insights and additional monetization opportunities.
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe that the performance marketing industry has significant opportunities for growth. Elements of our strategy include:
 
•Increasing Traffic Quality to Our Owned Digital Media Properties. As our business has grown, we have attracted larger and more sophisticated clients to our platform. To further increase our value proposition to clients and to fortify our leadership position in relation to the evolving regulatory landscape of our industry, we implemented a Traffic Quality Initiative ("TQI") in 2020 to remove lower quality customer traffic, including traffic that did not consistently meet regulatory standards from our platform. We have created a more sustainable foundation for our business by improving the quality of customer traffic we sourced to our media properties, with through increased user participation rates on our sites, leading to higher conversion rates and more 'name brand' advertiser clients, resulting in increased monetization and ultimately increasing revenue.
 
Through TQI, we have improved the quality of the customer traffic that we source ourselves and we demand the same from our suppliers. We believe these actions have and will continue to benefit the Company over time, providing the foundation to support sustainable long-term growth and positioning us as an industry leader.
 
We are also building out our influencer marketing capabilities to diversify our current internal media buys on social media platforms and capture available opportunities in the influencer market. According to the 2023 Influencer Marketing Benchmark Report, influencer marketing is estimated to grow to approximately $21.1 billion in 2023 and is expected to account for an increasing share of the marketing spend of a majority of companies. We believe that influencers will represent an increasing share of our paid media and by operating our own influencer network, we will be better able to ensure compliant operations, effectively manage our media spend by eliminating middlemen, and afford our clients access to our stable of influencers. 
 
•Increasing Monetization of Our Traffic. By presenting consumers with a broad array of offers particularly curated to their preferences, as informed by their responses to our surveys and our platform’s ad serving logic, we seek to facilitate transactions that are beneficial for the advertiser, the consumer and us. As we continue to improve consumer engagement on our platform, we expect to strengthen our relationships with existing advertisers and build new relationships with potential advertisers. We continuously enhance our product offerings for consumers and targeting capabilities for advertisers to ensure we are optimizing the value of our traffic.
•Developing and Enhancing Products that Increase the Quality of Our Offering to Consumers, Advertisers and Partners. Our product development efforts are intended to appeal to consumers, drive traffic, increase monetization and increase affiliate and partner opportunities. Examples of some areas on which our product development team is currently focused include designing new consumer-facing creative concepts, enhancing site experiences, developing mobile app products to expand our media footprint beyond our mobile web presence, and improving the reputation of our domains.
•Post-Transaction Ad Solutions. Leveraging our acquisition of True North Loyalty, LLC (“True North”), we have developed and launched an e-commerce post purchase ad serving solution to access a new pool of users for our advertiser clients. We deploy an “ad module” on the e-commerce website that offers a series of curated offers to users after check-out. We compensate our e-commerce partners by either sharing revenue proceeds or by remunerating them on an impression basis. Although we are still in an initial launch phase, we believe this ad solution will become a meaningful contributor to our operations.
Sales and Marketing
 
We generate new client sales primarily through our in-house sales team. We service established clients through our in-house account directors and managers, who seek to optimize results for and expand our business with these clients.
Our Competition
 
Our traditional competitors have been digital marketing and database marketing services providers, online and traditional media companies, and advertising agencies. We believe the competitive landscape is changing and becoming more complex. We believe our data and our ad serving and customer acquisition technologies enable our clients to better target, engage, qualify, and communicate with relevant consumers, in a more profitable manner than our competitors.
 
Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources, better name recognition and a larger customer base.

Concentration
 
We have an extensive list of clients across a wide range of industries. For the year ended December 31, 2022, a single long-standing advertiser client of the Company accounted for 22.1% of consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this same client accounted for 11.7% of the Company's consolidated revenue.
Acquisitions
 
•  On July 1, 2019 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of AdParlor Holdings, Inc.
 
•  On April 1, 2020 we acquired a fifty percent (50%) interest in Winopoly, LLC, and acquired the remaining fifty percent (50%) interest on September 1, 2021.
 
•  On January 1, 2022 we acquired a one-hundred percent (100%)  interest in True North Loyalty, LLC.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
We rely on trade secret, trademark and copyright law, confidentiality agreements, and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. With respect to our trademarks, we maintain a portfolio of perpetual common law and federally registered trademark rights across several brands and domains relating to our business units, products, services, and solutions. We claim copyright protection in our original content that is published on our websites and included in our marketing materials.
Regulatory Matters
 
Our business is subject to a significant number of federal, state, local and international laws, rules, and regulations applicable to online or digital advertising, commercial email marketing, telemarketing and text messaging. We are also subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding data collection, privacy and data security, intellectual property ownership and infringement, sweepstakes and promotions and taxation, among others. Some of our clients operate in regulated industries, such as financial services, credit repair, gambling, consumer and mortgage lending, healthcare and medical services, health insurance including Medicare Advantage and related Medicare insurance plans and secondary education, and, to the extent applicable, we must comply with the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to marketing activities in those industries. We own and operate consumer facing websites in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia and are subject to the laws, rules, and regulations of those countries as they impact our operations.
 
These laws, rules, and regulations, which generally are designed to regulate and prevent deceptive practices in advertising, online marketing, and telemarketing, protect individual privacy rights and prevent the misuse and unauthorized disclosure of personal information, are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws, rules, and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.
 
We have been involved in investigations with federal and state regulators over our practices including with the New York Attorney General (“NYAG”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General (“PAAG”). These investigations and claims have been and will likely continue to be expensive to defend, will divert management’s time away from our operations and may result in changes to our business practices that adversely affect our results of operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings for further discussion of the impacts of these proceedings and various laws, rules, and regulations on our business.

Human Capital
 
Fluent is dedicated to certain core principles and values which include continuous learning, pace, collaboration, and high-performance. Fluent is committed to providing our employees with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation and comprehensive medical and wellness benefits. We embrace challenges and welcome opportunities to make improvements in our corporate culture and employee benefits. As we continue to evolve and grow as an organization, we are dedicated to creating an inclusive and safe work environment where each person feels they belong and add a fresh, unique perspective to our business and culture. 
 
We have been the recipients of many awards for our corporate culture including regularly being on Crains’s Best Places to Work for in recent years.
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 275 employees, of which 272 were full-time employees. This represents an increase of 3.8% over the number of employees as of December 31, 2021. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization, and none are party to any collective bargaining agreement with us. We have not experienced any work stoppages and strive to maintain a positive relationship with our team. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began to subside during 2022, we modified our policy to a hybrid model to encourage people to come into the office. While we believe we adapted well to a work-from-home model, we are now focused on a hybrid strategy based around flexibility and collaboration. We have demonstrated that we can be fully remote without business interruption, but we have implemented a flexible hybrid model as we know the importance of flexibility and in person collaboration. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – “Unfavorable global economic conditions, including lingering health and safety concerns from the pandemic, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.” and “If we lose the services of any of our key personnel, it could adversely affect our business.” for further information about the risks of our hybrid work model.
 
Investing in our People
 
Competition in the recruitment of top talent within our industry remains constant and our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire, motivate, and retain exceptional colleagues across the business inclusive of sales and marketing, executive, administrative, creative, and technical colleagues. As the business evolves, we continue to source talent to complement the existing team with different strengths, experience, and ideas. Additionally, over the past few years we have worked to support internal mobility for those who have excelled in their roles and are looking to gain new experience in other areas of the business that align with their individual career goals. As a performance-based organization, Fluent offers generous and competitive salaries and bonus/commission plans to both attract and retain our employees. We match up to 4% of employees’ contributions in their 401(k) to help our employees plan for their futures. We reward positive performance and celebrate our employees for their persistent drive to succeed.
 
We also prioritize the health and well-being of our people, who we want to be their best and authentic selves both personally and professionally. We offer multiple health insurance plans to choose from, on-demand wellness sessions, and mental health resources like virtual and in-person therapy, coaching, mental wellness screenings, and self-help exercises.
 
We encourage curiosity and provide our people with the tools and resources to learn and grow. From internal Fluent University courses, company-wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) workshops, and corporate She Runs It memberships, we offer continuous opportunities for personal and professional development. In 2022 through these courses, we created approximately 1,800 hours of learning for our employees. We also launched LinkedIn Learning in 2022 to provide colleagues with real time access to top content to help them develop areas of focus to fuel their growth.
 
To ensure our people take time to recharge, we offer discretionary time off, that provides vacation days throughout the year in addition to our 13 paid company holidays. Our goal is to create a flexible work environment that fuels creativity and results.
 
Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI)
 
We are constantly striving to make Fluent a more inclusive and compassionate place to work. We make a concerted effort to post roles and source top candidates to present a diverse candidate slate for our hiring teams.  Our dedicated DEI team is designed to create opportunities for connection, education, and service that drive reflection, empathy, and positive change at Fluent – as well as in our communities and industry. Fluent continues to invest in our colleagues by providing DEI trainings and creating opportunities to connect to discuss real events.  In 2022, our Women Leader’s Group sponsored their second mentorship program which has now increased to 54 participants.  We are proud to foster a learning and coaching culture to support the development and growth for all of our employees.
 
Additionally, at Fluent, giving back is at our core. We’ve always been strong believers in paying it forward. From the top down, our people are generous, compassionate, and eager to make real impact. We organize company-wide community service days, match employees’ donations to the causes they value and support, and regularly come together as a team to help those in need. In 2022, we partnered with the Hope Program so that our employees could share their expertise to help people develop their interview skills to secure employment. People in the Hope Program consists of individuals facing deep structural barriers to employment, including histories with the criminal legal system, current and/or past homelessness, substance abuse disorders, low educational attainment, and more. In 2022 we partnered again with Daymaker, and through this partnership, the Fluent team donated gifts from across the United States and Canada to give gifts to children in need accompanied with personal holiday notes. We believe these service-based activities and donation matches help our employees stay engaged with, and give back to their communities which creates positive change.
