Ltd., Ruiyu Automotive (Beijing) Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Faran Automotive Technology Co., Ltd., each of which was organized in the PRC. The discussion of FF’s business and the electric vehicle industry below is qualified by, and should be read in conjunction with, the discussion of the risks related to FF’s business and industry detailed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Company Overview

FF is a California-based global shared intelligent mobility ecosystem company with a vision to disrupt the automotive industry.

With headquarters in Los Angeles, California, the Company designs and engineers next-generation intelligent, connected, electric vehicles. FF intends to start manufacturing vehicles at its production facility in Hanford, California, with additional future production capacity needs addressed through a contract manufacturing partner in South Korea. FF is also exploring other potential contract manufacturing options in addition to the contract manufacturer in South Korea. The Company has additional engineering, sales, and operational capabilities in China and is exploring opportunities for potential manufacturing capabilities in China through a joint venture or other arrangement.
Since its founding, the Company has created major innovations in technology and products, and a user centered business model. We believe these innovations will enable FF to set new standards in luxury and performance that will enhance quality of life and redefine the future of intelligent mobility.
FFIE is a holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware. As a holding company with no material operations of its own, FFIE conducts its operations through its operating subsidiaries. We currently have a majority of our operations in the U.S. conducted through our U.S.-domiciled operating subsidiaries. We also operate our business in the People’s Republic of China and plan to have significant operations in the future in both Mainland China and Hong Kong (together, “PRC” or “China”) through our subsidiaries organized in the PRC (collectively, the “PRC Subsidiaries”). Investors in FFIE’s Class A Common Stock (the “Class A Common Stock,” and with FFIE’s Class B Common Stock, the “Common Stock”) are investors solely of FFIE, a Delaware holding company. There are various risks associated with our current operating presence in China and the potential expansion of our operations in China (including Hong Kong), which is subject to political and economic influence from China. Recently, the Chinese government initiated a series of regulatory actions and made statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies that seek to conduct offshore securities offering or to be listed overseas, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. Since these statements and regulatory actions are new, it is highly uncertain how soon legislative or administrative regulation-making bodies will respond and what existing or new laws or regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations will be modified or promulgated if any, and the potential impact such modified or new laws and regulations will have on our business operations, our ability to accept foreign investments and to maintain FFIE’s listing on a U.S. exchange. The Chinese government may intervene or influence the operations of our PRC Subsidiaries, or at any time exert more control over offerings conducted overseas and foreign investment in China-based issuers  in accordance with PRC laws and regulations, which could result in a material change in our operations and/or a material reduction in the value of our Class A Common Stock and warrants. Additionally, the governmental and regulatory interference could significantly limit or completely hinder our and our investors’ ability to offer or continue to offer our shares of Class A Common Stock to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless. For a detailed description of risks related to our PRC operations, see “Risk Factors – Risks Related to FF’s Operations in China.”

FF’s B2C (business-to-consumer) passenger vehicle pipeline over the next five years includes the FF 91 series, the FF 81 series, and the FF 71 series, each designed to target different passenger vehicle segments. In addition to passenger vehicles, and leveraging its VPA and other proprietary technology, FF plans to produce a Smart Last Mile Delivery (“SLMD”) vehicle to address the high growth last mile delivery market.

Each of the three passenger vehicle series is planned in two different configurations (the FF 91 will also come in a limited edition model). At the top end, the “Futurist” configurations will drive FF’s core brand values (design, superior driving experience, and personalized user experience enabled through FF’s unique I.A.I technologies) to the fullest. Offering multiple configurations allows FF to participate in a wide price range within each vehicle series.

Based on certain management assumptions, including the timely receipt of $38.4 million to $58.4 million of additional funding, which commitments have been secured on February 3, 2023, where the Company entered into an Amendment No. 6 to Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”) with FF Simplicity as administrative and collateral agent and Senyun, FF Top, FF Simplicity, FF Prosperity, Acuitas and other purchasers, and approval by stockholders of the proposal to increase FFIE’s authorized shares of Class A Common Stock from 815,000,000 to 1,690,000,000, increasing the total authorized shares from 900,000,000 to 1,775,000,000, which approval was obtained during the special meeting of stockholders held on February 28, 2023, timely completion of key equipment installation and commissioning work at the ieFactory California in Hanford, California, suppliers meeting their commitments on program deliverables including parts, the implementation and effectiveness of certain expense reduction and payment delay measures, and timely and successful testing and certification, FF expects start of production of the FF 91 Futurist at the end of March 2023, coming off the line in early April 2023, and deliveries to users anticipated to begin before the end of April 2023. Please refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to FF’s Business and Industry – FF’s vehicles are in development and the delivery of FF’s first vehicle has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant delays” for a discussion on risks and uncertainties related to the expected production and delivery. Toward that goal, FF has completed most of its vehicle development milestones, and recently announced Milestone #6, completion of key equipment installation work at the ieFactory California in Hanford, California. The FF 91 series is designed to compete with Maybach, Bentley Bentayga, Lamborghini Urus, Ferrari Purosangue, Mercedes S-Class, Rolls Royce Spectre, Porsche Taycan, BMW 7-Series, etc. In addition to the FF 91 series, FF has planned the following passenger vehicles:


● | FF 81 series, FF’s second passenger vehicle, is envisioned to be a premium mass market electric connected vehicle positioned to compete against Tesla Model S and Model X, Nio ES8, BMW 5-series, and similar vehicles.


● | FF 71 series, FF’s mass market passenger vehicle, plans to integrate connectivity and advanced technology into a smaller vehicle size and positioned to compete against Tesla Model 3 and Model Y, BMW 3-series, and similar vehicles.

Product Positioning 

All FF passenger vehicles will share common brand “DNA” of:


● | Intelligence, Internet and connectivity;


● | modern design: styling;


● | superior driving experience: leading power, performance and driving range; and


● | personalized user experience: space, comfort and internet experience

The flagship FF 91 series with its recent product and technology upgrade to PT Gen 2.0 will define the FF brand DNA. This DNA will carry over to FF 81 and FF 71 series vehicles at lower price points. With such brand DNA, FF believes its products will be ahead of competition in their respective segments in terms of design, driving experience, interior comfort, connectivity, and user experience.

Robust Hybrid Manufacturing Strategy 

To implement a capital light business model, FF has adopted a hybrid global manufacturing strategy consisting of its refurbished manufacturing facility in Hanford, California and a collaboration with Myoung Shin, a contract manufacturing partner in South Korea. FF is also exploring other potential contract manufacturing options in addition to the contract manufacturer agreement in South Korea. The Company is also exploring the possibility of manufacturing capacity in China through a joint venture or other arrangement.

As of the date hereof:


● | FFIE leased a 1.1 million square foot manufacturing facility in Hanford, California with an expected production capacity of approximately 10,000 vehicles per year; and


● | FFIE entered into a definitive contract manufacturing and supply agreement with Myoung Shin Co., Ltd. (“Myoung Shin”), a South Korea-based automotive manufacturer and parts supplier, to manufacture the Company’s second vehicle, the FF 81. The agreement has an initial term of nine years from the start of production of the FF 81. Pursuant to the agreement, Myoung Shin shall maintain sufficient manufacturing capabilities and capacity to supply FF 81 vehicles to FF in accordance with the Company’s forecasts and purchase orders. FF and Myoung Shin will each manufacture and supply certain FF 81 parts that Myoung Shin will use in the manufacture and assembly of FF 81 vehicles.

Distribution Model

FF management anticipates making its first passenger vehicles available in the U.S., followed shortly thereafter by a rollout in China. Expansion of sales to Europe may begin as early as 2024, and additional markets may be added thereafter. FF plans to utilize a direct sales model integrating online and offline sales channels to drive sales and user (including customers, drivers, passengers of FF vehicles) operations to continuously create value. FF’s offline sales are planned through FF’s self-owned stores as well as FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms. The self-owned stores are expected to help establish the FF brand, while the partner-owned stores and showrooms will enable expansion of the sales and distribution network without substantial capital investment by FF.
FF’s Competitive Strengths 

FF’s products, technology, team and business model provide strong competitive differentiation.

FF’s proprietary VPA 

FF’s proprietary VPA is a skateboard-like platform that incorporates the critical components of an electric vehicle, and can be sized to accommodate various motor and powertrain configurations. This flexible modular design supports a range of consumer and commercial vehicles and facilitates rapid development of multiple vehicle programs to reduce cost and time to market.

Projected product performance with industry-leading propulsion technology

FF’s propulsion system includes an industry-leading inverter design and proprietary drive propulsion system. FF’s proprietary FF Echelon Inverter has the technological advantage of driving a large amount of current in a small space using proprietary parallel Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (“IGBTs”), achieving low inverter losses and high efficiency. The propulsion system has high torque accuracy with fast transient response. The electric motor drive units are fully integrated with the inverter, transmission and control unit to create industry-leading volume and design efficiency. Propelled by an integrated FF designed powertrain, FF’s vehicles can achieve leading horsepower, efficiency, and acceleration performance as recently attested by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and California’s Air Resources Board (“CARB”) by confirming a range of 381 miles on a single charge and internally measured acceleration of 2.27 seconds from 0 to 60 mph for the FF 91.

Please refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to FF’s Business and Industry – FF’s vehicles are in development and the delivery of FF’s first vehicle has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant delays” for a discussion on risks and uncertainties related to the expected commercial production and delivery.

Electric Vehicle Industry Overview and Market Opportunity 

The electric vehicle industry is poised for explosive growth. Based on the Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022 report, a long-term forecast published by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (“BNEF Report”), which forecasts that passenger electric vehicle sales in the U.S., Europe, China and other regions in the world could grow to a total of approximately 20.6 million vehicles in 2025, from 6.6 million vehicles in 2021, and then continue to grow rapidly.

Driven by China’s new energy vehicle (“NEV”) credit and European CO2 regulations as well as city policies restricting new internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicle sales, electric vehicle sales in China and Europe are estimated to exceed 65% of all passenger electric vehicle sales by 2030, according to the BNEF Report. In addition, since many U.S. households have the infrastructure to install home charging, they are ideal adopters of electric vehicles. According to the BNEF Report, by 2040, over three-quarters of all new passenger vehicles sold will be electric, with markets in China and parts of Europe achieving even higher penetration. For commercial electric vehicles, demand for electric small vans, and trucks are expected to rise quickly, with the U. S., Europe, and China markets expanding faster than the overall market, according to the BNEF Report. In addition, the report notes that light-duty commercial vehicles will see the greatest surge in demand for electric drivetrains among all commercial vehicles. FF believes its U.S. and China dual-home market strategy, as well as its innovative DNA, strong technology portfolio, and emphasis on design, driving experience and personalized user experience will position it well in the passenger electric vehicle segments in these markets. By leveraging the scalable design and modularity of FF’s variable platform architecture, FF is well-positioned to capitalize on growing demands for light, commercial electric vehicles. Additionally, FF’s robust vehicle engineering capabilities and extensive portfolio of technologies offer significant future licensing and strategic partnership opportunities.

Key Drivers for Electric Vehicle Market Growth 

Several important factors are contributing to the popularity of electric vehicles, in both the passenger electric vehicle and light-duty commercial vehicle segments. FF believes the following factors will continue to drive growth in these markets:
Increasing Environmental Awareness and Tightening Emission Regulations

Environmental concerns have resulted in tightening emission regulations globally, and there is a broad consensus that further emission reductions will require increased electrification in the automotive industry. The cost of regulatory compliance for ICE powertrains is rising sharply due to the natural limitations of traditional ICE technologies. In response, global original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) are aggressively shifting their strategies toward electric vehicles. At the same time, consumers are more concerned about the impact of goods they purchase, both on their personal health and the environment. As consumer awareness increases, zero emission transportation has become a popular and widely advocated urban lifestyle which has accelerated further development of the electric vehicle market. Consumer pressure can also be seen in the commercial 
electric vehicle market. Being encouraged by their customers to reduce their carbon footprints, retailers, logistics companies, and other corporations are highly incentivized to transition their existing fleets or new vehicle purchases toward electric vehicles.
Decreasing Battery and Electric Vehicle Ownership Costs

Battery and battery-related costs generally represent the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The falling price of lithium-ion batteries is expected to be among the most important factors affecting electric vehicle penetration in the future. Additionally, the average battery energy density is expected to increase with continuous improvements in battery chemistries, improved materials, advanced engineering, and manufacturing efficiencies. With improvements in battery technology and economies of scale, battery production costs (translated to electric vehicle ownership costs) should continue to decrease. The BNEF Report states that the average lithium-ion battery price has fallen by 89% from 2010 to 2021 to $131/kWh. They project the cost of lithium-ion batteries will fall below $100/kWh by 2024 and continue to decline as advancements in manufacturing and technology continue. According to the BNEF Report, price parity between electric vehicles and ICE is expected to be reached by the mid-2020s in most vehicle segments, subject to variation between geographies.
Strong Regulatory Push 

An increasing number of countries are encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles or a shift away from fossil-fuel-powered vehicles. For example, in the U.S., both states and municipalities have begun to roll out legislation banning combustion engines, with California mandating that every new passenger car and truck sold to be zero-emission by 2035, and every new medium and heavy-duty truck sold be zero-emission by 2045. Fifteen additional U.S. states and Washington, D.C. have announced they intend to follow California’s lead in transitioning all sales of heavy-duty trucks, vans and buses to zero-emission, with potentially more to follow in coming years. In China, the focused regulatory push has been one of the strongest drivers of NEV penetration. In recent years, the Chinese government implemented a series of favorable policies encouraging the purchase of electric vehicles and construction of electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Since 2015, the Chinese regulatory authorities have provided subsidies to purchasers of electric vehicles. Although previous purchase subsidies were reduced in China by approximately half in 2019, the Chinese government has continued to provide subsidies for charging infrastructure construction. Since 2016, the Chinese central finance department has been incentivizing certain local governments with funds and subsidies for the construction and operation of charging facilities and other relevant charging infrastructure, such as charging stations and battery swap stations. Europe, UK, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Sweden have all announced plans to phase out combustion engines in some form or fashion by 2030. These legislative tailwinds have already begun to force some legacy OEMs toward electrification, creating a strong need for a modular, flexible, and cost-efficient electric vehicle solution, which will increase competition in the alternative energy vehicle industry.
Growth of Electric “Shared Mobility”

According to the BNEF Report, despite the significant near-term impact from COVID-19, the global shared mobility fleet (i.e., ride-hailing and car-sharing) is expected to represent more than 15% of the total kilometers traveled by passenger vehicles by 2040, up from less than 5% in 2019. Bloomberg data also predicted that due to electric vehicles’ lower operating costs, they are anticipated to account for over 75% of shared mobility vehicles by 2040, representing a dramatic increase from current low single digit penetration. At the same time, as vehicle consumers move to rely upon shared mobility fleets, and view ride-hailing and car-sharing as a service, such trends may partially offset passenger vehicle demand growth.
Corporate History and Milestones

FF U.S., the Company’s primary U.S. operating subsidiary, was incorporated and founded in the State of California in May 2014. In July 2014, LeSee Automotive (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“LeSee Beijing”), which was previously the Company’s primary Chinese operating entity, was formed in China.

To facilitate global investment of FF’s business and operations in different jurisdictions, FF established a Cayman Islands holding company structure for the entities within the group. As part of these efforts, Smart Technology Holdings Ltd. (formerly known as FF Global Holdings Ltd.) was incorporated on May 23, 2014 in the Cayman Islands, which directly or indirectly owned and/or controlled 100% of the shareholding of all operating subsidiaries in the group. In March 2017, FF established FF Automotive (China) Co., Ltd., as a Chinese wholly-foreign-owned entity (“WFOE”). As part of a broader corporate reorganization, and to facilitate third-party investment, FF incorporated its top-level holding company, FF Intelligent Mobility Global Holdings Ltd. (formerly known as Smart King Ltd.), in the Cayman Islands in November 2017, as the parent company of Smart Technology Holdings Ltd. To enable effective control over FF’s Chinese operating entity and its subsidiaries 
without direct equity ownership, in November 2017, the WFOE entered into a series of contractual arrangements (“VIE contractual arrangements”) with LeSee Beijing and LeSee Zhile Technology Co., Ltd., which previously held 100% of LeSee Beijing. The VIE contractual arrangement enabled FF to exercise effective control over LeSee Beijing and its subsidiaries, to receive substantially all of the economic benefits of such entities, and to have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests in LeSee Beijing. The VIE contractual arrangements were adjusted in the past three years and were terminated on August 5, 2020. LeSee Beijing is currently owned 99% by the WFOE.

The organizational chart below shows FFIE’s operating subsidiaries* as of the date hereof:


 
* | Excludes subsidiaries with immaterial operations. FF Hong Kong Holding Limited is a holding company subsidiary organized in Hong Kong. As of the date hereof, LeSEE Automotive (Beijing) Co. Ltd., a subsidiary organized in China, has immaterial operations.

PRC Subsidiaries
FFIE is a holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware. “FF U.S.”, FF’s primary U.S. operating subsidiary, was incorporated and founded in the State of California in May 2014. We refer to all our subsidiaries organized in China (including Hong Kong) collectively as the “PRC Subsidiaries.” A complete list of our subsidiaries is set forth in Exhibit 21.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of February 27, 2023, our only operating subsidiaries in China (including Hong Kong) are FF Automotive (China) Co. Ltd., Ruiyu Automotive (Beijing) Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Faran Automotive Technology Co., Ltd., each of which was organized in the PRC.
How Cash is Transferred Through Our Corporate Organization
The PRC has currency and capital transfer regulations that require us to comply with certain requirements for the movement of capital in and out of the PRC. FFIE is able to transfer cash (U.S. Dollars) to the PRC Subsidiaries through capital contributions (increasing FFIE’s capital investment in the PRC Subsidiaries). FFIE may receive cash or assets declared as dividends from the PRC Subsidiaries. The PRC Subsidiaries can transfer funds to each other when necessary, by way of intercompany loans in the following manners:
•FF Hong Kong Holding Limited, as the holding company of all the other PRC Subsidiaries, can transfer cash to any PRC Subsidiary through capital contribution. We note Hong Kong’s banking system is outside PRC mainland’s banking system. As a result, when FF Hong Kong Holding Limited transfers cash to a PRC Subsidiary, it is required to follow the SAFE (as defined below) process and regulation.
•FF Hong Kong Holding Limited, as the holding company of all the other PRC Subsidiaries, may receive cash or assets declared as dividends from the other PRC Subsidiaries.
•Among PRC Subsidiaries other than FF Hong Kong Holding Limited, one PRC Subsidiary can provide funds through intercompany loan to another PRC Subsidiary and each such PRC Subsidiary is required to follow the rules of China Banking Regulatory Commission and other relevant Chinese authorities. Additionally, one PRC Subsidiary can transfer cash to its subsidiary through capital contribution, and any PRC Subsidiary may receive cash or assets declared as dividends from any of its subsidiaries.
During 2019, FF Inc., a U.S.-based subsidiary incorporated in California, issued a loan to FF Hong Kong Holding Limited, a holding company subsidiary established in Hong Kong, in the aggregate amount of $1.2 million, which was the only transaction that involved the transfer of cash or assets throughout our corporate structure during 2019. During 2020, LeSee Automotive (Beijing) Co. Ltd., a PRC Subsidiary, assigned to Legacy FF its obligation to pay certain notes issued by a third party in the aggregate principal and accrued interest amount of $26.5 million. Also during 2020, Smart Technology Holdings Ltd., a subsidiary incorporated in the Cayman Islands, transferred to FF Hong Kong Holding Limited $1.7 million in cash, in the aggregate, by way of capital contributions to fund the PRC Subsidiaries’ operations. During 2021, Smart Technology Holdings Ltd. transferred to FF Hong Kong Holding Limited $32.1 million, in the aggregate, by way of capital contributions to fund the operations of the PRC Subsidiaries, including $10.0 million proceeds from the sale of PIPE Shares. In August 2021, Legacy FF extended a loan of $50.0 million to FF Automotive (Zhuhai) Co. Ltd., a PRC Subsidiary, for the purpose of acquiring a technology license agreement with a third party. We transferred cash or assets of $9.1 million from Smart Technology Holdings Ltd. to FF Hong Kong Holding Limited during the fourth quarter of 2021. In 2022 and 2023 to date, FF U.S. extended loans in an aggregated amount of $8.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively, to FF Hong Kong Holding Limited to fund the operations of the PRC Subsidiaries. We will continue to assess the PRC Subsidiaries’ requirements to fund their operations and intend to effect additional contributions as appropriate. As of February 27, 2023, our only operating subsidiaries in China (including Hong Kong) are FF Automotive (China) Co. Ltd., Ruiyu Automotive (Beijing) Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Faran Automotive Technology Co., Ltd., each of which was organized in the PRC. The PRC Subsidiaries have not transferred cash or other assets to FFIE, including by way of dividends. FFIE does not currently plan or anticipate transferring cash or other assets from our operations in China to any non-Chinese entity.
Capital contributions to PRC companies are mainly governed by the Company Law and Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China, and the dividends and distributions from the PRC Subsidiaries are subject to regulations and restrictions of the PRC on dividends and payment to parties outside of the PRC. Applicable PRC law permits payment of dividends to FFIE by our PRC Subsidiaries only out of their net income, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Our operating PRC Subsidiaries are required to set aside a portion of their net income, if any, each year to fund general reserves for appropriations until such reserves have reached 50% of the relevant entity’s registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. A PRC company is not permitted to distribute any profits until any losses from prior fiscal years have been offset. Profits retained from prior fiscal years may be distributed together with distributable profits from the current fiscal year. In addition, registered share capital and capital reserve accounts are also restricted from withdrawal in the PRC, up to the amount of net assets held in each operating subsidiary.
PRC Restrictions on Foreign Exchange and Transfer of Cash
Under PRC laws, if certain procedural requirements are satisfied, the payment of current account items, including profit distributions and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies between entities, across borders, and to U.S. investors without prior approval from State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the “SAFE”) or its local branches. However, where Chinese Yuan (“CNY”) is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies, approval from or registration with SAFE or its authorized banks is required. The PRC government may take measures at its discretion from time to time to restrict access to foreign currencies for current account or capital account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents our PRC Subsidiaries from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy their foreign currency demands, our PRC Subsidiaries may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to FFIE. Further, we cannot assure you that new regulations or policies will not be promulgated in the future that would have the effect of further restricting the remittance of CNY into or out of the PRC. We cannot assure you, in light of the restrictions in place, or any amendment thereof, that the PRC Subsidiaries will be able to fund their future activities which are conducted in foreign currencies, including the payment of dividends.
Furthermore, under PRC laws, dividends may be paid only out of distributable profits. Distributable profits are the net profit as determined under PRC GAAP, less any recovery of accumulated losses and appropriations to statutory and other reserves required to be made. Our PRC Subsidiaries shall appropriate 10% of the net profits as reported in their statutory financial statements (after offsetting any prior year’s losses) to the statutory surplus reserves until the reserves have reached 50% of their registered capital. As a result, our PRC Subsidiaries may not have sufficient, or any, distributable profits to pay dividends to us. See “Risk Factors–Risks Related to FF’s Operations in China–FFIE is a holding company and, in the future, may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by the PRC Subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements that FFIE may have, and the restrictions on PRC Subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other payments to FFIE could restrict FFIE’s ability to satisfy its liquidity requirements and have a material adverse effect on FFIE’s ability to conduct its business” for a more detailed discussion of the relevant risks relating to restrictions on foreign exchange and transfer of cash.
Requirements Under PRC Laws and Regulations
Under current PRC laws and regulations, each of our PRC Subsidiaries is required to obtain a business license to operate in the PRC. Our PRC Subsidiaries have all received the requisite business license to operate, and no application for business license had been denied.
As our operations in the PRC expand, our PRC Subsidiaries will be required to obtain approvals, licenses, permits and registrations from PRC regulatory authorities, such as the State Administration for Market Regulation, the National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”), and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”), which oversee different aspects of the electric vehicle business. As of February 27, 2023, no application by our PRC Subsidiaries for any such approvals, licenses, permits and registrations that are currently applicable to them had been denied, but there can be no assurance that the PRC Subsidiaries will be able to maintain their existing licenses or obtain new ones. See “Risk Factors–Risks Related to FF’s Operations in China–FF may be adversely affected by the complexity, uncertainties and changes in PRC regulations on internet-related business, automotive businesses and other business carried out by FF’s PRC Subsidiaries.” for a more detailed discussion of the risks relevant to the regulations relating to the operations of the PRC Subsidiaries.
We do not believe any permission is required from any Chinese authorities (including the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) and the Cyberspace Administration of China (the “CAC”)) in connection with our previous offerings or listing. We do not and immediately prior to the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, will not possess over one million of PRC-based individual’s personal information. After consulting our PRC counsel, Fangda Partners, we believe we are currently not subject to the requirement under the Cybersecurity Review Measures that a network platform operator which possesses more than one million users’ personal information must apply for a cybersecurity review with CAC before listing abroad. In addition, as of February 27, 2023, after consulting our PRC counsel, we are not aware of any other laws or regulations currently effective in the PRC which explicitly require us to obtain any permission from the CSRC or other Chinese authorities for our previous offering or listing, nor had we received any inquiry, notice, or warning from the CSRC or any other Chinese authorities in such respects. The PRC authorities have promulgated new or proposed laws and regulations recently to further regulate securities offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers. According to these new laws and regulations and the draft laws and regulations if enacted in their current forms, in connection with our future securities offering activities, we may be required to fulfill filing, reporting procedures with the CSRC, and may be required to go through cybersecurity review by the PRC authorities. However, there are uncertainties with respect to whether we will be able to fully comply with requirements to obtain such permissions and approvals from, or complete such reporting or filing procedures with PRC authorities. For more detailed information, see “Risk Factors–Risks Related to FF’s Operations in China–The approval of, or filing or other administrative procedures with, the CSRC or other PRC governmental authorities may be required in connection with certain of our financing activities, and, if required, we cannot predict if we will be able to obtain such approval or complete such filing or other administrative procedures” and “Risk Factors–Risks Related to FF’s Operations in China–We face challenges from the evolving regulatory environment regarding cybersecurity, information security, privacy and data protection. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and any actual or alleged failure to comply with related laws and regulations regarding cybersecurity, information security, data privacy and protection could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations” for a more detailed discussion of the relevant risks relating to the applicable of PRC laws and Regulations.
Risks Related to FF’s Operations in China
FF operates in China, and plans to have significant operations in the future in China (including Hong Kong) through its PRC Subsidiaries, and faces various legal and operational risks associated with doing business in China, which could result in a material change in the operations of our PRC Subsidiaries, cause the value of FFIE’s securities to significantly decline or become worthless, and significantly limit or completely hinder FF’s ability to accept foreign investments, and FFIE’s and our investors’ ability to offer or continue to offer our shares of Class A Common Stock to investors. FF also faces similar risks related to its expansion plans in Hong Kong, which is subject to political and economic influence from China. These risks, each discussed in detail in the section “Risk Factors–Risks Related to FF’s Operations in China” include:
•Changes in the political and economic policies of the PRC government may materially and adversely affect FF. 
•Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system, regulations and enforcement policies could have a material adverse effect on FF.
•Foreign currency fluctuations could reduce the value of our Common Stock and dividends paid on our Common Stock.
•Changes in the laws and regulations of China or noncompliance with them could adversely affect FF.
•Restrictions on PRC Subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other payments to FFIE in the future could restrict FFIE’s ability to satisfy its liquidity requirements and have a material adverse effect on FFIE’s business.
•FFIE may be classified as a PRC “resident enterprise,” which would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to FFIE and its non-PRC enterprise stockholders.
•FFIE and its stockholders face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in China resident enterprises through transfer of non-Chinese-holding companies.
•PRC regulation of loans to and direct investments in PRC entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC Subsidiaries.
•The PRC government can take regulatory actions and make statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, so our assertions and beliefs of the risks imposed by the Chinese legal and regulatory system cannot be certain, and actions related to oversight and control over offerings that are conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in issuers with substantial operations in China could significantly limit or completely hinder our and our investors’ ability to offer or continue to offer shares of Class A Common Stock $0.0001 par value, and warrants to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless.
•The approval of, or filing or other administrative procedures with, the CSRC or other PRC governmental authorities may be required in connection with certain of our financing activities, and, if required, we cannot predict if we will be able to obtain such approval or complete such filing or other administrative procedures.
•Certain PRC rules and regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to grow in China.
•FF may be adversely affected by the complexity, uncertainties and changes in PRC regulations on internet-related business, automotive businesses and other business carried out by FF’s PRC Subsidiaries.
•We face challenges from the evolving regulatory environment regarding cybersecurity, information security, privacy and data protection.
•In the event that the independent auditor operating in China that FF engages for its operations in China is not permitted to be subject to inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), then investors may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection.
•U.S. regulatory bodies may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.
•There may be difficulties in effecting service of legal process, conducting investigations, collecting evidence, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in China against us and our management.

Partnership Program 

Acting through FF Global Partners LLC (“FF Global”), a major shareholder of the Company, in July 2019 certain current and former executives of the Company established an arrangement which they refer to as the “Partnership Program.” FF Global beneficially owns approximately 15.4% of the voting power of the Company’s fully diluted Common Stock. As described below, the Partnership Program provides financial benefits to certain Company directors, management and employees, which they are required to report to the Company pursuant to the Company’s Investment Reporting Policy. The Partnership Program is administered by FF Global and is not under the Company’s supervision.
Purpose of Partnership Program

The purpose of the Partnership Program is to help the Company and FF Global succeed, including by helping key Company employees remain aligned with the Company’s mission, interests and economic success, by awarding units representing membership interests in FF Global to such individuals. We have been advised by FF Global that the secretary of FF Global provides recommendations to the FF Global Board of Managers regarding proposed awards based on, among other things:

● | the individual’s position in the Company and/or FF Global,


● | the importance of the individual’s role in the Company and/or FF Global,


● | the individual’s historical contributions to the Company and/or FF Global,


● | the importance of the individual to the achievement of the Company’s and FF Global’s strategic objectives,


● | the individual’s awards under the Company’s employee stock option plan, and


● | the individual’s existing holdings of FF Global units.

 The awards under the Partnership Program have in the past been granted exclusively to current or former employees of the Company or its affiliates, FF Global may in the future determine to grant awards to individuals who are not affiliated with the Company. 

Pursuant to our Investment Reporting Policy, members of our management and other employees are required to report information relating to their investments, including their interests in FF Global. However, since the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”) does not have oversight over the Partnership Program, the Company is not able to assess whether awards made by FF Global under the Partnership Program incentivize management and employee behavior and activities that the Company intends to incentivize, or indeed, whether the Partnership Program effectively works against efforts by the Company to manage its workforce. For example, as part of the special committee of independent directors established by the Board to investigate allegations of inaccurate Company disclosures (“Special Committee”), as further discussed below, it was determined that a Company employee who is also a beneficiary under the Partnership Program deliberately interfered with the Special Committee’s investigation. Although the Company disciplined this employee, the effectiveness of the Company’s disciplinary efforts may have been counteracted by awards this employee has received or expects to receive under the Partnership Program. 

Terms of Awards

FF Global units awarded under the Partnership Program are purchased by the recipient from FF Global. The recipient pays the purchase price for their common units in 10 annual installments. The units entitle the recipient to receive distributions from FF Global when and if declared by the FF Global Board of Managers on a pro rata basis based on their paid-in capital (after their contributions are all returned). FF Global units are subject to redemption in certain cases, including upon termination of employment with FF Global or the Company or any of their affiliates, at a redemption price that generally is no lower than the unreturned capital contributions.
Scope of Partnership Program

FF Global has informed us that to date a total of 34 individuals have received awards under the Partnership Program, that 19 individuals continue to hold such awards, and that all recipients of such awards are current or former directors or employees of the Company or its affiliates. Some of these individuals are or were members of the FF Global Board of Managers. In particular, we understand that (amounts below in single dollars):

FF Technology

Variable Platform Architecture 

FF believes one of its core technology competencies is its proprietary Variable Platform Architecture (“VPA”). FF’s VPA is a flexible and adaptable skateboard-like platform featuring a monocoque vehicle structure with integrated chassis and body. The platform directly houses the critical components of an electric vehicle, including all-wheel steering, suspension system, brakes, wheels, electric propulsion system, electronic control units and high voltage battery, among others. Each of these component systems has been engineered in-house or in collaboration with suppliers and has been integrated into the FF vehicle design with a view to strive for optimizing performance, efficient packaging, and functional integration.

As an integrated structure, the skateboard-like platform can be shortened or lengthened to allow various wheelbases and battery pack sizes along with other options to fit into the platform. It is designed to accommodate up to three motors and support single or dual rear motors and a single front motor. The VPA can be configured in front-wheel-drive (“FWD”), rear-wheel-drive (“RWD”) or all-wheel-drive (“AWD”) configurations. The platform enables scalable vehicle design and improves manufacturing flexibility as well as capital efficiency and allows continuous improvement across product generations. It is also designed to reduce development time for future models leveraging the platform, as most of research and development and a significant portion of the crash structure is integrated into the platform and enables five star and equivalent safety performance. The modular design of the VPA is adaptable to support a wide range of FF vehicles for both consumer and commercial vehicle markets.

Propulsion Technology

FF has designed an integrated set of powertrain systems ideally suited for FF’s modular VPA, which has been recently upgraded to PT Gen 2.0 to further enhance performance. FF believes its proprietary and patented designed electric powertrain provides a competitive edge in horsepower, efficiency, and acceleration performance.
FF Echelon Inverter 

The inverter in FF’s electric vehicle powertrain governs the flow of high-voltage electrical current throughout the vehicle and serves to power the electric motor, generating torque while driving and delivering energy into the battery pack while braking. The inverter converts direct current from the battery pack into alternating current to drive the permanent magnet motors and provides “regenerative braking” functionality, which captures energy from braking to charge the battery pack. The primary technological advantages of FF’s designs include the ability to drive large amounts of current in a small, physical package with high efficiency and low cost (low inverter losses to provide 98% of inverter efficiency) utilizing patented parallel IGBT technology and can achieve high torque accuracy with fast transient response. The inverter can achieve high reliability due to tab bonds in the high current path. The monitoring system is integrated into the inverter to provide enhanced safety. The patented FF Echelon Inverter is designed to have high power in a compact light weight package with high reliability and durability and can support multiple motor configurations.
Integrated Electric Motor Drive Units 

FF designed its electric motor drive units (including gearbox). The electric drive units are fully integrated with the inverter, transmission, and control unit to create a compact and efficient design. The FF designed drive units have low noise and vibration that can greatly improve driving experience. Depending on the power requirements of each model, the motors can be utilized individually or in two or three motor configurations. The FF 91 Futurist, equipped with three integrated electric drive units (each is designed to deliver up to 350 horsepower), is expected to deliver 1,050 horsepower and 12,510 Newton meters (“Nm”) of torque. FF believes its electric drive unit design is ahead of many of its competitors in terms of performance because of its proprietary, advanced packaging, stator-rotor design, and unique inverter layout.
Internet, Autonomous Driving, and Intelligence (“I.A.I.”)

FF utilizes an industry-leading automotive grade dual-chip computing system running the Android Automotive operating system. FF’s I.A.I system is built on an enhanced Android Automotive code base and is upgraded with each release of Google’s platform. FF’s vehicles are designed with software OTA capabilities, which allow software and applications in the vehicle to be updated and upgraded wirelessly to deliver continuous enhancements. The vehicle is designed to be connected to FF’s information cloud at all times. When there is a firmware or software update available, FF’s cloud will push an update message to the vehicle to notify the driver to schedule an update. Upgrades will be wirelessly downloaded to the vehicle, installed, and 
enabled, including updates for firmware, operating systems, middleware, and applications. FF’s patented Future OS operating system allows multiple users to login through FF 91, preparing user’s preferences per their cloud based FFID profiles.

For autonomous driving, FF’s Level 3 autonomous driving-ready system (“ADAS”) will deliver multiple ADAS features through a combination of FF’s own as well as industry partners’ applications. FF plans to devote resources to autonomous driving research and development and plans to work with partners to deliver full autonomous-driving capabilities in highway and urban driving, as well as parking, across its vehicle lines in the future.

FF’s Artificial Intelligence system can actively learn preferences, habits, entertainment, and navigation routines of a user, and associates them with the user’s unique FFID (FF proprietary user ID). FFID provides a unique FF user profile that ensures a consistent experience across the FF Ecosystem, as the user goes from one seat to another or even from one vehicle to another. The seamless design and interface of the in-vehicle infotainment system planned in FF vehicles will offer multiple human-machine interface (“HMI”) options and facilitate a personalized user experience for each seat in the vehicle. The enhanced user experience platform powered by Android enables seamless access to third party applications. FF’s patented Intelligent Aggregation Engine can pull content from multiple video applications and displays content in a single area, removing the need to access multiple applications. The Intelligent Recommendation Engine that may be integrated in certain FF series learns each passenger or driver’s digital media preferences across multiple video applications and provide personalized recommendations. The User Recognition function is embedded in each seat through facial or voice recognition, to deliver a suite of personalized content and preferences.





Electrical/ Electronic (“E/E”) Architecture 

FF has designed the first generation of FF vehicle series (FF 91) with a domain-centralized E/E architecture, which enables architecture flexibility and maximizes performance efficiency while meaningfully reducing the overall system complexity and weight. The domain-centralized E/E architecture will consolidate the domain functions across five core high-performance domain control units (“DCU”) that manage, compute, and process controls for propulsion, chassis, self-driving, body, and IoV (Internet of Vehicle-connected infotainment system). The E/E architecture of FF’s variable platform architecture is designed with the capacity to support the power and communication requirements necessary for seamless integration with advanced autonomous systems as they evolve. All of FF’s DCUs will support OTA updates and data collection.

FF Products

FF has developed an extensive portfolio of proprietary technologies that will be embedded and integrated in FF vehicles. FF’s B2C passenger vehicle pipeline over the next five years includes FF 91 series, FF 81 series and FF 71 series. In addition to 
passenger vehicles, leveraging its VPA, FF plans to produce a Smart Last Mile Delivery (“SLMD”) vehicle to address the high growth last mile delivery opportunity.

Passenger Vehicles

Each of the three passenger vehicle series is planned in two different configurations. All passenger vehicles will share common brand “DNA” of:


● | Intelligence, Internet and connectivity;
● | modern design: styling; 


● | superior driving experience: leading power, performance, and driving range; and


● | personalized user experience: space, comfort, and internet experience.

The flagship FF 91 series will define the FF brand DNA. This DNA will carry over to FF 81 and FF 71 series. At the top end, the Futurist configurations of each of these series will be designed to push the core brand values to the maximum. With this brand DNA, FF believes its products will be ahead of competition in their respective segments in terms of design, driving experience, interior comfort, connectivity, and user experience.

FF 91 

With a wheelbase of 3,200 mm (126 inches), FF 91, FF’s flagship vehicle, is designed to be a high-performance luxury electric vehicle in the E-segment/Executive/Full-Size or F-segment/Full-size luxury vehicle segment. Based on certain management assumptions, including the timely receipt of $38.4 million to $58.4 million of additional funding, which commitments have been secured on February 3, 2023, where the Company entered into an Amendment No. 6 to Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Sixth Amendment”) with FF Simplicity as administrative and collateral agent and Senyun, FF Top, FF Simplicity, FF Prosperity, Acuitas and other purchasers, and approval by stockholders of the proposal to increase FFIE’s authorized shares of Class A Common Stock from 815,000,000 to 1,690,000,000, increasing the total authorized shares from 900,000,000 to 1,775,000,000, which approval was obtained during the special meeting of stockholders held on February 28, 2023, timely completion of key equipment installation and commissioning work at the ieFactory California in Hanford, California, suppliers meeting their commitments on program deliverables including parts, the implementation and effectiveness of certain expense reduction and payment delay measures, and timely and successful testing and certification, FF expects start of production of the FF 91 Futurist at the end of March 2023, coming off the line in early April, and deliveries to users anticipated to begin before the end of April 2023. Please refer to “Risk Factors – Risks Related to FF’s Business and Industry – FF’s vehicles are in development and the delivery of FF’s first vehicle has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant delays” for a discussion on risks and uncertainties related to the expected production and delivery.

FF believes that FF 91 represents a “new species” of electric mobility that combines high performance, precise handling, the comfort of a luxury passenger vehicle, and an intelligent, connected user interface which provides a unique mobility experience to both driver and passenger. It leverages FF’s proprietary VPA, which is a skateboard-like platform structure designed and engineered in-house. This integrated platform provides measurable improvements in overall vehicle structural performance, safety, and handling. FF 91 features a multi-motor configuration and an all-wheel drive system. With three electric motors (one in the front and two in the rear), the top configuration (the FF 91 Futurist) is designed to produce 1,050 horsepower and 12,510 Nm of torque to all four wheels. This enables the FF 91 Futurist to have torque vectoring in the rear for enhanced vehicle dynamics and stability. Its all-wheel drive system offers greater traction control as well as precise power distribution. This technology is designed to deliver superior acceleration of 2.27 seconds from 0 to 60 mph and safety.

The variable platform architecture for FF 91 series houses floor-mounted batteries, as well as FF’s proprietary inverter, the FF Echelon Inverter, and integrated electric motor drive units. All three elements, battery, inverter and drive units, support an achieved 381 miles EPA range. FF 91 is expected to charge at up to a 200kW rate. FF plans to provide charging solutions available through FF’s self-owned stores and FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms.

The FF 91 aims to deliver a top-quality experience that emphasizes personalization and comfort for all users of the vehicle, including both driver and passengers. In terms of driver comfort, there are six driver-specific screens including an ultra-large heads-up display and slim instrument cluster. The center information display supports on-screen gesturing with the 
swipe of a user’s fingers. The reconfigurable 3D touch steering wheel can allow further user configurability. The FF 91 is a connected device that has a voice-first user interface as well as an open ecosystem for third-party applications and offers an immersive audio, video, and media experience. There are over 100 inches of high-resolution viewing area across 11 displays embedded in the vehicle. These include industry’s first 17-inch front passenger screen and a large 27-inch rear passenger display, allowing passengers to stream their favorite movies, TV shows and live sports while the FF 91 is in motion without driver distraction. The voice-first foundation enables multiple natural commands at once, facilitating the areas of comfort (including air conditioning, seat positions, and doors), productivity (including text, email, and phone calls), entertainment (including media playlists and content search) and destination reaching (including refined search and navigation). The connectivity is powered by “Super Mobile AP”, which consists of up to three 5G modems to realize aggregated high internet speed and great coverage by multiple carriers for high-throughput and continuous coverage. The Artificial Intelligence system and use of FFID (automatically loaded through facial recognition in each seat) carry the personalized user experience from seat-to-seat and vehicle-to-vehicle. The front and rear passengers will have (post production and delivery) individual sound zones, which allow passengers in the front and passengers in the rear to listen to their separate audio content with minimal sound interference. The luxury interior design of the FF 91 Futurist also features “zero gravity” seats in the rear row (with industry leading 48.9 inches rear leg room and 60-degree recline). The vehicle will also offer a spa mode with personalized seat position, ventilation, massage settings, light animations, and ambient sound.

For autonomous driving, FF 91 is expected to have an array of cameras, sensors and LIDARs. Once an autonomous driving software solution is validated and released, FF anticipates that its autonomous driving system will deliver several highway autonomy and parking features, and through continuous learning over time, will enable Autonomous Valet Parking (“AVP”) - where the vehicle can autonomously navigate a parking lot, find a parking space and park itself. Eventually, the adaptive learning could allow the driver to use an application to park and summon the vehicle after the driver has exited the vehicle.

FF 91 will feature an SAE Level 3 capable autonomous driving system that will deliver multiple ADAS features through a combination of FF’s own as well as partners’ applications. FF plans to devote resources to autonomous driving research and development and plans to work with partners to deliver full autonomous-driving capabilities in highway and urban driving, as well as parking, across its vehicle lines in the future.

FF 91 Futurist currently has an estimated starting price of $180,000 (specific pricing to be refined and finalized closer to time of delivery of each vehicle).








FF 81

The FF 81 series is FF’s planned second vehicle model and is aimed at the premium mass market in the D-segment or E-segment. The FF 81 will be designed and built on FF’s proprietary VPA enabling more than 60% carry-over of common parts from the FF 91. In addition, parts developed for the FF 81 can be carried back to FF 91 series. The large number of common parts shared across vehicle models creates economics of scale and reduces costs.

The FF 81 aims to deliver a premium user experience that emphasizes personalization. The FF 81 is planned with high-performance computing and next generation connectivity with a voice-first user interface and open ecosystem for third-party 
applications. It also has integrated, autonomous driving features and the pertinent hardware capability, including cameras, radars, ultrasound sensors, and optional LIDAR(s).

FF 81 Futurist is expected to compete with vehicles such as the Tesla Models S/X, BMW X5 and Range Rover Sport and the like.

FF 71

FF’s third planned passenger vehicle, the FF 71 series, is expected to be a connected electric vehicle with a more compact size aiming at the mass market in the C-segment or D-segment. The FF 71 will be designed to integrate full connectivity and advanced technology into a smaller vehicle size. FF will start design and development of the FF 71 series after sufficient funding is secured in a timely manner.

FF 71 Futurist is expected to compete with vehicles such as the Porsche Macan, BMW X3, and Jaguar I-Pace.
Commercial Vehicles 

Smart Last Mile Delivery (“SLMD”)

FF plans to provide purpose-built Smart Last Mile Delivery vehicles by leveraging its proprietary technologies developed for FF’s passenger vehicles, to build tailored SLMD configurations to meet the exact customer needs, whether for fleet provider or last mile delivery divisions, while reducing development time and costs.



FF’s technical solutions for advanced connectivity and user experience are well-suited to the SLMD market, where rapid growth is fueling demand for increasingly sophisticated solutions and features. Such features may include:


● | Advanced connectivity and telematics for next-gen fleet management;


● | OTA upgrade capability;


● | Third party application integration on touch screen display;


● | Surround view cameras for improved visibility; and


● | Equipped with Level 3 ready autonomy and ready-for-future capabilities.

SLMD’s adaptive modular design enables additional use cases (utilities, tradesmen, and others) with minimal additional time or investment.

Manufacturing Strategy

FF plans to build FF 91 series vehicles in its manufacturing facility in Hanford, California with a projected annual capacity of 10,000 vehicles. FF will conduct operations similar to traditional vehicle manufacturing facilities such as body assembly, paint operations, final vehicle assembly, and end-of-line testing for FF 91 in the Hanford manufacturing facility. FF intends for its vehicle engineering and manufacturing teams to work alongside one another to streamline the feedback loop for rapid product enhancements and quality improvement and will extensively utilize virtual manufacturing simulation methods to validate operations and improve the manufacturing processes.

For additional capacity for production of the FF 91 (i.e., exceeding 10,000 vehicles annually), FF can expand production operations in Hanford or seek capacity expansion elsewhere. For the FF 81, FF plans to outsource direct vehicle production to its contract manufacturing partner in South Korea, as FF believes outsourcing will reduce capital investment and accelerate its go-to-market strategy for producing and delivering the FF 81, while providing the benefit of flexibility to scale volume to match demand level. FF may outsource the production of the FF 71 to its contract manufacturing partner in South Korea or a manufacturing partner in China or elsewhere. These plans align with FF’s hybrid, flexible manufacturing strategy. For more information about FF’s manufacturing facility, see the discussion below under the heading “– Facilities.” For more information about FF’s contract manufacturing and supply agreement with Myoung Shin in South Korea, see the discussion below under the heading “– Key Agreements and Partnerships.”

Sales, Delivery, and Servicing of Vehicle 

As of the date hereof, FF has not yet sold any electric vehicles. FF plans to adopt a direct sales model that utilizes a mix of online and offline presence to drive sales. FF’s offline sales network will consist of FF experience centers and FF Partner-owned experience centers. The self-operated experience centers are expected to establish FF brand awareness, while the FF Partner-owned experience centers are expected to expand the sales and distribution network without substantial capital investment by FF.

FF recently announced that its first flagship experience center will be located in Beverly Hills, California, and that the Company is currently looking for a second U.S. location. FF expects to open other Company-operated experience centers in the U.S. and China. These locations will operate as experiential showrooms for FF’s electric vehicle models and will provide sales, aftersales, and charging services. The FF Partner-owned stores and showrooms will support FF’s online-to-offline sales model, vehicle delivery, charging service and other user operations.

All purchase transactions will be processed online through FF’s website or mobile apps, while FF Partners will support the process (including demonstration drives and providing vehicle information) and receive compensation based on a revenue sharing model and territory and/or services performed. Users accessing FF.com can directly purchase the vehicle online and can choose their closest FF experience centers or FF Partner-operated experience centers and showroom for support. Customers going to an FF Partner-operated experience centers will be supported by staff and directed to FF.com for purchasing. FF believes that once the reputation of FF’s vehicles has been established and users are familiar with FF vehicles, an increasing share of the vehicle sales process is likely to be completed fully online. This will further free up offline capacity and potentially 
increase productivity for FF’s Partner-operated experience centers. As FF will oversee delivery of the vehicles, both FF stores and FF Partner-operated experience centers and showrooms will be able to run their operations in an asset-light fashion.

The FF Partner-owned experience centers and showrooms will be the prioritized network for servicing FF’s vehicles, which may include repair, maintenance, and bodywork services. FF will also contract with select third-party service centers to ensure coverage and will deploy mobile service vans based on user demand. To ramp up its service capabilities, FF Eco Sales Company, LLC, FF’s sales subsidiary, has engaged Somit Solutions and plans to engage Cox Automotive to support the FF After-sales Systems and Operations. Somit Solutions will develop the underlying systems required to support all after-sales elements, such as warranty, parts catalog, repair manual systems. Cox Automotive is expected to support FF after-sales operations, such as shipping logistics, as well as leveraging Cox’s extensive service center network. Additionally, FF users will benefit from FF’s connected remote service platform that can address a majority of service issues, perform remote diagnosis and OTA updates, perform artificial intelligence and predictive maintenance, and will be able to offer real-time service and repair status update to vehicle users.

FF Suppliers

FF has partnered with reputable suppliers in North America, Europe, and Asia. FF has selected and on-boarded suppliers for all critical parts for the FF 91. FF aims to obtain systems, components, raw materials, parts, manufacturing equipment, and other supplies and services from suppliers which FF believes to be reputable and reliable.

On January 17, 2023, FF announced that, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, it had reached a non-binding Cooperation Framework Agreement with the government of the City of Huanggang in Hubei Province, China (“Huanggang”), for promoting FF’s U.S.-China dual-home market strategy. According to the Cooperation Framework Agreement, FF intends to relocate its FF China headquarters to Huanggang, while maintaining its global headquarters in Los Angeles, California. In accordance with the Cooperation Framework Agreement, both parties are expected to contribute their respective advantages in investment, scientific and technological innovation, industrial transformation, location, and policy. Huanggang is expected to actively assist FF by providing assistance with industrial layout and deployment of resources and providing financial and policy support. The FF China headquarters is expected to be jointly funded by the Huanggang Government guide fund, industrial fund, and FF.

Human Capital Management and Resources

As of February 27, 2023, FF had 586 employees globally. A majority of FF’s employees are engaged in research and development and related engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain functions. To preserve its current cash position, FF may implement additional headcount reductions, taking into account FF’s financial condition and market conditions.

In the future, FF may ramp up additional hiring efforts for its targeted vehicle production and delivery. FF’s targeted hires typically have significant experience working for reputable OEMs, software, internet, consumer electronics and artificial intelligence companies, as well as tier-one automotive suppliers and engineering firms. FF has not experienced any work stoppages and considers its relationship with its employees to be good. None of FF’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor union.

The FF team is composed of experienced talent from a variety of industry backgrounds and nationalities with a common goal of creating highly innovative and unique products. FF’s human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating existing and additional employees. FF is committed to the principle of ESG and is committed to building a safer, cleaner world. We have a diverse workforce and are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethics and behavior.

Governmental Regulations, Programs and Incentives 

FF operates in an industry that is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which has become more stringent over time. The laws and regulations to which FF is subject govern, among others, vehicle emissions and the storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the remediation of environmental contamination. Compliance with such laws and regulations at an international, regional, national, provincial and local level is critical to FF’s ability to continue its operations.

Environmental standards applicable to FF are established by the laws and regulations of the countries in which FF operates, standards adopted by regulatory agencies and the permits and licenses issued to FF. Each of these sources is subject to periodic modifications and comprise what FF anticipates will be increasingly stringent requirements. Violations of these laws, regulations or permits and licenses may result in substantial administrative, civil or even criminal fines, penalties and orders to cease any violating operations or to conduct or pay for corrective work. In some instances, violations may also result in the suspension or revocation of permits or licenses.

Vehicle Safety and Testing Regulation

FF vehicles will be subject to, and must comply with, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”). As a manufacturer, FF must self-certify that its vehicles meet all applicable FMVSSs before the vehicles are sold in the U.S. There are many FMVSSs that will apply to FF vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements (e.g., limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention and avoidance of electric shock after certain crash tests). FF’s future vehicles must fully comply with all applicable FMVSSs. Additionally, there are regulatory changes being considered for several FMVSSs, and FF must comply with all such FMVSS regulations.
In addition to FMVSS, FF will also be required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls and owners’ manual requirements. FF must also comply with the Automobile Information and Disclosure Act, which requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. Further, this law allows inclusion of city and highway range ratings, as determined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA.

FF vehicles sold outside of the U.S. will be subject to similar foreign safety, environmental, and other regulations. If those regulations and standards are different from those applicable in the U.S., FF will redesign and/or retest its vehicles. For example, the European Union (“E.U.”) has established new approval and oversight rules requiring that a national authority certify compliance with heightened safety rules, emissions limits and production requirements before vehicles can be sold in each E.U. member state, the initial of which rules were rolled out on September 1, 2020, and there is also regulatory uncertainty regarding how these rules will impact sales in the United Kingdom given its recent withdrawal from the E.U. These changes could impact the rollout of new vehicle features in Europe. FF vehicles sold in China will be subject to compulsory product certification by certification authorities designated by the State Certification and Accreditation Administration Committee. Additionally, for FF vehicles to be approved for manufacture and sale in China, FF vehicles will need to be added to the Announcement of Vehicle Manufacturers and Products issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (“MIIT”) of China, by showing compliance with the relevant safety and technical requirements and other conditions, including among others, the Administrative Rules on the Admission of New Energy Vehicle Manufacturers and Products and the Administrative Rules on the Admission of Passenger Vehicles Manufacturer and Products, and passing the review by the MIIT.

Battery Safety and Testing Regulations

FF’s battery packs must conform to mandatory regulations governing the transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation, which includes lithium-ion batteries, and are subject to regulations issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. (“PHMSA”). These regulations are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of transportation when these items are shipped, such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or air. FF will complete the applicable transportation tests for its battery packs, demonstrating its compliance with applicable regulations. FF uses lithium-ion cells in its high-voltage battery packs. The use, storage and disposal of FF’s battery packs is regulated under federal law. FF will enter into agreements with third-party battery recycling companies to recycle FF’s battery packs.
Environmental Credits

In connection with the production, delivery, and placement into service of FF’s zero-emission vehicles, FF may earn tradable credits under certain governmental programs designed to incentivize such activities. FF may sell FF future credits to automotive companies and other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements. Under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards, FF may generate carbon dioxide emissions credits that can be sold to conventional internal combustion engine vehicle manufacturers. On December 30, 2021, EPA issued new greenhouse gas emissions standards for model years 2023-2026 light duty vehicles that accelerates the annual year-over-year increase in the stringency of the standards from 1.5% to 5-10%. These standards include carbon dioxide emission credit multipliers for the sale of electric vehicles, and EPA predicts that the standards will result in electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles having a market share of approximately 17% by model year 2026. Similarly, on August 25, 2022, the California Air Resources Board approved the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which amends California’s existing Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation to require an increasing number of zero-emission vehicles starting with model year 2026 and growing to a 100% transition of light duty passenger vehicles to electric vehicles by model year 2035. Under both federal and California regulations, FF may earn salable regulatory credits as vehicle manufacturers are 
required to meet annual emissions or zero-emissions vehicle sales requirements or purchase commensurate offset credits. FF may also earn similar fuel economy and clean fuels credits under other regulatory regimes in the U.S. and abroad.

EPA Emissions and Certification

The U.S. Clean Air Act requires that FF obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA or a California Executive Order issued by CARB certifying that FF vehicles comply with all applicable emissions requirements. A Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards. A CARB Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have adopted California’s stricter standards for emissions controls related to new vehicles and engines sold in such states. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the CARB Executive Order for sales of vehicles. In addition to California, there are 17 other states that have either adopted or are in the process of adopting the stricter California standards, including New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, Virginia, and New Mexico. FF recently achieved CARB certification for the FF 91 and achieved an EPA attested range of 381 miles. Starting in model year 2026, FF must also meet California data standardization requirements for zero-emission vehicles, which specifies required vehicle and battery data that must be made available to vehicle owners through a scan tool device.

Regulation––Self Driving 

There are no federal U.S. regulations pertaining to the safety of self-driving vehicles; however, the NHTSA has established recommended guidelines. Certain U.S. states have legal restrictions on self-driving vehicles, and many other states are considering them. This patchwork of licensing requirements increases the legal complexity for FF’s vehicles. In Europe, certain vehicle safety regulations apply to self-driving braking and steering systems, and certain treaties also restrict the legality of certain higher levels of self-driving vehicles. Self-driving laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and foreign countries, and may create restrictions on self-driving features that FF develops.

Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation 

U.S. state laws regulate the manufacture, distribution and sale of automobiles, and generally require motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed in order to sell vehicles directly to consumers in the state. FF will need to secure dealer licenses (or their equivalent) and engage in sales activities for its self-operated experience centers and service centers, while partners in certain states will support by providing services via partner-owned experience centers and showrooms. FF U.S. has received its dealer license from the State of California and is able to sell automobiles across the U.S.

In China, automobile suppliers and dealers are required to receive a business license and file and update the relevant information through the information management system for the national automobile circulation operated by the competent commerce department in China. Additionally, according to the Administrative Measures on Automobile Sales, automobile suppliers and dealers shall sell automobiles, spare parts, and other related products that are in compliance with relevant provisions and standards of the state, and the dealers shall, in an appropriate manner, expressly indicate the prices of automobiles, spare parts, and other related products as well as the rates of charges for various services on their business premises, and shall not sell products at higher prices or charge other fees without express indication.

Competition 

FF has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, intense competition from several companies, particularly as the transportation sector increasingly shifts towards low-emission, zero-emission, or carbon neutral solutions. Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel and electric vehicle market. Many major automobile manufacturers, such as Tesla, Porsche, Mercedes, Rolls Royce and Audi, have electric vehicles available today. Other current and prospective automobile manufacturers are also developing electric vehicles, for example Nio, xPeng, Li Auto, Lucid Motors, Canoo and Fisker, among others. In addition, several manufacturers offer hybrid vehicles, including plug-in versions. FF directly competes with other pure-play electric vehicle companies targeting the high-end segment, while also competing to a lesser extent with new energy vehicles (“NEVs”) and internal combustion engine (“ICE”) vehicles in the mid to high-end segment offered by traditional OEMs. FF believes the primary competitive factors in the electric vehicle market include, but are not limited to:

● | pricing;


● | technological innovation, recently enhanced through PT Gen 2.0;


● | vehicle performance, quality, safety and reliability;


● | space, comfort, and user experience;


● | service and charging options;


● | design, styling, and interior materials; and


● | manufacturing efficiency.

FF believes that it will compete favorably with its competitors on the basis of these factors. However, most of FF’s current and potential competitors have greater financial, technical, supply chain, manufacturing, marketing, and other resources than FF. They may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, supply chain, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing, and support of their electric vehicles. Additionally, FF’s competitors may also have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, lower cost of materials, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships, and other resources than FF does.
