ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Yield10 Bioscience, Inc. ("Yield10" or the "Company") is an agricultural bioscience company focused on the large-scale production of low carbon sustainable products from processing Camelina seed using the oilseed Camelina sativa ("Camelina") as a platform crop. These seed products include:
•Camelina oil for use as a low carbon biofuel feedstock
•Omega-3 oils for nutrition 
•PHA Bioplastics for biodegradable zero waste packaging solutions
The co-product from producing these seed products is Camelina meal which has a protein content of over 40% and is currently approved for use in a range of animal feed rations.
Our commercial plan is based on developing and releasing a series of proprietary elite Camelina seed varieties incorporating genetic traits from our development pipeline which are being designed to offer improved on-farm performance that we anticipate will lead to increased acreage adoption and seed product revenue. Yield10 is headquartered in Woburn, Massachusetts and has a Canadian subsidiary, Yield10 Oilseeds Inc., located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.
Camelina, an annual oilseed plant in the mustard family, was selected as our platform crop based on its unique attributes, including its excellent agronomic traits such as low water and fertilizer input, drought resistance and short life cycle, making it suitable as a rotation crop within the U.S. Northwest and regions of Canada, as well as a relay or cover crop 
with corn and soybean in the U.S. Midwest. We estimate there is the potential for over 30 million acres of Camelina production in North America. Camelina, is in the same plant family as canola and naturally produces a relatively abundant harvest of oil-containing protein-rich seeds. Camelina is highly amenable to advanced genetic engineering and genome-editing technologies.  Over the last twelve years, we have been developing improved Camelina seed varieties through identification and deployment of our gene trait discoveries followed by performance evaluation in field tests. Our new seed product traits include the PHA bioplastic trait developed by us and the omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) oil traits on which we secured exclusive rights to a commercial license option in 2020.
Our capital light business model is based on contracting with growers to produce Camelina grain using our proprietary Camelina seed. Yield10 will have the exclusive right to purchase the harvested grain from these growers for downstream processing to separate and sell the seed products into the different markets. Our commercial launch plan is to leverage the growing global demand for biofuels to decarbonize the transportation sector, and in particular, the renewable diesel ("RD") and sustainable aviation fuel ("SAF") markets. We recognized early on that we could play an important role in the biofuel value chain through the use of our advanced Camelina platform to address a key industry bottleneck; the significant shortfall in the supply of low carbon intensity feedstock oil. The establishment of downstream value chain partnerships represents a critical step towards enabling Yield10 to scale this business. We expect to build the operating foundation of our products business by securing offtake agreements with downstream oilseed processing/biofuel partners. Sources of revenue from our first Camelina seed product will be based on the financial terms negotiated with these biofuel offtake partners. Here our goal is to link the base oil price for other commodity seed oils, such as soybean, and share in the economic value of the lower carbon intensity score of the Camelina oil. Initial revenue growth from this business will scale up based on increasing the number of acres of our Camelina planted during each growing season. Feedback from our grower outreach has identified weed control and soil residues from the herbicides used on prior crop as key limitations to the adoption of existing Camelina varieties. To achieve our revenue targets, improved Camelina varieties with new genetic traits are being accelerated through our development pipeline in order to offer farmers weed control and a seamless integration into their current crop rotations. We expect to be able to substantiate increasing revenue for our growers by introducing proprietary performance traits from the Yield10 pipeline, including higher seed oil content and seed yield traits that can increase the per acre harvest value of the Camelina grain. Improved grower income is expected to lead to increasing numbers of growers under contract, increased acres planted and higher product revenue and income for the Company. 
Advancements in Camelina varieties, seed operations capabilities, grower network and supply chain developed for biofuels and underwritten by biofuel partnerships will position Yield10 for the subsequent launch of its second Camelina seed product omega-3 oils and in the future, PHA bioplastics.
As a first stage in our initial Camelina commercialization, during the third quarter of 2022, we engaged growers in contracts for the production of Camelina grain and Camelina seed having a total acreage of approximately 1,000 acres. These growers are located in the U.S. and Canada with each grower planting between 30 and 160 acres of our WDH2 (winter, cold tolerant) and WDH3 (winter, early maturing) seed varieties, with harvest expected to occur in the summer of 2023. We intend to use the seed harvest for toll crushing and further seed production that will provide us with seed inventory for future grower contracts during 2023 and beyond. Also, during 2022, we contracted with other growers to plant our E3902 (spring, high oil yield), WDH2 (winter, increased cold tolerance) and WDH3 (winter, early flowering) Camelina plant varieties to produce commercial planting seed. This activity is an essential part of our business model to produce commercial seed inventory for future grower contracts. We expect future grower contracts to cover Camelina grain production for large-scale grain processing to supply low-carbon intensity feedstock oil for the biofuel market and high-protein meal for the animal feed market.
We are currently pursuing the development of elite Camelina germplasm exhibiting herbicide tolerance, disease resistance and other traits that we believe in the near future, will form improved elite Camelina varieties for the biofuel market and will later be combined with the new seed product traits in development to expand our markets. We ultimately expect to have three types of elite Camelina seed varieties in contracted production to address our product markets.
We believe the market opportunity for biofuel feedstocks from our elite Camelina varieties, as well as our other proprietary seed products in development, including performance traits for use in other crops, is significant. We are targeting uses for our Camelina seed products in commercial applications such as: low-carbon feedstock oils for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, PHA bioplastics, and omega-3 oils for aquaculture and nutrition. In July 2022, we signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding ("MOU") with Mitsubishi Corporation to evaluate the establishment of a partnership to supply, offtake and market Camelina as a low-carbon feedstock oil for biofuel, and in February 2023, we signed another nonbinding MOU with American Airlines to collaborate in the development of the value chain for Camelina 
as a low-carbon feedstock oil for sustainable aviation fuel. We believe performance traits from our gene discovery and development platform (the "Trait Factory") and value-added product strategy will provide strong differentiation for Yield10's elite Camelina seed varieties, making them preferred by growers to address large product market opportunities as illustrated below. These traits will also be made available to leading seed companies for use in other crops to create licensing revenue.
1.Internal Company estimates of 2030 product revenue potential.
Our Camelina platform and each of our seed product targets are well-aligned with global trends in reducing carbon emissions and improving sustainability, including the need for:
•Producing low-carbon intensity biofuel feedstock oil for renewable diesel and aviation biofuel.
•Increasing the production of cover crops to reduce the climate change impact from agriculture.
•Producing PHA bioplastics to enable single use food service items and packaging with zero waste.
•Increasing global food security by:
◦producing land-based omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) fatty acid oils for use in aquaculture and nutraceuticals;
◦increasing high quality protein production from Camelina seed; and
◦developing performance traits to increase yield and/or seed oil per acre for major food crops.
We have a pipeline of more than 10 novel yield and/or seed oil content performance traits currently in research and development. Today, we also have research agreements in place for a number of our yield trait gene candidates, including agreements with GDM Seeds (“GDM”) and JR Simplot Company (“Simplot”). These companies are currently progressing the development of our traits in soybean and potato. Our plan is to support these licensees as they work to generate proof points using our traits in their crops of interest. We also plan to find partners for our traits in canola, corn and other crops as we generate additional data and new trait leads using our Trait Factory.
We are building an intellectual property portfolio around our crop technologies and traits. As of December 31, 2022, we own or hold exclusive rights to 19 patent families, including 15 issued patents and 41 pending patent applications, related to advanced technologies for increasing crop performance and composition traits in oils and PHA bioplastics, in the United States and throughout the world. As part of our agreement with Rothamsted Research Limited ("Rothamsted"), we have an exclusive option to license two patent families, including six issued patents and four pending applications, including both the original patent filing for the production of EPA, DHA+EPA oil in Camelina and for an improvement patent filed after the agreement was signed. In November 2022, Yield10 and Rothamsted agreed to extend the exclusive option and license agreement until December 31, 2023.
The Unmet Need: Global Food Supply, Reducing Carbon Emissions and Producing Sustainable Products
According to a number of studies, including a report entitled “The Future of Food: Complexities and Compromises,” published December 6, 2020, by Morgan Stanley, the world's agri-food system needs to transform in order to produce 50% more food, eliminate malnutrition and cut 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2050. Agriculture will also need to become a source of low-carbon feedstocks for fuels, chemicals and plastics. This will result in a significant increase 
in demand for feed grains, seed oils, protein, and farmed seafood with an increasing emphasis on sustainable growth metrics and climate change, as highlighted in the Morgan Stanley report.
Regulatory Incentives to Reduce Carbon Emissions: Converting biomass feedstocks to biofuels is an environmentally friendly process. When renewable biodiesel is used instead of traditional petroleum diesel, it helps reduce carbon emissions. Camelina oil has a particular advantage because of its low carbon footprint. The regulatory environment for carbon emissions is rapidly changing. Currently, there are existing regulatory incentives from regional greenhouse gas reduction mandates established for fuel producers. This includes California's Low Carbon Fuel Standards market, which measures the specific carbon index, or CI, of every type of fuel, assigns a credit/deficit for every gallon of fuel produced based on its CI, and requires all fuel producers selling into California to purchase enough credits to keep their portfolio CI score below an established baseline. Biofuel manufacturers are highly motivated to utilize compatible feedstocks with a low-carbon footprint in order to meet the regulatory standards to lower carbon emissions. As a benchmark, petroleum diesel has a reported CI of 100, soybean oil has a CI of 56, and in the case of Camelina oil, Sustainable Oils, a subsidiary of Global Clean Energy Holdings, Inc., recently reported a CI of 23.
Renewable Diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel: As part of the energy transition, a substantial increase in renewable diesel capacity in the United States and Canada is currently underway, with proposed and funded renewable diesel facilities having a total capacity of over 6 billion gallons of biofuels per year. Renewable diesel expansion has surged due to its low carbon footprint, federal and local subsidies, and its ability to be used as a drop-in replacement for petroleum diesel. Renewable diesel feedstock is supplied primarily from used cooking oil, animal fats (e.g., tallow), and vegetable oil, with the former two feedstock sources in short supply due to limited production capacity. Yield10 therefore expects the increase in demand for renewable diesel feedstock over the next few years will be filled by vegetable oils, which have a current global production and consumption demand of 50 billion gallons per year. Moreover, a third of vegetable oils produced globally today are palm oils, which do not qualify for many biofuels subsidies because of their high carbon footprint. Numerous studies and regulatory approvals have shown Camelina oil’s usefulness as a low-carbon feedstock oil for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Residual Camelina protein meal remaining after oil extraction using cold crushing has been approved by regulatory authorities for use in animal feed applications in the U.S. and Canada. Camelina’s low-carbon footprint, and ability to be grown as a cover crop on otherwise fallow land, makes it an attractive choice to fill the renewable diesel feedstock supply gap. Based on the assumption of 60-100 gallons of Camelina oil per acre, 1 billion gallons of feedstock oil would require 10 to 15 million acres of Camelina production. When we later launch our elite PHA Camelina product, we estimate Camelina acreage could more than double. For comparison purposes, canola is currently grown on approximately 20 million acres per year in Canada. Although we have described the case for renewable diesel, feedstock demand for biodiesel and renewable aviation biofuel may also increase demand for Camelina oil.
Cover Crops: To meet growing demand for oils and protein, and to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of current farming practices, particularly in the corn belt, the development of cash cover crops or relay crops is another means to increase land productivity and address growing demand. Cover or relay crops are planted between harvest and sowing of major commodities, such as soybean, in effect increasing the number of harvests per growing season. Yield10 believes that Camelina, with its short growing season, has considerable potential to be used as a cover crop to reduce soil erosion, improve soil quality, and control diseases and pests and nutrient run-off from land that is used for row crop production. Camelina can also be used in crop rotation with other crops such as wheat, cereals, corn and soybean. Third party estimates indicate that Camelina has up to 30 million acres of potential as a cover crop in the United States midwest, and we believe that the product value-add from Yield10’s proprietary products will be a key differentiator for farmers making planting decisions. We plan to evaluate the CI of Camelina oil from cover cropping where we anticipate there may be further CI improvements from the positive environmental impact of cover cropping in general, although this remains to be demonstrated.
PHA Bioplastic, Alternatives to Plastic: Global plastic production today is estimated at 380 million tonnes per year. The largest market for this plastic is for packaging materials and food service items, which accounts for nearly half of all plastic waste generated globally, most of which is never recycled or incinerated. As a result, there is growing pressure from consumers, major brand owners and the financial sector to develop alternative materials and alternative end-of life solutions for plastics. This has resulted in additional capital investment to produce compostable materials like polylactic acid ("PLA") and fermentation based PHA bioplastics. PHA bioplastics are natural microbial high molecular weight polymeric storage 
polymers. The value chain from microbial production to plastic product manufacturing, performance in use and end of life based on natural biodegradation has already been validated. PHAs can be recovered from the microbes which produce them, processed into standard plastic pellets and used in existing plastics processing equipment to make a range of food service items and packaging product forms. The commercialization of PHAs based on fermentation technologies continues to receive considerable investment, even though this approach has very high capital investment and operating costs that will limit supply and market penetration. We believe that in longer term, the direct production of PHA bioplastics in Camelina seed would represent a disruptive manufacturing technology for PHA bioplastics due to its significantly lower production costs and very large-scale potential. This opportunity could provide significant additional economic returns for farmers and would justify large acreage adoption of elite PHA Camelina as a cover crop and would support broad adoption of PHA Camelina materials for large markets including water treatment and sustainable biodegradable plastics replacement applications.
PHA Bioplastic, Water Treatment: In water treatment, the PHA biomaterial acts as a growth substrate and energy source for the denitrifying of bacteria, which convert nitrate, a primary cause of water pollution and algal growth, to nitrogen gas, which returns to the air. This application is technically straight-forward, requiring only the production and shipment of PHA biomaterials in pellet form. The model for this business is to supply the continuous replenishment of the PHA pellets. We believe that this application is less demanding on the purity and quality of the PHA produced and represents a favorable technical path to initial commercialization for PHA Camelina. This application may also serve as a market for PHA produced in the future for bioplastic applications, which do not meet the product specifications or ultimately as a way to generate value by “upcycling” post-consumer PHA bioplastic. Yield10 is in the early stages of developing the business model for this opportunity.
Omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) Oils: The aquaculture sector will play a major role in meeting the growing global demand for fish, an important high value protein source in human diets. Sustainable land-based sources of key feed ingredients will need to be developed and adopted to support this demand. This includes high value specialty ingredients, including in particular new sources of omega-3 oils to replace oil from stagnating supplies of ocean-harvested fish used in feed production. Fish oil supplied from ocean-harvested fish is particularly important for farmed salmon. The Atlantic salmon aquaculture sector is expected to grow at 4% CAGR through 2026, reaching an annual harvest of over 3 million tonnes. The growth of the salmon farming sector along with additional demand from new nutraceutical markets for direct human consumption are expected to exceed the world's sustainable supply. In 2021, 4.7 million metric tonnes of fish feed was used globally for salmon aquafarming. Although it can vary by geographic location, during 1990 fish oil represented 24% of the contents making up fish feed. This equates to 2,487 million pounds of oil (fish and other sources of omega-3 rich oil) consumed annually in salmon feed production. Some industry experts predict the demand for omega-3 will increase by more than 7% per year over the next 5 years. The demand from salmon farming alone is expected to grow by approximately 4% per year going forward, according to the 2022 Salmon Farming Industry Handbook. Fish oil is also the key raw material source for producing purified omega-3 fatty acids for the growing use of these omega-3 acids in the nutrition, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets.
High Protein Meal: There is a growing global demand for additional protein sources for animal feed and food applications. Camelina seed can be processed using existing oilseed processing facilities to extract the oil, and the residual meal that remains is a high-quality protein. On a dry basis, the meal contains approximately 30-35% protein with a good amino acid profile for animal feed applications. Camelina meal has been approved for use in some animal feed applications, and we expect that with additional accelerated breeding using genome editing, the meal quality can be further enhanced to further improve its feed value and expand this application.
Trait Development and Licensing: Using our GRAIN system, we have identified and are evaluating novel yield trait genes to improve the field performance of Camelina that will be used in our products business. These traits will be made available to leading seed companies for use in other crops to create licensing revenue.
Business Strategy
In defining our business strategy, it is important to understand that Yield10 is not a seed company in the traditional sense of developing new seed varieties solely for sale to growers. Our goals are to 1) commercialize a series of seed products 
based on developing proprietary varieties of Camelina seed for contract production, the output of which will enable the supply chain for our seed products, and 2) license our yield and seed oil content gene traits to major seed companies for other crops including corn, soybean and canola. Although our Camelina products will address key sustainability drivers, we believe they should reward farmers and increase profitability across the value chain. We also believe that any sustainability benefits will provide a marketing advantage for our future customers along with a potential upside from any available government credits. We also plan to continue to seek non-dilutive financing opportunities from government grants and funded partnerships. Although our Trait Factory may enable multiple commercial opportunities going forward, we will maintain our capital efficient approach, focusing internal resources on developing elite varieties of Camelina germplasm for biofuel feedstock, omega-3 oils and PHA bioplastics. Although we have relied primarily on Rothamsted to continue to develop and improve the omega-3 oil trait for Camelina, during 2023 we expect to become more directly involved in establishing the path to commercialization. Given our focus on establishing and growing our Camelina seed products business, we plan to rely on granting research licenses to interested seed companies for the development of our traits in the major food crops. Using this approach, we are developing the following three potential revenue streams:
•Camelina grain production to be sold into the biofuel oil markets; including the low carbon renewable diesel feedstock and the sustainable aviation fuel markets; 
•Omega-3 Camelina grain production for high EPA omega-3 oil for nutrition and pharmaceutical markets; and
•R&D revenue from government grants and/or partners.
Target Crop: The Oilseed Camelina
Camelina was grown extensively in Europe, Russia and Central Asia since medieval times for oil and protein but was replaced by cultivation of rapeseed during the 1940s.  Camelina has the potential to replicate the development of modern canola from rapeseed on an accelerated timeline based on modern biotechnologies, both components of our Trait Factory. Starting in the 1960s, the breeding of canola from rapeseed to the first generation was not completed until 1982, and was based on improving the oil for human consumption (low euricic acid in oil) and improving the protein meal (low glucosinolates) for use in animal feed. This was followed by incorporating herbicide tolerance and hybrid technologies in the 1990s. Today, canola is grown on 20 million acres in Canada and is estimated to generate around $25 billion for the Canadian economy, according to the Canola Council of Canada.
Camelina has not been subject to intensive plant breeding efforts or crop production improvements, so the full potential of this crop has not yet been achieved. Initial interest in using Camelina oil in biofuels resulted in additional investment in the development of the crop in North America. This work demonstrated that Camelina has several beneficial attributes; it is amenable to production practices used for canola, grows on marginal lands, has enhanced drought and cold tolerance, demonstrates early maturation and requires fewer inputs than other oilseed crops. Camelina is also naturally resistant to diseases that impact canola and its fast growing cycle makes this crop suitable for spring and winter planting in the Northwest U.S. and into Canada as an alternative rotation crop where the relatively overall short growing season would make double cropping very challenging. Further south, the longer overall growing season in the upper mid-west together with Camelina’s short growing season makes it an attractive winter oilseed for relay or cover cropping in corn and soybean rotations. Although the double cropping scenario is where we see the greatest long-term potential for Camelina, our current varieties and capabilities are better positioned for the initial commercial launch geography in the Northwest U.S. and western Canada.
Our vision is to complete development of Camelina lines containing herbicide tolerance ("HT") and downy mildew resistance ("DMR") traits, and to combine these new lines with our proprietary performance traits to increase Camelina seed oil content and yield for the existing oil and protein meal markets. We recognized early on the need to develop Camelina lines optimized for seamless integration into both crop and chemical rotations in our target geographies. For the Northwest U.S. and Canada, the herbicide tolerance traits selected for accelerated development were chosen to address critical farmer issues in our launch geography. The first requirement is for broadleaf and grassy weed control. An ideal herbicide trait package for growers would have the following key elements:
•Control of grassy weeds (GW-HT)
•Control of broadleaf weeds (BW-HT)
•Tolerance to soil residues of Group 2 herbicides of which there are two different types: sulfonylureas (SU-HT) and imidazolonones (IMI-HT) when combined SU/IMI-HT.
Camelina is already naturally tolerant to the grass herbicide Clethodin, so there is no need to develop traits in Camelina to provide tolerance to the chemical.
The BW-HT trait offers farmers an important tool for fighting broadleaf weeds that, if left uncontrolled, can reduce crop yields significantly and increase weed pressure on that land for subsequent crop plantings. Building on encouraging field trial results generated in the spring of 2022, we conducted contra-season field tests of our lead BW-HT trait in Camelina which also demonstrated herbicide tolerance. To speed up development we also selected potential commercial Camelina BW-HT lines displaying strong tolerance to the herbicide with no impact on seed yield for seed scale-up activities to produce seed for larger field tests planned for the spring of 2023. Our goal is to have elite HT Camelina varieties entering commercial production in the next few years followed shortly thereafter by triple stacked commercial BW-HT/SU/IMI-HT Camelina varieties.
 SU-HT and IMI-HT are being developed to enable Camelina to be tolerant to Class 2 herbicides commonly used in that region for certain cereals and other crops. These weed control chemistries persist for longer in the soil which results in plant back restrictions for the next crop in the rotation and in some cases, this can be up to two years. Camelina is very sensitive to these herbicide residues which can prevent seed emergence and severely impair seed yields. Based on discussions with farmers we know the stacked HT/SU/IMI-HT trait package will be an important enabler for large acre adoption in this region. For these reasons we are advancing the development of Camelina lines with stacked HT/SU/IMI-HT traits. These traits and the availability of Clethodin for grassy weed control will provide Yield10 with an ideal herbicide package for the chosen commercial launch region. Greenhouse studies have already identified lead candidate lines with the stacked herbicide requirements and we are in the planning process to enable initial field trials in 2023. 
 Downy mildew is a common name for a widespread plant disease (pathogen) that if left uncontrolled, can generate significant losses in crop yields. In the near-term there are fungicide treatments that can control downy mildew disease. However, this approach adds grower cost so we are also developing genetic solutions using breeding, genetic modification and genome-editing to incorporate DMR traits into the plants. Development of our elite Camelina lines with HT and DMR traits is an important criteria needed for broad-based commercial acceptance of our Camelina plant varieties.
In the longer term, we believe optimizing the production of the PHA bioplastics in Camelina will enable large acreage production, initially in spring varieties, and over time, in winter varieties for use as a cash cover crop. Some estimates from the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") indicate a potential of up to 30 million acres of Camelina in the upper corn belt of the U.S., which would potentially make PHA Camelina the third largest crop in the U.S. Concurrent with this development of PHA Camelina, we plan to develop the high value omega-3 regulated trait based on our November 2020 agreement with Rothamsted. This omega-3 Camelina is at a high technology readiness level, and we are now progressing in early commercialization activities for this program.
To summarize, Camelina is an attractive choice of crop for the following reasons:
•Camelina, as an underdeveloped crop, has high technology upside potential to improve agronomics (including herbicide tolerance), seed yield, and seed value.
•There is a growing demand for crops that diversify the crop landscape, have a lower environmental footprint and have the potential to produce high value secondary products, opening new opportunities for farmers.
•Camelina is readily segregated from the major row crops and readily engineered using genetic engineering tools, making it an ideal platform for producing novel seed products.
•Yield10 has demonstrated that Camelina can be readily engineered to incorporate well-proven herbicide trait technologies with the potential to take advantage of the more favorable regulatory systems in place in the U.S. under the SECURE rule and under development in Canada.
•Camelina has been engineered to produce high levels of omega-3 (EPA and DHA+EPA) fatty acids as a drop-in replacement oil for fish oil in aquafeed markets as well as for use in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications.
•Camelina has potential to become a high value crop with very large non-traditional markets in water treatment and plastics. We first demonstrated proof-of-concept for PHA bioplastics in Camelina in our 2020 field tests, and the result was confirmed in our 2021 and 2022 field tests. This ability to produce PHA in Camelina is providing us with the potential to link a new high value Camelina crop with very large non-traditional markets in water treatment and plastics. Our internal analysis indicates this could drive very large acreage adoption. The higher per acre value enabled by Yield10's agronomic and product traits could make Yield10 the preferred production contractor for growers.
Production of Camelina seed in double cropping situations results in a favorable CI for the oil, making it an attractive feedstock for renewable diesel in geographies such as California where there are low carbon fuel standards in place and the economic value of carbon savings can be substantial. Low-carbon fuel standards are being established in other regions of the U.S., Canada and the E.U., which is increasing demand for renewable diesel feedstocks.
Camelina Seed Products Business 
Our long-term vision is to develop and commercialize three types of elite Camelina varieties (Elite Camelina, Elite PHA Camelina, and Elite Omega-3 Camelina) as large acreage cover crops that will increase farm revenue and support the production of low carbon sustainable seed products with the additional positive environmental impact of reducing nutrient pollution from fertilizer use and increasing soil carbon content. Our plan is to:
•develop proprietary elite Camelina varieties offering superior returns to farmers and increased seed product revenue and margins to Yield10,
•contract production of Camelina grain with farmers for processing into seed products, and
•enter into offtake agreements for the Camelina grain products in each market segment.
To achieve this, Yield10 has been developing proprietary Camelina seed lines which are being progressed to elite Camelina variety status and ultimately to product commercialization. Gene traits currently in our development pipeline fall into three categories:
•input traits including traits for HT and DMR,
•performance traits from our GRAIN platform including traits to increase seed oil content and seed yield, and
•new seed product traits including PHA bioplastics and omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) oil.
We plan to launch the new Camelina varieties incorporating these traits in the sequence illustrated below with the E3902/WD-HT Camelina being closest to commercial launch following the completion of two successful seasons of field trials. The trait demonstrated excellent tolerance to the herbicide which we plan to use for commercial production with no impairment of seed yield. The lead lines are now in seed scale up phase while our application for non-regulated status using the RSR process is pending with USDA-APHIS. In addition, we are progressing discussions with the herbicide producers to have Camelina added to their labels, an essential step towards enabling growers to use the herbicide with Yield10's new varieties. 
The spring E3902/WD-HT varieties will be closely followed by winter WD-HT lines and then by lines containing stacked WD/IMI/SU-HT to enable broadleaf weed control and tolerance to soil residues of previously used herbicides.
We expect that our best Camelina lines currently progressing to elite variety status will be suitable for our initial commercial launch and the first tens of thousands of acres of contract production. These first Camelina seed varieties will be replaced over the next 2-4 years when the next generation varieties incorporating input traits, including herbicide tolerance and disease resistant genes, are available.  We believe that successful implementation of the input traits will be important in order to achieve broad-based farmer adoption of our elite Camelina and to achieve expansion of production in the hundreds of thousands to millions of acres scale. Input traits currently progressing separately in our pipeline will eventually be combined, or “stacked,” into our highest performing elite Camelina varieties in the future. Our goal is to have elite Camelina varieties enter commercial production in the next few years with stacked tolerance to three herbicides, stacked HT/SSU/IMI-HT traits and DMR. This development process with sequential release of improved elite Camelina varieties is illustrated above using our E3902 spring line. A similar process is being carried out in parallel for our lead winter Camelina lines. We have begun progressing early commercialization of the business based on the current best Camelina lines and the first seed product launch will be to supply feedstock oil for the renewable fuel market with the residual protein meal going into animal feed. We are currently working on seed scale up of our non-regulated spring and winter varieties of Camelina to establish our products operating business. Our commercial team has outreach to growers underway to build a grower network and to execute production contracts albeit at small scale. These activities are complemented by extensive business development outreach to seed processing facilities and prospective oil and protein meal offtake partners.
Our plan is to execute the sequential launch of our products from our Camelina oilseed platform as follows:
Products Produced by Processing Camelina Grain from Yield10 Varieties
Biofuel feedstock oil: Elite Camelina - stacked input traits and performance traits on current best varieties.  In launching our Camelina products business, we plan to provide our seed to growers under contracts with Yield10, to use existing third-party oilseed processing assets through toll arrangements and to enter into offtake agreements with end users for the oil and protein meal to address current markets, including low-carbon feedstock oil for the biofuels and protein meal for animal feed. Our technology team will continue to develop improved varieties of elite Camelina germplasm with herbicide tolerance, disease resistance, seed yield and oil content traits currently progressing through our trait pipeline. Elite Camelina varieties will serve current markets and represent a foundation for the future commercialization of our PHA bioplastic and omega-3 traits, which we will develop separately and introduce into the elite varieties by plant breeding. In order to position Yield10 to execute on this plan, we harvested our first 50 acres of Camelina seed grown under contract in Montana in 2020. During 2021 and 2022, we conducted seed scale up activities with both spring and winter Camelina lines. During August 2022, we harvested 17 acres of winter Camelina seed grown under contract in Saskatoon that we have processed and provided to growers in the U.S. and Canada under contracts for the 2022/2023 winter season.
Nutritional Products
Omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA): Elite Omega-3 Camelina - omega-3 trait. Omega-3 fatty acids are found in foods such as fish and plant oils (flaxseed, soybean, canola and Camelina oils). The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid ("ALA"), eicosapentaenoic acid ("EPA"), and docosahexaenoic acid ("DHA"). ALA is found primarily in plant oils and DHA and EPA are found in fish and other seafood. Omega-3 fatty acids provide many health benefits, including preventing and managing heart disease. The American Heart Association recommends that everyone eat fish at least twice a week, such as salmon that is high in omega-3 acids and/or adding fish oils supplements to their diets. The availability of ocean wild caught fish containing omega-3 oil used in nutritional oils and aquafarming is declining due to overfishing. We intend to launch a proprietary Camelina omega-3 seed product into the food and nutrition market based on the omega- 3 trait developed over the last 10 years by the Rothamsted Institute in the UK. Yield10 signed an Exclusive Collaboration and Option Agreement for this technology with Rothamsted in November 2020. In November 2022, Yield10 and Rothamsted agreed to extend this exclusive collaboration and option agreement until December 31, 2023. Rothamsted has progressed the omega-3 trait beyond the proof of concept stage with their completion of multiple field trials, oil production, and product validation in aquaculture feed and human nutrition studies. Under its agreement with us, Rothamsted is responsible for making improvements and further optimization of this exciting trait at their facilities in the UK. We believe the current omega-3 trait is already at a sufficient technology readiness level to begin commercialization activities for the aquaculture and nutrition markets. Yield10 will continue its focus on developing elite Camelina varieties with herbicide tolerance, disease resistance, higher yield and oil content, with the intent to breed the Rothamsted omega-3 product trait into this germplasm in the future. In the near term, Yield10 is working on the business strategy for this technology to enable production of elite omega-3 Camelina in Canada as early as the 2025 spring planting season.
PHA bioplastic: Elite PHA Camelina - PHA bioplastic trait. The second proprietary product we are developing as a sustainable replacement to petroleum-based products is the result of new technology for the large scale, low-cost production of natural biodegradable PHA bioplastic. By genetically reprogramming our Elite Camelina to produce PHA bioplastic in the seed, the harvested seed can be processed to simultaneously produce three coproducts: feedstock oil, PHA bioplastic and protein meal for animal feed. The typical costs for producing edible oils are a useful benchmark for the potential long-term cost structure for crop-based PHA bioplastics. In this scenario, crop-based PHAs could have a cost advantage over petroleum-based plastics. We successfully field tested prototype PHA bioplastic trait Camelina lines during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons. In the 2022 growing season, we planted our best prototype PHA Camelina line at acre-scale for seed process development and plastic prototyping, however, we recognize that this version of our PHA trait is at an early technology readiness level. In parallel, we are developing the next generation versions of the PHA trait targeting 10% to 20% of total seed weight as PHA bioplastic and expect to achieve initial proof of concept for two PHA copolymer targets. We believe that by producing PHA bioplastic in Camelina seed as a third seed product along with processing the seed to produce oil and protein meal, we can achieve a cost structure with the benefits of integrated economics that optimize revenue as each market fluctuates with customer demand.
Protein meal for animal feed: Camelina meal is a high-quality and high-protein meal that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), as well as by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ("CFIA") for feed use in poultry. It has also been approved by the FDA for feed use in beef cattle and by the CFIA for feed use in salmon and trout. Cold-pressed Camelina meal, which is the residual coproduct remaining after removing most of the oil, has been extensively studied for use in animal feed and proven to be well-tolerated by livestock. The meal also provides substantial health benefits when used as an animal feed. We believe Camelina meal, as a coproduct of our Elite Camelina, Elite PHA Camelina and Elite Omega-3 Camelina plant varieties, may represent a significant additional source of revenue.
R&D Revenue from Government Grants and/or Partners
Yield10 has historically sought and participated in government grants in collaboration with leading academic institutions to develop early crop innovations and to secure rights to intellectual property. We are currently a participant in a grant from the Department of Energy with Michigan State University, which is currently our primary source of grant revenue. As of December 31, 2022, $0.1 million remained to be earned under this sub-award. It is our intention to continue this practice where grant opportunities are consistent with progressing our commercial goals. Other potential sources of non-
product revenue include funded partnerships or collaborations with companies interested in the use of our GRAIN platform to identify gene targets for traits in crops of commercial interest and potential partners or customers in the Camelina products value chain.
Camelina Grain Product Revenue
In fall 2022, we signed growers' contracts with multiple growers for production at small scale ranging from 30 to 160 acres. The harvest of this grain production is expected to begin in the summer of 2023, at which time we anticipate that we will begin to recognize grain revenue in amounts scaled to the number of acres under contract. Future grain revenues will be based, among other things, on our ability to scale-up commercial seed production, engage with growers and seed retailers, and enter into offtake agreements with customers in the renewable diesel market.
Our History
We have a significant track record and expertise in the metabolic engineering (synthetic biology) of plants.
Our predecessor company Metabolix, co-founded by our CEO, was a pioneer in synthetic biology for the development of advanced PHA bioplastics production and applications technology using engineered microbes and fermentation, and as a result developed deep experience across the PHA bioplastics value chain. In addition, Metabolix supported a crop science research program to produce PHA bioplastic in crops as a potential low-cost production system and it was this crop science activity that became the foundation of Yield10. Historically, these efforts focused on producing the simplest member of the PHA family, known as PHB, which is a microbial carbon storage biopolymer, in high concentration within the seeds of oilseed crops or within the leaves of biomass crops such as switchgrass. PHA bioplastics are useful as biodegradable alternatives for petroleum-based plastics in many single use packaging and food service products.
Our Approach
Our GRAIN platform provides us with a unique approach for discovering novel yield trait genes and producing higher value sustainable products in Camelina.
We have integrated advanced metabolic flux modeling capabilities with transcriptome network analysis to form the foundation of our Gene Ranking Artificial Intelligence Network ("GRAIN") big data mining gene discovery platform. GRAIN is the gene discovery tool in our trait gene development platform, which encompasses three components: GRAIN target gene identification; modification of the target gene activity in Camelina using CRISPR genome-editing or traditional genetic engineering; and Camelina field testing. We refer to the integrated system as the Trait Factory, however, the GRAIN discovery tool is unique to Yield10. In the case of crops, the levers to increase seed yield are the metabolic infrastructure through which carbon flows from photosynthesis to seed production and the gene regulators or transcription factors, which control various pathways of plant metabolism. Over the last 20 years, the agricultural sector has generated vast numbers of data points. During this same period, however, there have been very few new crop traits produced. GRAIN is a next generation crop big data mining system based on over 30 years of advanced synthetic biology expertise and is protected by the Company as a trade secret. The system efficiently mines big data sets and prioritizes actionable gene targets to improve crop productivity. We have employed this approach to discover a range of potential yield trait genes and used the data from the traits generated in Camelina to create interest in our traits for major food crops through research license agreements. As an example, our new oil content gene trait target C3020 was previously an uncharacterized gene. GRAIN was able to select this gene target out of tens of thousands of Camelina genes and we consider the experimental results achieved with C3020 Camelina as a good proof point for the value of this platform.
We believe Camelina has high potential to become a large acreage commercial crop for producing low-carbon biofuel feedstock oils, PHA bioplastics and nutritional oils including omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) oils in North and South America.
As part of an evolution to sustainable energy, a substantial increase in renewable diesel capacity in the United States and Canada is currently underway, with proposed and funded renewable diesel facilities having a total capacity of over 6 billion gallons of biofuels per year. Renewable diesel expansion has surged due to its low-carbon footprint, federal and local subsidies to reduce carbon emissions, and its ability to be used as a drop-in replacement for petroleum diesel. Renewable 
diesel feedstock is supplied mainly from used cooking oil, animal fats (e.g., tallow), and vegetable oil, with the former two feedstock sources in short supply due to limited production capacity. Yield10 therefore expects to meet the demand of the increase in renewable diesel feedstock over the next few years. Moreover, a third of vegetable oils globally produced today are palm oils, which do not qualify for many biofuels subsidies because of their high carbon footprint. Numerous studies and regulatory approvals have shown Camelina oil’s usefulness as a low-carbon feedstock oil for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Residual Camelina protein meal remaining after oil extraction is approved by regulatory authorities for use in animal feed applications in the U.S. and Canada. Camelina’s low-carbon footprint and its ability to be grown as a cover crop on otherwise fallow land make it an attractive choice to fill the renewable diesel feedstock supply gap. Based on the assumption of 60 to 100 gallons of Camelina oil per acre, 1 billion gallons of feedstock oil would require 10 to 15 million acres of Camelina production. For comparison purposes, canola production is currently around 20 million acres per year in Canada.
Camelina also has the potential to be a platform crop for the production of proprietary crop products. It is proven to be amenable to genetic engineering through Yield10’s GRAIN platform, resulting in a number of oil and yield traits with demonstrated field trial success. Yield10 has also demonstrated proof-of-concept PHA bioplastic production in Camelina, both in the greenhouse in 2019, and in successful field trials in 2020 and 2021 producing 6% PHA bioplastic in the seed. In November 2020, Yield10 also signed an Exclusive Collaboration and Option Agreement with Rothamsted for an advanced trait technology for the production of omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) oils in Camelina.
We believe that our Camelina development capabilities, together with our yield and oil content trait improvements, enable a strong competitive advantage in building an attractive Camelina products business focused on low-carbon biofuels feedstock oils. In the long term, the potential for production of PHA biomaterials in Camelina could provide economic returns for farmers to justify very large acreage adoption. PHA biomaterials also have the potential to reduce the CI of feedstock oils from carbon savings derived through the replacement of petroleum plastics and the low-cost production of these products. PHA biomaterials with the right cost structure have applications in very large markets not currently served by agriculture, including water treatment and biodegradable bioplastic applications. We believe crop-based production will enable broad-based global adoption of these materials.
We have assembled a pipeline of crop performance traits for development that are applicable to both Camelina and major commercial crops and have established research agreements with major seed companies.
Our unique approach to crop yield or seed oil content trait discovery utilizing our GRAIN platform, which integrates advanced metabolic engineering concepts to address critical bottlenecks in carbon metabolism, has enabled us to discover a series of yield genes with potential use for producing step-change improvements in crop yield. Through our research and early development efforts we have identified and begun characterizing our C3000 and C4000 series of traits. To initially characterize the potential of yield or seed oil content trait genes, we test our trait candidates using our Camelina platform. Our objective is to identify novel yield traits that act at a fundamental level in crop metabolism to provide the potential for broad deployment of our traits across multiple crop types. Following our work with these trait genes in Camelina, we seek to enter into license agreements or form collaborations with major agricultural companies so they can incorporate our novel yield traits into their seed products.
We believe our business model will allow us to develop our Camelina products business and capture value for important new yield traits for major crops.
We are working to advance our own trait developments in Camelina for our seed products business as well as to form business alliances to progress our traits through development, launch and commercialization in major food crops. Key to our strategy is to retain control of timelines and to maximize, where possible, the opportunity for future value creation. We are focused on identifying and signing additional research and development collaborations to accelerate commercial development of our promising yield traits. Based on this strategy, Yield10 intends to focus internal resources on trait gene discovery and developing improved versions of our elite Camelina varieties for our seed products business.
We have signed non-exclusive research licenses for our novel yield traits with agriculture industry leaders.
Yield10's approach to capturing value from the utilization of its proprietary traits in major food and feed crops is to enter into research licenses with large seed companies to maximize the numbers of acres in which the traits are adopted. Our capital efficient approach for trait development in major food and feed crops is to utilize field results obtained from our work with traits in Camelina to create interest from large seed companies. We then execute non-exclusive research licenses for traits of interest, enabling these companies to progress our traits within their crop(s) of interest. These research agreements have a limited term and require data sharing with Yield10. If the work performed under these research agreements is successful, the seed companies have the right to negotiate a commercial agreement.
We have a network of commercial science advisors and collaborators to provide us with insight and opportunities to advance our industry alliances, crop research and development, and key intellectual property.
Yield10 has pursued academic collaborations that have led to the discovery of novel yield trait genes. In 2018 and 2019, Yield10 announced signing global license agreements with the University of Missouri for advanced technology to boost oil content in oilseed crops, including C3007, C3010, and C3012, which are based on the discovery of a key regulatory mechanism controlling oil production in oilseed crops and which can be used to increase oil content. In conjunction with the Rothamsted collaboration agreement, Prof. Johnathan Napier, a world-leading scientist in the development of sustainable plant omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) oil traits, also joined our advisory team.
We plan to seek U.S. and Canadian government grants and/or partners to support our research and development goals.
Yield10 has historically sought and participated in government research grants in collaboration with leading academic institutions to develop early crop innovations and to secure rights to intellectual property. We have been awarded grants over the last several years supporting research on strategies to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis, increase seed oil content, identify novel yield traits, and to test these novel traits in Camelina. This work is valuable because traits developed in Camelina also have the potential to be developed and deployed in other oilseed crops. For example, in 2017, we were selected as a sub-awardee on a DOE grant led by Michigan State University to conduct research aimed at boosting oilseed yield in Camelina. During 2020 and 2021, we received three small Canadian government research grants awarded through the Industrial Research Assistance Program administered by National Research Council Canada. We plan to continue to pursue government grants to defray research costs associated with our research and development activities. Other potential sources of non-product revenue include 1) potential partners or customers in the Camelina products value chain, and 2) funded partnerships or collaborations with companies interested in the use of our GRAIN platform to identify gene targets for traits in crops of commercial interest.
We are operating with a lean organizational footprint, which is evaluating our novel yield traits in greenhouse and field tests while maintaining efficient use of cash resources.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 30 full-time employees, with the majority directly involved with our research and development activities. We believe that our organizational capabilities align with our research priorities and are complemented by our use of third-party infrastructure and certain service providers. With this approach we can leverage third-party infrastructure and capability without having to spend the time and capital needed to recreate them in-house. This allows us to focus our limited resources on deploying our core strengths against our key development goals. We expect to grow our research and development operations and commercial seed operations over time commensurate with building value in our business and advancing our traits through commercialization while at the same time tightly managing overhead costs.
We are building capabilities in seed scale-up and certified seed production to build an inventory of Camelina seed to supply to growers under contract for producing grain suitable for offtake into the biofuels market.
As we advance field testing of our Camelina varieties, we will choose Camelina lines as lead and back-up candidates for commercialization. For instance, field tests can be conducted for a Camelina line with 20 to 100 grams of seed. As a line is selected for possible commercial sales, inventory of the seed must then be ramped up. The rule of thumb we use is that a one-acre planting of Camelina will produce sufficient seed to enable planting of 150 to 200 acres. In 2021/2022 we conducted seed scale-up activities for WDH3, our winter short cycle Camelina line as well as for WDH2, our winter cold tolerant line.  During the third quarter of 2022, we engaged growers in contracts for the production of our WDH2 and WDH3 
Camelina grain and Camelina seed having a total acreage of approximately 1,000 acres. These growers are located in the U.S. and Canada and planted between 30 and 160 acres each, with harvest expected to occur in the summer of 2023. We intend to use the seed harvest for toll crushing and further seed production that will provide us with seed inventory for future grower contracts during 2023 and beyond.
For certain spring and winter varieties in development for commercialization, including WDH2, WDH3, E3902 and certain candidate herbicide tolerant lines, we are conducting contract seed scale-up and production in contra-season at sites in South America and plan to continue seed scale-up activities in spring 2023.
Traits in Development
Yield10 has established a strong pipeline of performance and product traits in development.  In late 2020, we added programs for the deployment of input traits including herbicide tolerance and disease resistance traits for Camelina into our pipeline and prioritized this development to enable larger scale production of elite Camelina varieties for biofuel feedstock production. We also prioritized development of performance traits for increasing seed oil content ahead of seed yield traits.
INPUT TRAITS
Herbicide Tolerance and Downy Mildew Resistance
We are progressing the development of genetic traits for tolerance to Class 10 and Class 2 herbicides in Camelina. We plan to use the Class-10 herbicide glufosinate tolerance gene for management of broadleaf weeds for commercial production. We are developing glufosinate tolerant Camelina because it will fit in well with crop rotations. The genetic trait we are using has a long history of safe use in other crops including canola. We believe this approach could potentially enable faster regulatory approvals for the trait in Camelina under the SECURE Rule in the United States. We have multiple candidate glufosinate tolerant Camelina lines in our pipeline. In spring 2022, we conducted our first field testing of candidate herbicide tolerant Camelina lines in order to identify lead and back up lines for commercial development and regulatory approval. We have selected lines for further testing and seed scale-up at two sites located in the southern U.S. over winter 2022/2023, and have plans to conduct further testing and seed scale up in spring 2023.
Class 2 herbicides (imidazolonones ("IMI") and sulfonyl ureas ("SU")) are used extensively in the geographic regions we are targeting for Camelina production. Soil residues from their use in the previous growing season can impair Camelina growth. For this reason, we are progressing Class 2 tolerance traits in our Camelina pipeline based on modified versions of the ALS gene ("acetolactate synthase") to produce tolerance to both types of Class 2 herbicides. Our approach is intended to leverage trait genetics and the well-established roadmap from the successful development of IMI and SU resistance in other commercial crops.
We are progressing traits for tolerance to the fungal pathogen downy mildew, which can negatively impact Camelina seed yields. In 2021, we acquired the rights to a Camelina line with DMR and plan to evaluate it in 2023 on land having significant levels of this fungal pathogen. We also have two backup Camelina lines demonstrating partial resistance and a funded breeding program ongoing for producing additional DMR lines.
Each of these input traits are being developed independently, however once validated, our plan is to stack these traits into our current, best elite Camelina varieties.
In late 2020, we initiated an intensive effort to develop herbicide tolerance traits in Camelina. In our spring 2022 field testing program, we indicated that we would be evaluating over 30 candidate Camelina lines that have been engineered for tolerance to over-the-top spray of a commercial broadleaf weed herbicide.  In August 2022, we reported that we observed good herbicide tolerance to an established broadleaf herbicide at 1 time or 2 times the spray rate that is typically applied commercially to herbicide tolerant canola. The over-the-top spraying consisted of 2 spray applications of the broadleaf herbicide at different times of the Camelina growth cycle. In February 2023, we reported that we retested our lead commercial candidate HT spring Camelina lines in field trials in the Southern U.S. and the previous successful results were replicated. We further reported these HT spring Camelina lines were also tolerant to the application of a grassy weed control product. 
In our spring 2022 field test program, we also tested a Camelina line for tolerance to IMIs. In August 2022, we reported that our candidate IMI tolerant line has normal growth in the presence of IMI soil residues applied to the soil at 1-time or 2-times the commercially used rates, whereas the control line shows impaired growth. In 2022, our researchers developed multiple E3902 spring Camelina lines with "stacked" herbicide tolerance traits. In February 2023, we reported results from greenhouse studies indicating that we have achieved proof-of-concept for creating E3902 Camelina lines with tolerance to both over-the-top herbicide application and soil residual herbicide. We plan to conduct our first field tests of stacked herbicide tolerant E3902 spring Camelina lines in spring 2023. Our researchers have also developed candidate broadleaf herbicide tolerant winter Camelina in WDH2 and WDH3 germplasm. In recently completed greenhouse studies, these candidate winter Camelina lines demonstrated tolerance to spray application of commercial levels of a commonly used broadleaf herbicide. These events are on-track for field testing in winter 2023/2024. We are also developing “stacked” herbicide tolerance traits in our winter Camelina lines with the goal of conducting our first field tests in winter 2023/2024.
We plan to collect data on tolerance to the herbicides, seed yield and oil content data on these Camelina lines in the months ahead.
PERFORMANCE TRAITS
Seed Oil Enhancing Traits: C3007, C3008, C3009, C3010, C3012 and C3020
Yield10 is progressing a series of novel traits targeted at increasing the oil content in Camelina. We are building significant capabilities and intellectual property around key oil biosynthesis pathways in plants based on technologies for increasing oil content in seeds. Improving the oil content and yield of Camelina seed would increase the value per acre for this crop for the production of generic oils for biofuel markets in the near term and omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) oils in the future. Based on the results we obtain with Camelina, we may be able to license these traits to seed companies for use in other oilseed crops, including canola and soybean. 
We began the technical work in Camelina during 2016 with our C3008a, C3008b and C3009 traits, which regulate the production and degradation of oils in oilseed crops. In 2017 and 2018, we received confirmation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's ("USDA-APHIS") Biotechnology Regulatory Services ("BRS") that two types of our genome-edited Camelina plant lines developed using CRISPR/Cas-9 genome editing technology for increased oil content were not considered to be regulated articles under 7 CFR part 340, clearing the way for field testing in the U.S. Edits to three different gene types were made to truncate the resulting encoded proteins. These edits were designed to enhance the production of oil and decrease its turnover in mature seeds. The best line containing these modifications is designated as our triple-edited, or C3008a, C3008b and C3009 trait containing spring Camelina line E3902. We completed our first field trial with these edited Camelina lines in the U.S. during the 2019 growing season and these trials were repeated in 2020 and 2021 with the E3902 line consistently showing an approximately 4.7 percent increase in seed oil content as a percentage of overall seed weight. No significant change in oil composition was observed. In 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries in Argentina indicated that Camelina line E3902 would not be subject to regulation in that country.  We are performing activities related to seed scale-up with Camelina line E3902 including pure seed production in anticipation of potential commercial use. In 2022, the Ministry of Agriculture on Agricultural Protection in Chile indicated that Camelina line E3902 would not be subject to regulation in Chile.
In 2018, we signed an exclusive global license agreement with the University of Missouri for advanced oilseed technology, including the C3007 and C3010 gene traits, which are promising targets focused on the central role of Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase ("ACCase") a key metabolic control point for oil production. We have produced several CRISPR genome edited versions of C3007 in both Camelina and canola. Camelina contains three copies of three different BADC genes, BADC-1, BADC-2 and BADC-3 while canola contains two versions of each gene. Through a series of submissions to USDA-APHIS, we have developed several lines of Camelina and canola that USDA-APHIS BRS does not consider to be regulated under 7 CFR part 340. In addition, in late 2021 the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries in Argentina indicated that two C3007 Camelina lines would not be subject to regulation in that country.
Yield10 researchers achieved proof of concept showing that four novel gene targets identified using the GRAIN platform impact seed development and/or oil content. In greenhouse testing in 2020, one of the three targets, C3020, produced a 10% increase in seed oil content when engineered with increased activity in Camelina. Data obtained from increasing activity of the other three targets, C3019, C3021, and C3022 indicates these represent good targets for CRISPR 
genome-editing. Pure field grown seed of C3020 was produced in 2021 for subsequent larger scale evaluation in field tests. Results from the 2021 field production showed up to a 9 percent increase in oil content. 
Novel Yield Trait Genes C3003 and C3004
Internal development work with performance traits C3003 and C3004 has been paused to focus resources on the development of our input traits and oil content traits. C3003 is an algal gene, in-licensed from the University of Massachusetts. We believe, based on GRAIN modeling and early positive results, that C3003 reduces the well-understood yield losses that occur through photorespiration, a side reaction of photosynthesis in C3 crops. Simplot is working with C3003 in their potato programs. Our C3004 gene trait was identified based on molecular genetic analysis of C3003 Camelina. In studies conducted between 2018 and 2021, stable C3004 Camelina lines with increased expression of C3004 resulted in a significant increase in plant growth and vigor, increased branching and seed yield, and in some cases increased individual seed weight. We currently have research license agreements in place with seed companies to evaluate the Camelina C3004 gene in soybean and potato.
C4000 Series Traits
Simplot is testing the C4001 trait in potato. We expect evaluation of C4000 series traits in these target crops will continue to advance during 2023. Traits in this series and the proof points we expect to generate may provide us with an opportunity to selectively partner with others for the development of these traits in major commercial food, feed, and forage crops.
PRODUCT TRAITS
PHA Bioplastic Trait
PHA bioplastics are produced today using sugar or vegetable oil feedstocks by fermentation of microorganisms. Fermentation-based production of PHAs is constrained by the high capital cost of manufacturing facilities and the high processing costs resulting from feedstock conversion losses due to the inefficiency of converting sugar or oils to PHA. For example, it requires over 3 pounds of sugar to produce 1 pound of PHA or 1.5 - 2 pounds of vegetable oil to produce 1 pound of PHA, making the feedstock cost alone very high. These types of processes also require other manufacturing inputs and are energy intensive. We believe crop-based production will enable an advantaged cost structure thereby eliminating a barrier to entry for large-scale adoption of PHA materials for use as renewable, biodegradable plastic replacement in many single use food serviceware and packing applications. Another application of PHAs includes wastewater treatment.
Seeds are natural, stable storage sites for large amounts of oil and proteins deposited by plants to nourish seedlings following seed germination in the field. The stability of seeds at ambient temperatures allows them to be readily harvested, transported and stored prior to processing, and makes them the ideal vehicle for crop seed production of PHA bioplastics. The key concept is to introduce the PHA bioplastic as a new component of the seed composition and by processing the PHA bioplastic producing seed, to produce oil, polymer, and protein rich seed meal. We believe this can be done in a capital efficient manner using incremental capital added to an existing oilseed facility. The combination of all three products improves the overall value proposition and we believe that in time this will result in PHA bioplastics costs ultimately in line with canola and soybean oils. Yield10 plans to develop and commercialize Camelina seed-based PHA bioplastics by selling a resin grade PHA bioplastic raw material to the bioplastics industry. The Company is actively pursuing business development opportunities to identify and secure partnerships for plastics replacement markets.
Yield10 filed a U.S. patent application in 2019 for new technology potentially enabling low-cost production of PHA biomaterials in the seeds of Camelina. The Yield10 patent application describes a discovery around maintaining the viability and vigor of Camelina seed programmed to produce high levels of the PHA biomaterial PHB. By introducing the three genes encoding the pathway for producing PHA from the plant metabolite acetyl-CoA, we have demonstrated the production of up to 10 percent PHB in seeds of Camelina with good seedling viability in growth chambers. We currently have two PHA biomaterial traits, C3014 and C3015, in our development pipeline and we carried out successful field tests in 2020 and 2021. We are now progressing to scale up the best prototype line, based on the C3015 trait, which showed PHA levels of up to 6% 
seed weight, to begin early product prototyping and market development studies for feed and water treatment applications. In 2022, we completed a 3-acre scale-up of this line. In parallel, we have a research and development program underway to optimize and develop commercial quality PHA trait lines based on insights from the field tests and our GRAIN platform with a goal to achieve 10 - 20% PHA in seed.
Omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) oil trait
The omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) oil trait, for which Yield10 has secured an option to commercial rights, is being developed by the research team at Rothamsted as part of their program to develop a sustainable drop-in replacement for fish oil used in the production of aquaculture feed. Yield10 is providing financial support to the ongoing Rothamsted program and has secured an exclusive option to commercialize the technology and improvements made during the term of the agreement. In November 2022, Yield10 and Rothamsted agreed to a no-cost extension of the exclusive option and license agreement until December 31, 2023.
The most important omega-3 fatty acids for human health are ALA, DHA and EPA and the primary source of these is fish in the diet. These omega-3 fatty acids are produced by algae, where they are thought to protect their cell membranes in cold water. The algal omega-3 oils progress up the food chain and accumulate in fish and eventually into the human diet. Northern Hemisphere fish oil contains approximately 10% DHA and 10% EPA. Camelina oil already contains the omega-3 fatty acid ALA and the Rothamsted Institute has developed engineered Camelina lines, which produce approximately 20% of DHA+EPA fatty acids, similar to the composition of Northern Hemisphere fish oil. A number of these Camelina lines have been successfully field tested by Rothamsted and us during the last four years at different locations within the UK, Canada and the U.S. with oil samples produced for salmon and human feeding studies. Rothamsted is continuing its research program to further improve the oil composition of Camelina oil with the goal of developing a land-based production system for a Camelina oil composition as a drop in replacement for Southern Hemisphere fish oils, which has an DHA+EPA fatty acid content in the oil of approximately 30%. We believe there may be intellectual property challenges related to the production of omega-3 oils in crops in North America until certain existing patents in Canada expire during 2025. We are currently progressing business development activities to determine the feasibility of progressing the omega-3 Camelina in North America in the near term. However, in the interim, Yield10 will focus its research and development efforts on developing advanced Camelina germplasm with the intention to introduce the omega-3 trait in the future.
 Regulatory Requirements
Since the first successful commercialization of a biotechnology-derived agricultural crop in the 1990s, many new crop varieties have been developed and made available to farmers in the U.S. and worldwide. U.S. farmers have rapidly adopted many of these new biotechnology-derived varieties. According to the USDA, in 2020 over 90 percent of U.S. corn, upland cotton and soybeans planted in the U.S. were varieties produced through traditional forms of genetic engineering. A significant percentage of the production of other crops planted and harvested in the U.S., such as alfalfa, papaya and sugar beet are also biotechnology-derived.
Biotechnology-derived or genetically engineered ("GE") crops are subject to a significant amount of regulation in the U.S. and worldwide. Field tests and field trials of such crops need to ensure that traits in development do not escape or mix with native plants, and crops that may be used in human and animal food chain must meet certain safety standards. Government regulations, regulatory systems and the political environment that influence them vary significantly among jurisdictions.
For purposes of this discussion, the term “GE” includes both biotechnology-derived or genetically engineered plants that are modified by the insertion of recombinant DNA (“Traditional Genome Modification”). Biotechnology-derived or genetically engineered plants can also be modified through the application of more modern techniques of genome editing. We have seed traits that fall within each of these two generalized categories of GE plants, as summarized above under the subheading “Traits in Development.”
United States Regulation
The U.S. government agencies primarily responsible for overseeing the products of modern agricultural biotechnology are the USDA, the FDA and the EPA. Depending on its characteristics, a product may be subject to the jurisdiction of one or more of these agencies under the federal government’s 1986 Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology, as updated. Regulatory officials from the three agencies regularly communicate and exchange information to ensure that any safety or regulatory issues that may arise are appropriately resolved within the scope of authority afforded to each agency under their respective statutes. Other environmental laws or regulations also apply, depending on the specific product and its potential applications or intended uses. Our business strategy for major grain crops is to develop yield and performance traits for licensing to the major seed companies.
Our seed traits and any future products that are successfully developed containing our seed traits are subject to USDA, FDA and EPA regulatory requirements. Those requirements will vary depending on the particular seed trait and the type and intended use of any product that will be commercialized. Future products that we plan to produce and sell, for example deployment of herbicide tolerant traits, are likely to have EPA regulatory requirements, and the regulations relating to manufacturing and consumer protection will also need to be addressed.
Within USDA, APHIS administers the regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ‘‘Introduction of organisms and products altered or produced through genetic engineering which are plant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests.’’ These regulations govern the introduction (importation, interstate movement, or release into the environment) of certain GE organisms. Along with the EPA and the FDA, APHIS is responsible for the oversight and review of GE organisms.
On May 18, 2020, the USDA updated the biotechnology regulations in the Plant Protection Act (7 C.F.R. Part 340) and set up a new paradigm called the Sustainable, Ecological, Consistent, Uniform, Responsible, Efficient (“SECURE”) rule. This Act establishes updated regulations for importation, interstate movement, and environmental release of GE organisms and products. It provides exemptions for plants if the genetic modification is solely a deletion of any size, or the genetic modification is a single base pair substitution or if the genetic modification is solely introducing nucleic acid sequences from within the plant’s natural gene pool. Exemptions also apply if the modification is from editing nucleic acid sequences in a plant to correspond to a sequence known to occur in that plant’s natural gene pool or if the plant is an offspring of a GE plant and does not retain the genetic modification in the GE plant parent. In addition to the above, § 340.1(c) states that modified plants would not be subject to the regulations if they have plant-trait mechanism of action (“MOA”) combinations that are the same as those of modified plants for which APHIS has conducted a regulatory status review and found not to be subject to the regulations under part 340. The focus rests on the organism itself rather than the methods and technologies used to generate it, which is important given improvements in delivery and genome editing modalities over the past 33 years.
Seed traits developed using Traditional Genome Modification, such as our C3003 yield trait that leverages the biological functions of an algal gene, are regulated under 7 CFR part 340. Regulated articles are subject to extensive USDA-APHIS oversight, including but not limited to permitting requirements for import, handling, interstate movement and release into the environment. In recent years, we have obtained determinations from USDA-APHIS that some of our genome edited lines are exempted from the 7 CFR part 340 framework administered by the agency. In cases (i) through (iv) below, USDA-APHIS's Biotechnology Regulatory Services approved our petitions and confirmed that each of these novel plant lines would not be treated as a regulated article through the previous APHIS “Am I Regulated?” process.
(i) The single trait C3008 Camelina plant line, developed using CRISPR genome editing technology for increased oil content.
(ii) The triple-edited Camelina line E3902 that combines three gene traits, C3008a, C3008b and C3009, to increase oil production.
(iii) The Camelina CRISPR edited line edited for the C3007 trait for increased oil production in Camelina.
(iv) The canola CRISPR edited line edited for the C3007 trait for improved oil production in canola.
To our knowledge, our triple-edited Camelina line E3902 which was determined to not be regulated under 7 CFR part 340 in September 2018, is the first CRISPR-edited triple-trait plant determined by the agency to be not to be regulated under 7 CFR part 340. Since 2018, our CRISPR-edited lines that are exempt from regulation by APHIS (under 7 CFR part 340) have been studied in field tests conducted in the U.S. We expect to continue to make appropriate use of SECURE Rule procedures to clarify the regulatory status of our new GE seed traits as they are developed.
In 2020, the regulatory exemptions and confirmation process under the SECURE rule took effect, representing the first comprehensive revision of APHIS’ biotechnology regulations since 1987. The revisions enable APHIS to regulate organisms developed using genetic engineering for plant pest risk with greater precision and reduces the regulatory burden for developers of organisms that are unlikely to pose plant pest risks. Once a specific plant developed through genetic engineering is found not to require regulation, new varieties of the plant containing the same genetic modification would similarly not be regulated. Since the new process was enacted, certain of our CRISPR edited Camelina C3007 lines have been confirmed by APHIS as being exempt from regulation by USDA-APHIS under 7 CFR part 340. In addition, in 2022 we filed a request under the SECURE Rule for Regulatory Status Review (RSR) with USDA-APHIS Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS) for herbicide tolerant Camelina. As of March 2023, a response from the agency is pending. 
The EPA is responsible under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act for regulating pesticides with public health uses, as well as ensuring that these products do not pose unintended or unreasonable risks to humans, animals and the environment. For herbicide-tolerant crops the EPA regulates the herbicide while the USDA-APHIS regulates the crops. The EPA establishes tolerances for the allowable amount of herbicide residues that may remain on the crop. Tolerances, as defined by the EPA, are “the maximum amount of a pesticide allowed to remain in or on a food” as part of the process of regulating pesticides.
Separate from approval for genetic modifications from USDA-APHIS regulations under 7 CFR part 340, a GE plant also will be regulated by the FDA if it is intended to be used as human food or animal feed. The FDA regulates the safety of food for humans and animals, and foods derived from GE plants must meet the same food safety requirements as foods derived from traditionally bred plants (also called “conventional foods”).
Since 1992, the FDA has had in place a voluntary consultation process for developers of bioengineered food (“Biotechnology Consultations”). Final agency decisions and other information from these Biotechnology Consultations are made publicly available by the FDA. Biotechnology Consultations are data-intensive and examine the new food product’s safety and nutritional profile, among other issues. Generally, the FDA has found that such food products do not pose unique health risks to humans or animals, but if a novel allergen or other distinction from the conventional food is present in the new plant variety, the agency may require specific label statements on the product to ensure that consumers are made aware of material differences between GE and conventional versions. The FDA primarily derives its regulatory power from the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which has been amended over time by several subsequent laws. Among other oversight and inspection responsibilities, the FDA regulates ingredients, packaging, and labeling of foods, including nutrition and health claims and the nutrition facts panel. Foods are typically not subject to premarket review and approval requirements, with limited exceptions.
As part of a broader effort to modernize its regulatory approach to all biotechnology-derived products, the FDA is currently re-evaluating its regulatory approach in light of the increasing prevalence of certain genome edited plants. In January 2017, the FDA asked for public input to help inform its thinking about human and animal foods derived from new plant varieties produced using genome editing techniques. Among other things, the FDA’s request for comments asked for data and information in response to questions about the safety of foods from genome edited plants, such as whether certain categories of genome edited plants present food safety risks different from other plants produced through traditional plant breeding.
In October 2018, FDA leadership issued a document entitled the “Plant and Animal Biotechnology Innovation Action Plan” (the “Action Plan”) that identified three key priorities for the agency in this area: 1) advancing human and animal health by promoting product innovation and applying modern, efficient and risk-based regulatory pathways; 2) strengthening public outreach and communication regarding the FDA’s approach to innovative plant and animal biotechnology; and 3) increasing engagement with domestic and international partners on biotechnology issues. The Action Plan also stated that the FDA has reviewed the comments and other information it received in response to the January 2017 request for comments, and that it intends to develop guidance for the industry explaining how the FDA’s existing regulatory policy for foods derived from new plant varieties applies to foods produced using genome editing. The FDA also stated in the Action Plan that it intends to begin updating the existing procedures for voluntary Biotechnology Consultations to reflect the agency’s 25 years of experience with foods derived from biotechnology plants and to incorporate any additional issues related to genome editing of food crops. Such procedural updates are expected to be developed and implemented over the next two years.
Canadian Regulation
In Canada, GE crops, and the food products into which they are incorporated, are regulated by multiple government agencies under a federal framework for the regulation of biotechnology products that is similar to the U.S. system. First, the CFIA is the lead agency for ensuring that a new agricultural biotechnology crop will not pose new risks to Canadian plants, animals, and other agricultural commodities. The Plant Biosafety Office ("PBO") is responsible for conducting environmental assessments of biotechnology-derived plants, referred to as "plants with novel traits" ("PNT"). Authority for the PBO includes both approving confined field trials with the PNT through permits and authorizing their “unconfined release” as a first step towards commercialization. PNTs are defined in the Canadian Seeds Regulations (i) as plants into which a trait or traits have been intentionally introduced, and (ii) where the trait is new in Canada and has the potential to impact the environment. The CFIA also has in place a remutation policy, whereby plants containing the same mutation as a previously authorized plant of the same species are included in the authorization of the original PNT and are therefore subject to the same conditions. 
Under the Food and Drugs Act and related regulations, Health Canada is responsible for reviewing a pre-market safety assessment that must be submitted by the manufacturer or importer of a “novel food,” a term of art that includes any PNT or other biotechnology-derived foods. The safety assessment should provide assurances that the novel food is safe when prepared or consumed according to its intended use before it enters the Canadian market and food system. A multi-disciplinary team of experts from Health Canada evaluates the data and information about the novel food and make a determination regarding whether it is safe and nutritious before it can be sold in Canada, as well as whether any restrictions are warranted under applicable law or the product’s safety profile.  Health Canada’s final decision documents regarding the safety of these novel foods are made available to the public by the government. As in the U.S., approval of a PNT or a novel food product does not take into account the method with which such product was produced. Rather, Health Canada employs a product-based (as opposed to a process-based) approach to its regulatory oversight of such emerging foods and food ingredients.
As the lead agency for public health and safety, Health Canada also works in conjunction with the CFIA on food labeling oversight when it identifies a potential health or safety issues with a food that could be mitigated through labeling or other disclosures. For example, if the biotechnology-derived food contains a new allergen that is otherwise not present in the conventional version of the food, then specific label statements are required to alert consumers to that important health information. However, the CFIA has primary oversight over non-health issues related to food labeling, packaging, and advertising. Accordingly, the CFIA is the lead agency for ensuring that food labeling and advertising meet the legal requirements of the Food and Drugs Act, and that labeling representations do not create a potential risk of fraud or consumer confusion and are compliant with Canada’s voluntary disclosure standard for GE food ingredients.
Environment Canada is also available to serve as a regulatory “safety net” if a novel product does not naturally fall within the jurisdiction of the CFIA, Health Canada, or the Pest Management Regulatory Agency that oversees pesticide products.
Our work involving the development, greenhouse testing, and field testing of novel yield trait genes in crop plants requires certain government and municipal permits, and we must ensure compliance with all applicable regulations, including regulations relating to GE crops. With laboratories and greenhouses in both the U.S. and Canada, we are also subject to regulations governing the shipment of seeds and other plant material (including GE seeds and GE plant material) between our facilities in the U.S. and Canada, including USDA-APHIS and CFIA permits for the import and phytosanitary certificates for the export of plant materials that could pose a risk to domestic agriculture.
Having deployed our own research and development operations in Saskatoon, Canada in 2010, we have been conducting field studies of various yield traits in that country since 2016 under PNT permits issued by Canadian regulators. In recent years, we have conducted field studies in Canada of multiple traits including our PHA bioplastic trait, under PNT permits.
Regulation in Other Jurisdictions
Other jurisdictions and governmental authorities, including in South America and Asia, are increasingly taking an interest in regulating agricultural products of biotechnology. Regulatory approaches vary by jurisdiction, including the existing public health framework and phytosanitary laws in the country, and other less tangible factors such as cultural and religious norms that may have an impact on individual country risk assessments and decision-making. We cannot predict future changes in the global regulatory landscape regarding GE plants subjected to Traditional Genome Modification or GE 
plants subjected to genome editing. Further, although U.S. and Canadian regulatory authorities have taken similar approaches to overseeing both traditional biotechnology-derived plants and genome edited plants under their national plant health and biosafety laws, regulation of all GE plants in the EU is significantly more stringent than in North America. U.S. and Canadian regulators have also determined that genome edited GE plants pose fewer risks that those subjected to Traditional Genome Modification. A July 2018, Court of Justice of the European Union legal ruling indicates that the existing European regulations for GE plants modified by the insertion of recombinant DNA should be strictly applied to genome edited plants as well. There is thus a sharp distinction between how European and North American regulatory agencies oversee novel seed traits, including those that are generated using the more modern techniques of genome editing. Although we are not currently targeting European markets for the development or commercialization of our products, the EU approach to regulating GE plants without regard to the scientific distinctions between Traditional Genome Modification and directed genome editing could be adopted by emerging oversight regimes for GE products in other jurisdictions. However, an increasing number of countries that dominate GE crop production such as Argentina, Brazil and China are adopting a more favorable regulatory approach towards genome edited plants that do not contain foreign DNA by equating the crops to conventionally bred varieties. This approach first implemented by Argentina, followed by many other countries, demonstrates the evolving landscape for GE crops informed by over 25 years of regulation and GE crop production.
In 2020, Japan published final guidelines for genome edited plants and food that state that these can be sold to the public, without the need for pre-market authorization provided they meet the criteria of being similar to products of traditional breeding.
In December 2021, Yield10 received a favorable determination from the Argentine Biosafety Commission that our genome edited Camelina lines, E3902 and the two C3007 lines, developed for increased oil content, were similar to conventional bred Camelina varieties and are not regulated under the biotechnology resolution No. 763/11 of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries in Argentina. In practice, the Argentinian authorities have confirmed that because the genome edited Camelina lines do not contain any foreign inserted DNA, these varieties can be marketed in Argentina like conventional Camelina varieties without the need for any pre-market authorizations. 
In fourth quarter 2022, the Agricultural Protection Division – Forestry and Seeds in Chile indicated that our genome edited E3902 Camelina line is not under the scope of the Chilean Biotechnology Crops Resolution No. 1523 of 2001, and its amendments regarding GMOs confirming that this line is considered not regulated (non-GM) in Chile and can be cultivated like conventional crops. 
In January 2022, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs published new guidelines for the review and approval of genome edited crops and products paving the way for faster commercialization in that country.
In-License Agreements 
Exclusive Collaboration Agreement with Rothamsted Research 
 On November 12, 2020, Yield10 signed an exclusive collaboration agreement with Rothamsted to support Rothamsted’s Flagship Program to develop omega-3 oils in Camelina. The technology developed by Rothamsted could enable the sustainable, plant-based production of omega-3 (EPA, DHA+EPA) nutritional oils that closely mimic the composition of Southern Hemisphere fish oil, an important ingredient in the production of aquaculture feed. Omega-3 oils are also essential for human nutrition and have demonstrated benefits in heart health. Rothamsted is a world-leading nonprofit research center based in Harpenden, UK, that focuses on strategic agricultural science to the benefit of farmers and society worldwide. Over the last decade, the team led by Professor Johnathan Napier, Ph.D., Science Director, has demonstrated the production of EPA, DHA+EPA oils in Camelina seed. In addition, Prof. Napier’s team has carried out multi-year field trials and multiple feeding studies with research partners using the EPA, DHA+EPA Camelina oil in different fish species. Their partners have included at least one major aquafeed company. Under the agreement, Yield10 has provided financial support for Prof. Napier’s ongoing research including further EPA, DHA+EPA trait improvement, field testing and nutritional studies. As part of the agreement, Yield10 received an exclusive two-year option to sign a global, exclusive or non-exclusive license agreement to the technology. In November 2022, Yield10 and Rothamsted agreed to extend the collaboration agreement, including the license option, without additional funding support, through December 31, 2023. Under this collaboration, Yield10 will monitor the ongoing progress by Rothamsted while developing the business plan for the initial commercial launch, which is expected to serve the salmon feed market in Chile.
License Agreement with the University of Missouri
Pursuant to a license agreement with the University of Missouri (“UM”) dated as of May 17, 2018, we have an exclusive, worldwide license to two novel gene technologies to boost oil content in crops. Both technologies are based on significant new discoveries around the function and regulation of ACCase, a key rate-limiting enzyme involved in oil production. The first technology, named C3007, is a gene for a negative controller that inhibits the enzyme activity of ACCase. The second technology, named C3010, is a gene which, if over-expressed, results in increased activity of ACCase. The UM license was expanded during May 2019 to include an exclusive worldwide license to a third gene in the ACCase complex, that we have designated C3012, that may complement the activity of C3007 to boost oil content in crops.
Pursuant to the UM license agreement, we are required to use diligent efforts to develop licensed products throughout the licensed field and to introduce licensed products into the commercial market. In that regard, we are obligated to fulfill certain research, development, and regulatory milestones relating to C3007, C3010 and C3012, including completion of multi-site field demonstrations of a crop species in which C3007, C3010 and C3012 have been introduced, and filing for regulatory approval of a crop species in which C3007, C3010 and C3012 have been introduced within a specified period. Our failure to achieve any milestone provided for under the license agreement would give UM the right to terminate the license agreement or render it nonexclusive, unless we are able to reach agreement with UM as to the potential adjustment of the applicable milestone.
We are obligated to pay UM a license execution payment, milestone payments relating to any regulatory filings and approvals covered by the license agreement, royalties on any sales of licensed products following regulatory approval, as well as a percentage of any sublicense royalties related to the licensed products.
We may terminate the license agreement at any time upon 90 days’ prior written notice to UM. Either party may terminate the license agreement upon written notice for a breach that is not cured within 30 days after receiving written notice of the breach. In addition, UM may terminate the license agreement with respect to certain patent rights immediately upon written notice in the event we contest the validity or enforceability of such patent rights.
Competitive Landscape for our Business
•Camelina Oilseed and Alternative Cover Crops
•PHA Biomaterials
•Omega-3 Oil
•Trait Licensing: Agricultural Industry Landscape
Camelina Oilseed and Alternative Cover Crops: Camelina, because it is not currently a major food crop, has been of recent interest in North America for large-scale production of feedstock oil for biofuels, both renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.  We believe that there is a growing interest among oilseed crushers and energy companies in sourcing non-food, low CI feedstock oil for supplying the biofuel market. Camelina is attractive, not only as a spring rotation crop, but also as a winter cover crop, enabling a second oil harvest annually for each acre planted. The general interest in cover crops has been steadily increasing over the last several years. The companies focusing on Camelina include Sustainable Oils, S&W Seed, and Smart Earth. There have also been recent investments in oilseed cover crop alternatives to Camelina including the development of carinata by NuSeed and the efforts by CoverCress Inc. over the last several years to develop pennycress as a cover crop for the mid-west corn and soybean belt. 
PHA Bioplastics: Third party PHA producers are pursuing fermentation-based production systems to produce PHA bioplastics for the biodegradables market. These producers include Cheil Jedang, or CJ, of South Korea (which acquired the fermentation and polymer processing technology from Yield10 in 2016 when we were still named Metabolix Inc.), Kaneka of Japan, and Danimer Scientific. Danimer has a bioplastics compounding business that produces PHAs from fermentation of seed oils and has developed revenuegenerating relationships with a number of brand owners and consumer products companies. There are also a number of smaller pre-commercial PHA bioplastic companies, all of which, to our knowledge, are based on fermentation platforms in North America and in China. Although these companies use genetically engineered microbes and feedstocks from GMO crops for their fermentation processes, some brand owners may prefer to accept the higher cost structure for the fermentation-derived PHA bioplastic as compared to PHA Camelina because they are not made from a GMO crop.
Omega-3 Oil: The growing demand for alternative sustainable sources of fish oil for human nutrition, pharmaceutical, and aquafeed applications has made this an attractive area for investment by several companies. Alternative sources include microbial fermentation processes commercialized by Veramaris (the joint venture between Evonic and DSM, with a production facility in Blair, Nebraska) and by Archer Daniels Midland Co. (with a production facility in Clinton, Iowa). On the crop-based production side, two different genetically engineered varieties of the oilseed canola have been developed and approved by USDA-APHIS to address this growing demand. BASF Plant Sciences has developed a canola variety that produces low amounts of the omega-3 fatty acid EPA and the Australian company Nuseed has developed a canola variety that produces the omega-3 fatty acid DHA in the oil. BASF currently has patents on genes for the production of omega-3 oils in canola dating back to applications made on or before 2005. NuSeed exclusively licensed patents on the production of omega-3 oils in canola from Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). We believe the Rothamsted technology which enables production of omega-3 EPA, DHA+EPA oil has higher potential as a drop-in replacement for fish oil in aquafeed.
Trait Licensing: Agricultural Industry Landscape: Following advances in biotechnology in the 1970s through the early 1990s, the first GM crops were commercially introduced in the U.S. in the mid-1990s. Today, the U.S. leads the world in the adoption of GM crops in terms of crop value and acreage planted. GM crops (also referred to as GMO or Agbiotech) have had both supporters and detractors over the years. Consumer sentiment about the safety of GM crops have limited the introduction and adoption of GM crops in Europe. However, recent studies by the National Academy of Science continue to support the 20-year history of safe use of GM crops.
The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA), an industry research group, reported that 470 million acres worldwide were planted with GM crops during 2019, the most recent year for which data is available. The planting of GM crops is centered in the Americas with North America and South America each representing approximately 44 percent of the total worldwide acres. China and India follow with approximately 8 percent and the balance of the total worldwide GM crop acreage during 2019. The remaining GM acreage was planted in the EU and the rest of world. The primary GM crops in the U.S. are corn, soybean, cotton and sugar beet. In Canada, the oilseed crop canola is the primary GM crop. Cotton is the primary GM crop grown in India and China.
In contrast to the Americas, the EU has been resistant to the adoption of GM crops and has relied heavily on plant breeding programs for capturing crop yield improvements over the last 20 years. In 2019, Spain was the largest producer of GM crops in Europe, based on cultivation of GM corn representing approximately 20 percent of the country’s crop that year. Certain GM crops have been approved for cultivation in some European countries, while other countries have imposed outright bans on cultivation of GM crops.
According to the market sector research and analytics firm, Markets and Markets, the total global seed market was estimated at $63 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow to more than $86 billion by 2026. According to the ISAAA, in 2019 the global adoption of biotech crops was recorded for 72 countries with 29 planting and an additional 43 importing for food, feed, and processing. That year, a total of 190.4 million hectares of biotech crops were grown in 29 countries. The top five biotech crop growing countries worldwide are the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and India. The traits being commercialized today by the agricultural industry mainly address crop protection, which involves preventing crop damage by weeds, insects and other pests that lower expected crop yield. As technology has advanced, “trait stacking,” or the practice of adding multiple traits to an elite plant line, has become commonplace as a strategy to protect yield. As the industry has developed, the practice of inter-licensing traits between research and development driven seed companies has led to a proliferation of branded seed products on the market today.
The GM seed business in North America is dominated by large multinational companies and their subsidiaries including BASF Corporation, Bayer Crop Science, Corteva Agriscience, Syngenta, and AgReliant Genetics, LLC. These companies have significant resources, extensive experience and track records of successfully developing, testing and commercializing high performing seed lines as well as new traits for GM crops. They offer farmers conventional and biotechnology seeds as well as crop protection chemicals, biologicals, fertilizers and other products and technologies aimed at supporting the on-farm efficiency of managing crops in the field as well as managing the overall cost of crop production through to successful harvest.
Privately owned, U.S. retail seed companies play a key role in the industry by developing, marketing and selling high performing seed to U.S. farmers. These companies include Beck’s Hybrids and Stine Seed, which have capabilities in both biotechnology and plant breeding. They source traits from the multinational companies and input these traits into elite plant germplasm to produce seeds optimized for a variety of soil, climate and field conditions. Both companies offer a broad arrange of GM corn and soybean products to their customers.
 Recent advances in biotechnology, including gene editing, have led to the formation of companies focusing on yield trait discovery, biologicals for pest control, agbiome strategies and precision agriculture. There are startups, privately held and publicly traded companies involved in this space. Such companies include AgBiome LLC, Arcadia Biosciences, Inc., Benson Hill Biosystems, Inc., BioCeres S.A., Calyxt, Inc., Cibus Ltd., Evogene Ltd., Inari Agriculture, Inc., Indigo Agriculture, Inc., Kaiima Bio-Agritech Ltd., and Pairwise Plants LLC, many of which have greater resources and experience than we have.
Intellectual Property
Our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. As of December 31, 2022, we owned or held exclusive rights to 19 patent families, including 15 issued patents and 41 pending patent applications, related to advanced technologies for increasing yield in crops, in the United States and throughout the world. As part of our agreement with Rothamsted, we have an exclusive option to license two patent families, RR213 and RR305, including six issued patents and four pending applications, including both the original patent filing for the production of EPA, DHA+EPA oil in Camelina and for an improvement patent filed after the agreement was signed. Our portfolio of patent applications includes plant science technologies we have in-licensed globally and exclusively from the University of Massachusetts related to the yield trait gene C3003 and other advanced technologies based on advanced metabolic engineering methods to improve carbon capture and selectively control carbon partitioning in plants. Our portfolio of patent applications also includes advanced technologies for oilseed crops that we in-licensed globally and exclusively from the University of Missouri in 2018 and 2019 related to the yield trait genes C3007, C3010 and C3012.
We continue to seek, develop and evaluate new technologies and related intellectual property that might enhance our business strategy, industry position or deployment options.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 30 full-time employees. Of those employees, 24 were in research and development. Among our staff, 15 hold Ph.D.’s and 11 hold masters’ or bachelors’ degrees in their respective disciplines. Our technical staff has expertise in the following areas: plant genetics, plant biology, microbial genetics, bioinformatics, metabolic engineering and systems biology. Our headquarters is located in Massachusetts, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Yield10 Oilseeds Inc. ("YOI"), maintains a research and development facility, including greenhouse facilities, in Saskatoon, Canada. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Talent Acquisition and Retention
We recognize that our employees largely contribute to our success. To this end, we support business growth by seeking to attract and retain best-in-class talent. We use internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled candidates for open positions. We believe that we are able to attract and retain superior talent as measured by our minimal turnover rate and high employee service tenure.
Total Rewards
Our total rewards philosophy has been to create investment in our workforce by offering a competitive compensation and benefits package for the two geographies in which we have offices. We provide employees with compensation packages that include base salary, annual incentive bonuses, and long-term equity incentive awards. We also offer comprehensive employee benefits, such as life, disability, and health insurance as well as flexible spending accounts, paid time off, and a 401(k) plan. It is our expressed intent to be an employer of choice in our industry by providing a market-competitive compensation and benefits package.
Health, Safety, and Wellness
The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is a priority in which we have always invested and will continue to do so. We provide our employees with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs. Program benefits are intended to provide protection and security, so employees can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that may impact their financial well-being. 
These investments and the prioritization of employee health, safety, and wellness took on particular significance in 2020 through 2022 in light of COVID-19. To protect and support our team members, we implemented health and safety measures that included maximizing personal workspaces, altering work schedules, and providing personal protective equipment. To aid in containing the spread of COVID-19, we also implemented remote-work options and limited employee travel. We continue to monitor this rapidly evolving situation and will continue to seek programs to educate and assist employees whenever possible.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We believe a diverse workforce is critical to our success. Our mission is to value differences in races, ethnicities, religions, nationalities, genders, ages, and sexual orientations, as well as education, skill sets and experience. We are focused on inclusive hiring practices, fair and equitable treatment, organizational flexibility, and training and resources.
