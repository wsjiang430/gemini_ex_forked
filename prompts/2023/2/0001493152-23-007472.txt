Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We are a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company commercializing a portfolio of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions with a focus on photodynamic therapy (“PDT”) and topical antibiotics. The Company’s licensed products are used for the treatment of actinic keratoses, which are pre-cancerous skin lesions, as well as impetigo, a bacterial skin infection.
 
Biofrontera Inc. includes its wholly owned subsidiary Bio-FRI GmbH, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Germany. Our subsidiary, Bio-FRI was formed on February 9, 2022, as a German presence to facilitate our relationship with the Ameluz Licensor. 
 
Company Overview
 
We were formed in March 2015 as Biofrontera Inc., a Delaware corporation, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Biofrontera AG, a stock corporation organized under the laws of Germany. On November 2, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering and subsequently we ceased to be deemed a company controlled by Biofrontera AG. As of December 31, 2022, Biofrontera AG held 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. With our national commercial team, we generate revenue by selling our licensed products directly to dermatology offices and groups. 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, the company had 81 employees all of which were full-time employees and approximately 57% are focused on marketing and sales activities. Our commercial team covers the continental United States, and our headquarters is in Woburn, MA.
 
Significant customers
 
We have a wide and diverse customer base with no single customer dominating our revenues. At December 31, 2022, no customer represented more than 10% of the net accounts receivable balance. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no customer represented more than 10% of net revenues.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our principal objective is to improve patient outcomes by increasing the sales of our licensed products. The key elements of our strategy include the following:
 

● | expand our sales in the United States of Ameluz® in combination with the BF-RhodoLED® lamp series for the treatment of minimally to moderately thick actinic keratoses of the face and scalp and positioning Ameluz® to be standard of care in the United States by growing our dedicated sales and marketing infrastructure in the United States; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | expand sales of Xepi® for treatment of impetigo by improving the market positioning of the licensed product; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | leverage the potential for future approvals and label extensions of our licensed portfolio products that are in the pipeline for the U.S. market through our license and supply agreements with the Licensors; and 
● | opportunistically add complementary products or services to our portfolio by acquiring or licensing IP to further leverage our commercial infrastructure and customer relationships. 

 
By executing these four strategic objectives, we will fuel company growth, deepen our trusted relationships in the dermatology community, and above all, help patients live healthier, more fulfilling lives.
 
Ameluz® and RhodoLED® Lamp Series
 
Our principal licensed product is Ameluz®, which is a prescription drug approved for use in combination with the RhodoLED® lamp series, for PDT (when used together, “Ameluz® PDT”). In the United States, the PDT treatment is used for the lesion-directed and field-directed treatment of actinic keratoses (“AK”) of mild-to-moderate severity on the face and scalp. AKs are premalignant lesions of the skin that can potentially develop into skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) if left untreated.1 International treatment guidelines list photodynamic therapy as the “gold standard” for treating AK, especially multiple AKs and the surrounding photodamaged skin.2 We are currently selling Ameluz® for this indication in the U.S. under an exclusive license and supply agreement (“Ameluz LSA”) between Biofrontera, Inc. and the Ameluz Licensors.
 
AKs are superficial potentially pre-cancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure that may, if left untreated, develop into a form of potentially life-threatening skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. Actinic keratoses typically appear on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, bald scalp, arms or the back of the hands, and are often elevated, flaky, and rough in texture, and appear on the skin as hyperpigmented spots. AKs are typically treated with cryotherapy, topicals, or PDT and these treatments can be used in combination.
 
In general, photodynamic therapy is a two-step process:
 

● | the first step is the application of a drug known as a “photosensitizer,” or a pre-cursor of this type of drug, which tends to accumulate in cancerous cells; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the second step is activation of the photosensitizer by controlled exposure to a selective light source in the presence of oxygen. 

 
During this process, energy from the light activates the photosensitizer. In photodynamic therapy, the activated photosensitizer transfers energy to oxygen molecules found in cells, converting the oxygen into a highly reactive oxygen species (“ROS”), which destroys or alters the sensitized cells. Photodynamic therapy can be a highly selective treatment that targets specific cells while minimizing damage to normal surrounding tissues. It also can allow for multiple courses of therapy. Hence the mode of action of photodynamic therapy requires destruction of the altered cells, temporary local skin reactions and inflammation of the treated area might be expected. The Ameluz® PDT therapy is highly effective with patients experiencing up to 91% clearance after one or two treatments3 with limited or no scaring. The therapy also may provide protection from potentially fatal progress of mild or invisible AKs.4

Market and competitive landscape
 
AK currently affects approximately 58 million Americans which lead to roughly 13 million treatments annually.5 Cryotherapy is the traditional and most common form of treatment but may not be as effective and may leave scarring; cryotherapy is estimated to be approximately 86% of the market. Topicals, medications which patients apply to the lesion multiple times per day for up to several weeks, constitutes approximately 12% of the market. PDT is approximately 2% of the market. The total market size is estimated to be roughly $4 billion for the three therapy types. Our primary competitor in the PDT space is Levulan® and the associated light, Blu-U®.


Our goal is to continue expansion in the current PDT market share and focus on converting cryotherapy treatments of more than 14 lesions as a field therapy such as Ameluz® PDT could be more effective. This targeted market is about 11% or $440 million of the total AK market.6 Ameluz® PDT is competitive in the market. We are leveraging medical affairs, advisory boards, and key opinion leaders in order to educate the market on the use and benefits of Ameluz® PDT.

Sales, marketing and distribution
 
We are currently selling our portfolio of licensed products in the United States through the use of our own commercial organization. We have a single sales force who markets all our licensed products across the dermatology space. We launched the commercialization of Ameluz® in combination with the RhodoLED® lamp for the treatment of actinic keratosis in the United States in October 2016. Ameluz® PDT is an in-office procedure. Ameluz® is distributed as a “buy-and-bill” drug that is purchased by the dermatologist, rather than distribution through pharmacies. Our customers will purchase our device and Ameluz® which will be held in inventory. When a dermatologist uses our product in a treatment, a payor will be billed, and the provider will be paid for both the product and light treatment. There are well established PDT CPT Codes. Ameluz® PDT is covered by code number 96574 which has an average reimbursement of $286.00 per light treatment and has to be performed by a qualified healthcare professional. Public information regarding CPT reimbursement is available at https://www.cms.gov/medicare/physician-fee-schedule/search?Y=0&T=4&HT=0&CT=3&H1=96574&M=5.

Our licensors’ research and development programs
 
We are a sales organization with focus on commercializing our portfolio of licensed products that are already FDA-approved. Research and development efforts for label extensions in order to optimize the market positioning of the products are the responsibility of the respective licensor and are governed by the respective LSAs.
 
Under the Ameluz LSA, we hold the exclusive license to sell Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp series comprising the RhodoLED® and the new, more advanced RhodoLED® XL (when available) in the United States for all indications currently approved by the FDA as well as all future FDA-approved indications identified under the Ameluz LSA.
 
A summary of our understanding of the Licensor’s clinical trials is below:
 

 | | | Clinical Phase | 
--------+--------------------------------------+--------------+--------------------+---
Product | Indication | Pre-clinical | I | II | III | Status 
Ameluz® | Superficial basal cell carcinoma | | | | ● | Clinical Study Report (CSR) expected Q2 – 2024 
Ameluz® | Actinic keratosis | | ● | | | Safety study with 3 tubes of Ameluz®; CSR expected Q3 – 2023 
Ameluz® | Moderate to severe acne | | | ● | | CSR expected Q2 – 2024 
Ameluz® | Actinic keratosis | | | | ● | Trunk & extremities with 1-3 tubes First patient dosed 01/23; CSR expected Q1 - 2025
Ameluz® | Actinic keratosis | | | | ● | Combination daylight + conventional PDT, plan to start enrollment in 2023 
Ameluz® | Squamous cell carcinoma in situ | | | | ● | Plan to start enrollment in 2024 

 
In late October 2021, the new, larger RhodoLED® XL was approved by the FDA in combination with Ameluz® for the treatment of mild and moderate actinic keratoses on the face and scalp, which corresponds to the current approval of Ameluz®. The new PDT-lamp enables the illumination of larger areas, thus allowing the simultaneous treatment of several actinic keratoses distant from each other. The BF-RhodoLED® model will continue to be offered in the U.S. market.
 
Principal suppliers
 
Our source for the Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp series is our Licensor, Biofrontera Pharma. Biofrontera Pharma is considered the responsible manufacturer for Ameluz® by the FDA. Biofrontera Pharma currently manufactures through a single unaffiliated contract manufacturer in Switzerland, Glaropharm AG, and has recently signed an agreement with a second unaffiliated contract manufacturer located in Germany, Pharbil Waltrop GmbH, to ensure stability of the supply chain. Our Licensor is responsible for all raw materials, product, and shipment of products to our third-party logistics partner (“3PL”), Cardinal Health for warehousing and distribution. We centralize our customer sales support and back-office functions through our headquarters in Woburn, Massachusetts.
 
We intend to continue our development of our sales and marketing infrastructure to effectively target the broad range of dermatologic prescribers. To further our development, we plan to expand our headcount, increase our investment in market research and brand development, further develop our distribution capabilities and explore broader payer relationships and coverage.

Xepi®
 
Our second prescription drug licensed product in our portfolio is Xepi® (ozenoxacin cream, 1%), a topical non-fluorinated quinolone that inhibits bacterial growth. Currently, no antibiotic resistance against Xepi® is known and it has been specifically approved by the FDA for the treatment of impetigo, a common skin infection, due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It is approved for use in the United States in adults and children 2 months and older. We are currently selling Xepi® for this indication in the United States under an exclusive license and supply agreement, as amended (“Xepi LSA”), with Ferrer that was assumed by Biofrontera on March 25, 2019 through our acquisition of Cutanea.
 
Impetigo is a common and highly contagious bacterial skin infection caused by bacteria. The bacteria that can cause impetigo include Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. It occurs most frequently in children 2 to 5 years old, but people of any age can be affected and even more than once. Impetigo causes red sores that most often appear on the face, neck, arms, and legs. These sores can turn into blisters that open and form a yellowish crust. Transmission of the disease is by direct contact and poor hygiene can increase the spread. Although impetigo is a year-round disease, it occurs most often during the warm weather months.7
 
Possible complications of impetigo8 can include:
 

● | Worsening or spreading of the infection 
--+------------------------------------------------------------
● | Scarring, which is more common with ecthyma 
● | Impetigo caused by beta-hemolytic strep bacteria can cause:
● | Kidney damage (poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) 
● | Fever, joint, and other problems (rheumatic fever) 

 
Although impetigo rarely leads to serious complications, effective treatment with drugs like Xepi® can shorten how long impetigo lasts.
 
Market and competitive landscape
 
There are more than 3 million cases of impetigo in the United States every year.5 The market for topical antibiotics is driven by generics with mupirocin being the top choice of topical antibiotics across all specialties. In 2021, over 13 million prescriptions were written for mupirocin for a range of conditions. According to prescription data from IQVIA, dermatologists account for approximately 12% of the annual topical antibiotic prescriptions written or about 1.4 million prescriptions. Xepi® is a prescription product that is filled by specialty pharmacies nationwide and orders to these specialty pharmacies are fulfilled by our 3PL, Cardinal Health. Sales to the specialty pharmacies are recognized net of sales deductions, which include expected returns, discounts and incentives such as payments made under patient assistance programs.
 
Our licensors’ research and development programs
 
Currently, there are no clinical trials being conducted for Xepi®, and we are unaware of any immediate or near-term plans of Ferrer for a U.S.-market focused development pipeline.
 
Sales, marketing and distribution
 
We are currently selling our portfolio of licensed products in the United States through the use of our own commercial organization. We have a single sales force who markets all our licensed products across the dermatology space.


Although recent developments with respect to the third-party manufacturer that was providing our supply of Xepi® have impacted the timing of sales expansion and improved market positioning, Ferrer is in the process of qualifying a new third-party manufacturer in North America. The expectation is that this process will be completed by early 2024. Once the new third-party manufacturer is qualified, we expect the supply of Xepi® will meet future needs. Xepi®, is distributed through specialty pharmacies and generally covered by most commercial payers without pre-approval or similar requirements. Our contracts with third-party payers/pharmacy benefit managers (“PBMs”) generally require us to provide rebates based on utilization by the patients they cover. We believe that Xepi® has the potential to be another innovative product with a large market potential.

Intellectual Property
 
We do not own any material patents or trademarks. We license the rights and trademarks related to the products we sell. 
 
Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp series are approved by the FDA as a combination product, such that the label requires the use of both products together. The Licensor has patent protection on its nanoemulsion technology in the United States until 2028  and three new patent family applications on the BF-RhodoLED® lamps and general PDT illumination procedures, two of which are already granted and one is listed in the Orange Book, that could jointly extend protection until 2040.
 
Xepi® is protected by four patents in the United States held by Ferrer. The primary patent protecting the active ingredient in Xepi® expires in November 2023. However, there are treatment specific patents for the treatment of impetigo due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes and a method of treating nasopharynx infections in asymptomatic nasal carriers expiring in 2032 and 2029, respectively.
 
Commercial Partners and Agreements
 
Ameluz® and RhodoLED® Lamp Series License Service Agreement 
 
On June 16, 2021, we entered into the Ameluz LSA with Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience. Under the terms of the Ameluz LSA, we were granted an exclusive, non-transferable license to use Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience technology to use, import, export, distribute, market, offer for sale and sell Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp series for its approved indications within the United States and certain of its territories and agreed to purchase a minimum number of units according to an agreed schedule.
 
On October 8, 2021, we entered into an amendment to the Ameluz LSA under which the price we pay per unit will be based upon our sales history, although the minimum number of units to purchase per year remains unchanged.
 The amendment to the Ameluz LSA that became effective on October 8, 2021, also shifted the costs of clinical development for FDA-approved indications that are not currently being sought by the Ameluz Licensor, as described below.
 
In addition, under the Ameluz LSA, the Ameluz Licensor agrees to sell us the RhodoLED® lamp series at cost plus a low double digit handling fee. There are no milestone or royalty obligations associated with this agreement. Any changes to pricing of supply of Ameluz® or RhodoLED® lamps would require agreement by both contract parties.
 
The Ameluz LSA will remain in effect until June 2036, at which time the Ameluz LSA may automatically renew depending on Biofrontera’s achievement of certain revenue goals. Both parties may terminate the agreement early for a material breach after a 60-day cure period.
 
The Ameluz LSA also provides that we will indemnify the Ameluz Licensor, subject to certain conditions, for any claims related to a breach of our representations and covenants under the agreement or any other gross negligent, willful or intentionally wrongful act, error or omission on our part. Under the terms of the agreement, the Ameluz Licensor will indemnify us, subject to certain conditions, against claims related to the licensed products.

Under the Ameluz LSA, the Ameluz Licensor is responsible for obtaining and maintaining the rights to all FDA approvals (and any required maintenance thereafter) needed for the Ameluz Licensor to manufacture Ameluz® and/or the RhodoLED® lamp series and/or for Biofrontera to sell Ameluz® and/or the RhodoLED® lamp series in the United States. Likewise, the Ameluz Licensor is responsible to maintain a pharmacovigilance database and to respond appropriately to all relevant queries of any regulatory authority pertaining to pharmacovigilance (Biofrontera is required to provide reasonable support relating to any regulatory issues relating to pharmacovigilance and/or product recalls). Furthermore, the Ameluz Licensor will, in agreement with Biofrontera, perform and finance clinical trials to promote the Ameluz® market positioning in the U.S. market for indications that are identified in the amendment signed on October 8, 2021, including the clinical studies. With respect to the indications currently pursued by the Ameluz Licensor, we have the authority under the Ameluz LSA, in certain circumstances, to take over clinical development from the Ameluz Licensor, if they are unable or unwilling to perform these functions appropriately and subtract the cost from the transfer price of future shipments. The pursuit of any additional indications would need to be separately negotiated between us and the Ameluz Licensor.
 
Conversely, under the Ameluz LSA, Biofrontera is responsible for obtaining all state licenses or any other similar approvals required to market Ameluz® and/or the RhodoLED® lamp in the United States. Biofrontera must also carry out all mandatory reporting responsibilities under federal and state law with respect to compliance with the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, the Sunshine Act, or any other similar laws and regulations. Biofrontera is also responsible for all activities related to reimbursement and pricing of the products within the United States. Biofrontera is required by the Ameluz LSA to use commercially reasonable efforts and resources to exploit the license and market Ameluz® and the RhodoLED® lamp in the United States (“commercially reasonable efforts” being defined in terms of comparison against industry standards and practices for a company of comparable size and capability and active in the same business area).
 
Under the Ameluz LSA, if product or lamps are not delivered in conformance with certain specifications of this Agreement and the Quality Assurance Agreement, and the Ameluz Licensor does not remedy its failure, then we will have the right to organize manufacturing on our own, and step into contracts with the Ameluz Licensor’s manufacturers, such that we will replace the Ameluz Licensor as a party to these contracts. If we pursue this option, the Ameluz Licensor must use its best efforts to assist with the transferring of these manufacturing contracts without delay and at its own cost. No transfer price will be paid to the Ameluz Licensor thereafter for products or lamps that are manufactured by third parties.
 
Ferrer Internacional S.A.
 
On March 25, 2019, we assumed the rights, duties and obligations of Cutanea under the Xepi LSA as part of the acquisition of Cutanea. Under the terms of the Xepi LSA, we have been granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in the United States and certain of its territories, including the right to sublicense under certain conditions, to develop, make, have made, use, register, market, promote, sell, have sold, offer for sale and import Xepi®.
 
Under the Xepi LSA, we are obligated to make payments to Ferrer upon the occurrence of certain milestones. Specifically, we must pay Ferrer (i) $2,000,000 upon the first occasion when annual net sales of Xepi® under the Xepi LSA exceed $25,000,000, and (ii) $4,000,000 upon the first occasion annual net sales of Xepi® under the Xepi LSA exceed $50,000,000. The maximum potential milestone payments remaining under this agreement total $6,000,000. These are both sales-based milestones. There are no development milestones within the agreement.
 
The terms of the Xepi LSA also provide for us to purchase Xepi® from Ferrer and pay royalties at a high single digit percentage based on net sales. Royalties are paid quarterly when the related sales occur. There are no other performance obligations required for royalties to be incurred. Furthermore, while Ferrer is approval holder for Xepi®, the administration of the NDA is managed by Biofrontera Bioscience. We are fully dependent on our collaboration with Ferrer for our supply of Xepi® from their sole supplier.
 
The Xepi LSA will continue for the longer of (a) 12 years following the first commercial sale of Xepi® or (b) 12 years from the date of latest product to launch under the Xepi LSA, concluding in 2030. However, the Xepi LSA will automatically terminate concurrently with the termination of Ferrer’s license with Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd., also in 2030. Ferrer covenants under the agreement to make commercially reasonable efforts to extend its license agreement with Toyama. Although recent developments with respect to the third-party manufacturer that was providing our supply of Xepi® have impacted the timing of sales expansion and improved market positioning, we believe that Xepi® has the potential to be another innovative product with a large market potential in our portfolio. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates —Intangible Assets and Impairment Assessment” in this Form 10-K.

Under the Xepi LSA, Biofrontera is required to obtain and maintain all “Marketing Authorizations and Regulatory Approvals” in Ferrer’s name, as well as to obtain and maintain all other licenses and certificates required for the wholesale and/or retail sale of Xepi® in the United States. Biofrontera must also participate in a “Joint Steering Committee,” which is intended, in part, to ensure (among other things) that Biofrontera uses commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell Xepi® in the United States. This joint steering committee is required to meet at least once per year, unless agreed otherwise by the parties.
 
Government and Industry Regulation
 
Governmental authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety surveillance, efficacy, quality control, labeling, packaging, distribution, record keeping, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing, sale, export and import, pricing (including discounts and rebates), and the reporting of safety and other post-market information of the products we distribute. These laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and administrative actions. Enforcement measures may include substantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-compliant activities, criminal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions and could result in harm to our reputation and business. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance.


FDA Regulation for Medical Devices
 
After a device is placed on the market, regardless of its classification or premarket pathway, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:
 

● | establishing establishment registration and device listings with the FDA; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers and certain other parties, to follow stringent design, testing, process control, documentation, corrective action/preventive action, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures, as applicable; 
● | labeling statutes and regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for uncleared or unapproved, or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 
● | clearance or approval of product modifications that could affect (or for 510(k) devices, significantly affect) safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a change (or for 510(k) devices, a major change) in intended use; 
● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if an event reasonably suggests that their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the same or a similar device of the manufacturer were to recur; 
● | corrections and removals reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA, that may present a risk to health. In addition, the FDA may order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; and 
● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including requirements to conduct post-market surveillance studies to establish additional safety or efficacy data. 


10
--


The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. The agency may conduct announced and unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Failure by us or our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions and related consequences including, but not limited to:
 

● | untitled letters or warning letters; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
● | recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
● | refusal of or delay in granting our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products; 
● | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted; 
● | refusal to grant export approval for our products; 
● | criminal prosecution; and 
● | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions. 

 
Our Licensors are subject to announced and unannounced device inspections by FDA and other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable local, state and federal statutes and regulations.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
We are subject to healthcare anti-fraud and abuse regulations that are enforced by the U.S. federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

● | the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Law; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | federal false claims laws; 
● | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
● | the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent; and 
● | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 

 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, or lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, administrative penalties and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.
 

11
--


Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
 
Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. Entities can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers, promoting a product off-label, or for providing medically unnecessary services or items. In addition, activities relating to the sale and marketing of products are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for the federal civil False Claims Act violations may include up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, and, although the federal civil False Claims Act is a civil statute, False Claims Act violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes.
 
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
 
We may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which established uniform standards for certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included sweeping expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards called the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, the new law makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
