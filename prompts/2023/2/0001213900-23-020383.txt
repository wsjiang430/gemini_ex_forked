ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Corporate Overview



Augusta Gold Corp. (“Augusta Gold” or the “Company”) is a gold company that is an exploration stage issuer focused on building a long-term business that delivers stakeholder value through developing the Company’s Bullfrog and Reward gold projects and pursing accretive merger and acquisition opportunities. We are focused on exploration and advancement of gold exploration and potential development projects, which may lead to gold production or strategic transactions such as joint venture arrangements with other mining companies or sales of assets for cash and/or other consideration. At present all our properties are exploration stage properties and we do not mine, produce or sell any mineral products and we do not currently generate cash flows from mining operations.



The Bullfrog Gold Project is located approximately 120 miles north-west of Las Vegas, Nevada and 4 miles west of Beatty, Nevada. The Reward Gold Project is located seven miles from the Bullfrog Gold Project. The Company owns, controls or has acquired mineral rights on federal patented and unpatented mining claims in the State of Nevada for the purpose of exploration and potential development of gold, silver, and other metals. The Company plans to review opportunities and acquire additional mineral properties with current or historic precious and base metal mineralization with meaningful exploration potential. See “Part I - Item 2 - Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the Bullfrog and Reward gold projects.



The Company is led by a management team and board of directors with a proven track record of success in financing, exploring and developing mining assets and delivering shareholder value.



Augusta Gold Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 23, 2007 as Kopr Resources Corp. On July 21, 2011, the Company changed its name to “Bullfrog Gold Corp.” On January 26, 2021, the Company changed its name to “Augusta Gold Corp.” and completed a consolidation of its shares of common stock on the basis of one (1) new share of common stock for every six (6) old shares of common stock (the “Consolidation”).



Recent Development of the Business



On October 9, 2020, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the “MIPA”) among the Company, Homestake Mining Company of California (“Homestake”), and Lac Minerals (USA) LLC (“Lac Minerals” and together with Homestake, the “Barrick Parties”).



Pursuant to the MIPA, the Company agreed to purchase from the Barrick Parties, and the Barrick Parties agreed to sell to the Company, all of the equity interests (the “Equity Interests”) in Bullfrog Mines LLC (“Bullfrog Mines”), the successor by conversion of Barrick Bullfrog Inc. (the “Acquisition Transaction”).



The Acquisition Transaction closed on October 26, 2020. Through the Company’s acquisition of the Equity Interests, the Company acquired rights to 1,500 acres of land adjoining the Company’s Bullfrog Gold deposit. Additional details on the Acquisition Transaction are set out in this Annual Report under “Part I - Item 2 - Properties” – “Bullfrog Gold Project, Nye County, Nevada” - “Location, Property Description and Ownership” - “Barrick Claims”.



Following closing of the Acquisition Transaction, the Company’s board and management was reconstituted to include Maryse Bélanger as President, CEO and director, and Messrs. Donald Taylor and Daniel Earle as directors of the Company joining Mr. David Beling as the sole pre-existing Company director.



On January 7, 2021, the Company announced the appointment of Mr. Richard Warke, Ms. Poonam Puri and Mr. John Boehner as directors of the Company, the resignation of Mr. David Beling as a director of the Company, and the appointments of new members of management. On January 20, 2021, the Company announced the appointment of Mr. Len Boggio as a director of the Company.

On April 13, 2021, the Company announced the appointment of Mr. Donald Taylor as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the resignation of Maryse Belanger as President, Chief Executive Officer and a director.



On June 13, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of the outstanding membership interests (collectively, the “CR Interests”) of CR Reward LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Waterton (“CR Reward”), pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement (the “Reward Agreement”) with Waterton Nevada Splitter, LLC (“Waterton”). CR Reward holds the Reward Project located seven miles from the Company’s Bullfrog Project in Nevada. The CR Interests were acquired for the following consideration: (a) $12,500,000 in cash paid at the closing; plus (b) the issuance of 7,800,000 shares of Augusta Gold common stock at the closing; plus (c) $22,121,398 in cash paid on September 14, 2022.



On September 14, 2022, the Company also announced that it had entered into a loan with a company owned by the Company’s executive chairman for $22,232,561. The loan bears interest at a rate of prime plus 3%, is for a maximum period of 12 months, and is secured by the Company’s Bullfrog and Reward projects.



On January 20, 2023, the Company announced that it had closed a bought deal offering of units of Augusta Gold (the “Units”) for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately C$11.5 million, including the full exercise of the over-allotment option in the amount of C$1.5 million. Pursuant to the Offering, a total of 6,725,147 Units were sold at a price of C$1.71 per Unit. Each Unit was comprised of one share of the Company’s common stock and one-half of one common stock purchase warrant (each whole common stock purchase warrant, a “Warrant”). Each Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one share of the Company’s common stock at a price of C$2.30 until January 20, 2026.



Availability of Raw Materials



All of the raw materials we require to carry on our business are readily available through normal supply or business contracting channels in Canada and the United States. As a result, we do not believe that we will experience any shortages of required personnel, equipment or supplies in the foreseeable future.



Dependence on a Few Contracts



Our business is not substantially dependent on any contract such as a contract to sell the major part of the Company’s products or services or to purchase the major part of its requirements for goods, services or raw materials, or on any franchise or license or other agreement to use a patent, formula, trade secret, process or trade name upon which its business depends. Rather, our ability to continue making the holding, assessment, lease and option payments necessary to maintain our interest in our mineral projects is of primary concern. We do not presently anticipate any difficulties in this regard in the current financial year.



Competition



We compete with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition, exploration, financing and development of gold properties. There is competition among mining companies for a limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities. We may compete with other mining companies for mining claims in regions adjacent to our existing claims. Some of these competing mining companies have substantially greater financial and technical resources than us. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices.



We compete with other mining companies to retain expert consultants required to complete our geological, project development, and analytical and metallurgical studies. We also compete with other mining companies to hire mining engineers, geologists and other skilled personnel in the mining industry, and for exploration and development services. In competing for qualified mineral exploration personnel, we may be required to pay compensation or benefits relatively higher than those paid in the past, and the availability of qualified personnel may be limited in high-demand commodity cycles.



We will be subject to competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry in the event spot shortages for certain equipment such as bulldozers and excavators and services, such as contract drilling that we will need to conduct exploration. There is also significant competition for power in Beatty, Nevada. If we are unsuccessful in securing the products, equipment, services and power we need, we may have to suspend our exploration plans until we are able to secure them.

Compliance with Government Regulation



The exploration and development of a mining property is subject to regulation by a number of federal and state government authorities. These include the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the United States Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) as well as the various state environmental protection agencies. The regulations address many environmental issues relating to air, soil and water contamination and apply to many mining related activities including exploration, mine construction, mineral extraction, ore milling, water use, waste disposal and use of toxic substances. In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to labor standards, occupational health and safety, mine safety, general land use, export of minerals and taxation. Many of the regulations require permits or licenses to be obtained and the filing of Notices of Intent and Plans of Operations, the absence of which or inability to obtain will adversely affect the ability for us to conduct our exploration, development and operation activities. The failure to comply with the regulations and terms of permits and licenses may result in fines or other penalties or in revocation of a permit or license or loss of a prospect.
Federal



On lands owned by the United States, mining rights are governed by the General Mining Law of 1872, as amended, which allows the location of mining claims on certain federal lands upon the discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and compliance with location requirements. The exploration of mining properties and development and operation of mines is governed by both federal and state laws. Federal laws that govern mining claim location and maintenance and mining operations on federal lands are generally administered by the BLM. Additional federal laws, governing mine safety and health, also apply. State laws also require various permits and approvals before exploration, development or production operations can begin. Among other things, a reclamation plan must typically be prepared and approved, with bonding in the amount of projected reclamation costs. The bond is used to ensure that proper reclamation takes place, and the bond will not be released until that time. Local jurisdictions may also impose permitting requirements (such as conditional use permits or zoning approvals).
Nevada



In Nevada, initial stage surface exploration activities that do not disturb the surface, do not require any permits. Notice-level exploration permits (“NOI”) are required (through the BLM) for the Bullfrog Gold Project to perform drilling or other surface disturbing activities with less than five acres extent. More extensive disturbance requires submittal and approval of a “Plan of Operations” and “Environmental Assessment” from the BLM.



In Nevada, we are also required to post bonds with the State of Nevada to secure our environmental and reclamation obligations on private land, with amount of such bonds reflecting the level of rehabilitation anticipated by the then proposed activities.



If in the future we are successful in defining a commercially viable mineral deposit on our property interests, then if and when we commence any mineral production, we will also need to comply with laws that regulate or propose to regulate our mining activities, including the management and handling of raw materials, disposal, storage and management of hazardous and solid waste, the safety of our employees and post-mining land reclamation.



We cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws, regulations or permitting requirements, or changes in the ways that such laws, regulations or permitting requirements are enforced, interpreted or administered. Health, safety and environmental laws and regulations are complex, are subject to change and have become more stringent over time. It is possible that greater than anticipated health, safety and environmental capital expenditures or reclamation and closure expenditures will be required in the future. We expect continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future investments for environmental controls at our operations.



Environmental Regulation



Our mineral projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. The development, operation, closure, and reclamation of mining projects in the United States requires numerous notifications, permits, authorizations, and public agency decisions. Compliance with environmental and related laws and regulations requires us to obtain permits issued by regulatory agencies, and to file various reports and keep records of our operations. Certain of these permits require periodic renewal or review of their conditions and may be subject to a public review process during which opposition to our proposed operations may be encountered. We are currently operating under various permits for activities connected to mineral exploration, reclamation, and environmental considerations. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations.



Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.

U.S. Federal Laws



The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes, impose strict, joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites. It is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions, demands for reimbursement for government-incurred cleanup costs, or natural resource damages, or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance, as well as requirements for corrective actions. CERCLA, RCRA and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean-up of sites and disposal of substances found on exploration, mining and processing sites long after activities on such sites have been completed.



The Clean Air Act (“CAA”), as amended, restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including exploration, development, mining and processing activities. The Company’s current exploration activities and any future development, mining or processing operations by the Company may produce air emissions, including fugitive dust and other air pollutants from stationary equipment, storage facilities and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment, which are subject to review, monitoring and/or control requirements under the CAA and state air quality laws. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before development, mining and processing work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. In addition, permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or result in additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules.



The National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) requires federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision-making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions, including issuance of permits to mining facilities, and assessing alternatives to those actions. If a proposed action could significantly affect the environment, the agency must prepare a detailed statement known as an Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”). The EPA, other federal agencies, and any interested third parties will review and comment on the scoping of the EIS and the adequacy of and findings set forth in the draft and final EIS. This process can cause delays in issuance of required permits or result in changes to a project to mitigate its potential environmental impacts, which can in turn impact the economic feasibility of a proposed project.



The Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and comparable state statutes, impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA regulates storm water at mining facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities. Such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run-off from its operations. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The CWA and comparable state statutes provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release.



The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program promulgated thereunder, regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state. The program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal or injection well. Violation of these regulations and/or contamination of groundwater by exploration, development, mining, processing or other related activities may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SWDA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.



Nevada



Other Nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations. Any changes to these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations by, for example, requiring changes to operating constraints, technical criteria, fees or surety requirements.
Employees



As of the date of this filing, the Company has 12 employees (including shared employees). We continue to engage various independent contractors and consultants to fulfill additional needs. Additional employees will be hired on an as needed basis.

Gold Price History



The price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global gold demand and political and economic conditions.



The following table presents the high, low and average afternoon fixed prices in U.S. dollars for an ounce of gold on the London Bullion Market over the past five years:




Year | High | | Low | | Average
-----+------+-------+-----+-------+--------
2018 | | 1,355 | | 1,178 | | 1,269
