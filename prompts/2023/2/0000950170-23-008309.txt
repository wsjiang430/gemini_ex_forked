Overview
 
We are a leading, diversified home care platform focused on providing care to medically complex, high-cost patient populations. We directly address the most pressing challenges facing the U.S. healthcare system by providing safe, high-quality care in the home, a lower cost care setting preferred by patients. Our patient-centered care delivery platform is designed to improve the quality of care our patients receive, which allows them to remain in their homes and minimizes the overutilization of high-cost care settings such as hospitals or skilled nursing facilities. Our clinical model is led by our caregivers, who provide a range of specialized clinical care and non-clinical services to address the complex needs of each patient we serve across the full range of patient populations: newborns, children, adults and seniors. We have invested significantly in our platform to bring together best-in-class talent at all levels of the organization and support such talent with industry leading training, clinical programs, infrastructure and technology-enabled systems, which are increasingly essential in an evolving healthcare industry. We believe our platform creates sustainable competitive advantages that support our ability to continue driving rapid growth, both organically and through acquisitions, and positions us as the partner of choice for the patients we serve.
Service Offerings
 
We provide a broad range of home care services. We seek to meet a full range of care needs for patients while minimizing the complexity and potential disruption to patient care associated with procuring multiple types of care from a number of independent providers. We believe this positions us as the provider of choice for patients, families, referral sources and payers.
 
Aveanna provides its services through three segments: Private Duty Services (“PDS”); Home Health & Hospice (“HHH”); and Medical Solutions (“MS”). This presentation aligns our financial reporting with the manner in which we manage our business operations, with a focus on the strategic allocation of resources and separate branding strategies between the business divisions.
 
Private Duty Services
 
Private Duty Services predominantly includes private duty nursing (“PDN”) services, as well as pediatric therapy services. Our PDN patients typically enter our service as children, as our most significant referral sources for new patients are children’s hospitals. It is common for our PDN patients to continue to receive our services into adulthood, as approximately 30% of our PDN patients are over the age of 18.
Private Duty Nursing
 
We are one of the largest providers of PDN services in the United States. We provide a range of services for medically complex children and young adults with a wide variety of serious illnesses and conditions, including chronic respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy and/or mechanical ventilation, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, congenital anomalies, failure to thrive and anoxic brain injuries. Our caregivers, a majority of whom are registered nurses and licensed practical nurses, monitor an individual’s condition, administer

medications and treatment regimens, provide enteral and other forms of tube feeding, monitor and maintain ventilators, administer pain management treatments and coordinate other forms of medical care. The length of service for a patient under our care can be three or more years until the patient graduates from the need for a feeding tube, ventilator or tracheostomy. This affords us the distinct ability to improve outcomes and control costs. However, many of our highest acuity patients remain on our services for ten or more years. Our PDN services typically last four to 24 hours a day. Our services are provided by our nursing staff up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with multiple nurses dedicated to our highest need patients.
 
Our services typically commence upon a patient’s discharge from the newborn intensive care unit or pediatric intensive care unit. While we focus primarily on pediatric PDN services, we continue to provide PDN services to our patients as they mature into adulthood. The majority of adult PDN patients have aged out of eligibility for pediatric PDN through Medicaid and are eligible for Medicaid waiver programs to continue to receive PDN services.
 
Pediatric Therapy
 
We provide physical, occupational and speech therapy services to assist pediatric patients in healing and achieving their highest level of functionality. Our therapy patients include those with developmental delays resulting from neurological, orthopedic, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal conditions. These services can be delivered at home or in a clinic setting. Typical conditions treated include feeding/swallowing disorders, bone/joint disorders and eye/hand coordination impairment. Similar to our enteral services, many of our PDN patients also require in-home therapy and we are able to deliver differentiated levels of service and efficiency as a “one stop shop provider.”
 
Non-Clinical Services
 
We administer payer authorized respite care (a form of non-medical personal care) and related services primarily to patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities or special needs. In the non-clinical business, the family primarily recruits and supervises the care provider. We oversee the administration of payroll taxes, provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation training and/or first aid certification and U.S. Department of Justice clearance for the care provider. Our non-clinical business has had highly stable reimbursement historically allowing for durable, profitable growth. While our non-medical caregivers generally earn at or above the minimum wage, this has not historically been a source of risk to our margins, as our non-clinical reimbursement rates generally have mechanisms to adjust commensurate with state and local changes in applicable minimum wages.
 
Home Health & Hospice
 
We provide home health, hospice and specialty program services to predominately elderly populations seeking compassionate care and assistance with activities of daily living in the home. Our home health services help our patients recover from surgery or illness, live with chronic diseases and prevent avoidable hospital readmissions. We assist patients and their families in understanding their medical conditions, how to manage these conditions and how to maximize the quality of their lives while living with a chronic disease or other health condition. We believe our adult home health services improve the quality of life of our patients, save costs for the healthcare system and result in better clinical outcomes, including low re-hospitalization rates, when compared to institutional settings of care.
 
Our Medicare-certified hospice services are designed to provide comfort and support for those who are dealing with a terminal illness. We provide a full range of hospice services designed to meet the individual physical, spiritual, and psychosocial needs of terminally ill patients and their families. Individuals with a terminal illness such as heart disease, pulmonary disease, Alzheimer’s or cancer may be eligible for hospice care if they have a life expectancy of six months or less. Our hospice services are primarily provided in the patient’s home, and are also provided in skilled nursing facilities and inpatient hospice units where clinically appropriate. The key services provided through our hospice agencies include pain and symptom management accompanied by palliative medication, emotional and spiritual support, inpatient and respite care, homemaker services and dietary counseling. We also provide personal care services which include non-medical assistance with activities of daily living and can help seniors avoid costlier downstream medical costs and hospitalizations.
 
Medical Solutions
 
We provide needed supplies to patients requiring enteral nutrition services or respiratory care. Enteral nutrition, also known as tube or intravenous (“IV”) feeding, is a way of delivering nutrition directly to the stomach or small intestine on an as-needed basis. Many of our PDN patients also require enteral nutrition. Our ability to serve as a single source provider to our patients, families and referral sources provides added cost savings and convenience relative to sourcing from multiple providers.


The MS business serves patients who have short or long-term disabilities and require a supply of infant, pediatric and adult formulas. We provide a wide selection of supplies, such as feeding pumps, g-tubes, feeding bags, syringes, IV poles, ventilators, oxygen and pulse oximeters. Our distribution model provides a streamlined, single-provider experience, enabling patients to seamlessly access one of the largest selections of enteral formulas, supplies and pumps in the industry. In addition to providing the required supplies for enteral therapy, Aveanna offers same day (24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year) patient and caregiver education both in-hospital and at-home, by a registered nurse, registered dietitian or customer service technician.

Our Value Proposition
 
We believe our platform helps solve several of the most pressing challenges in healthcare today. We have designed our platform to deliver lower cost, high-quality care on a national scale to a medically complex, and often costly, patient base in the comfort of their own homes. We believe that our platform delivers a compelling value proposition to our key stakeholders.
Patients and Families
 •We deliver a patient-centered, personalized healthcare experience in the home where patients generally prefer to be.
 •Our robust recruiting infrastructure enables us to match patients and their families with the right nurses more quickly, avoiding unnecessary discharge delays from the hospital.
 •We enable families to continue working rather than foregoing employment to care for loved ones.
 •We provide a “one stop shop” range of clinical services to alleviate cost and administrative burden.
 
Nurses
 •We offer nurses a breadth of caseloads from which to choose that better meet their objectives.
 •Our technology-enabled tools simplify case selection, shift management and point of care medical documentation.
 •We believe our brand, training, benefits and career advancement programs are highly regarded.
 
Provider Partners
 •We help hospitals and health systems quickly discharge some of their most sensitive, medically complex patients to their homes, with highly skilled and trained nurses.
 •We provide consistently high quality of care and compliance standards.
 •We build long-term, trusted relationships with our provider partners.
 
Payers
 •We are a trusted frontline caregiver with close relationships with our payer partners, giving Aveanna the ability to deliver faster discharges into the home or allow patients to remain in the home as opposed to an acute care setting.
 •We offer efficiency as a single-source contracting solution across a wide range of services and markets.
 •We are well-positioned to engage in value-based care models to align interests and save costs for payers.
 
Our Platform
 
We believe the platform we have built is truly differentiated in our ability to serve our stakeholders and grow rapidly in a range of home care end markets. Key elements of our platform include:
Our Team
 
Our team is the driving force that has enabled us to build an industry leading home care platform. People at all levels on our team have worked together over several decades and bring a wealth of experience in home health at industry leading companies. The passion our team brings for delivering exceptional, patient-centered care supports our ability to attract, recruit and retain strong, operationally minded national and regional operators who are essential to executing on our local market strategy. In turn, we are better able to recruit and train passionate frontline caregivers to provide exceptional care to our patients. We believe the team we have built is the most essential element of our platform.
Our Culture
 

Our culture is the glue that binds our organization together. We have purposefully built a culture that attracts like-minded people who are aligned with our mission to change the way home care is delivered, one patient at a time. It is easy to overlook “culture” on paper – however, we fundamentally believe it drives our success and we take active steps to promote our culture. From day one at Aveanna, we welcome new hires into our culture with training centered around our Core Values to deliver care with compassion, work with team integrity, strive for inclusion, embody trust, seek innovation and have fun. Compliance is the backdrop that underscores everything we do. These principles inform our fundamental operating processes, including everything from strategic planning, budgeting, go-to-market strategy and employee compensation and promotion. We believe our culture supports our ability to recruit, motivate and empower our people at all levels to deliver better patient care and drive our operating performance.
Our Systems, Processes and Technology
 
We have a corporate infrastructure with robust systems and processes in place designed to drive efficiency and support our future growth. We have invested significantly in our infrastructure and technology. Our frontline caregivers leverage our technology-enabled solutions, such as our tablet-based care management tools that we deploy into patient homes to enhance data collection and the efficiency and quality of the caregiver experience, and our automated tools for patient scheduling, which seek to ensure appropriately trained nurses are scheduled for our most clinically complex patients. Our technology infrastructure includes cloud-based solutions that enable essential functions of our business to run more efficiently, including, from front to back: (i) Internet Collaborative Information Management Systems ("iCIMS") for sourcing, recruiting and onboarding; (ii) CellTrak EVV technology, as well as internally developed Aveanna Hope Devices with mobile connectivity installed in patient homes to capture care reporting; (iii) Netsmart myUnity, Homecare Homebase, and Brightree Cloud electronic medical records workflows for managing our specialized PDN, adult home health, and MS clinical workflows, respectively, (iv) GLS, Homecare Homebase and Brightree for revenue cycle management, and (v) Workday for core enterprise resource planning workflows around financial management, payroll and HR.
Our Acquisition Team and Integration Management Office (IMO)
 
We have a proven team of six people dedicated to sourcing, evaluating and executing on all aspects of our merger and acquisition strategy, as well as transformational initiatives. Our IMO team has extensive integration experience, with both private duty services and home health businesses, as well as deep functional experience in operations, consulting, finance, IT and administrative roles. We complement our internal team with a core group of third-party advisors with whom we have worked for decades. The experience and discipline the collective team brings to our acquisition strategy enables us to pursue and integrate multiple acquisitions simultaneously without disruption to our business or that of a target. We believe this is a truly differentiated capability relative to our home health peers.
 
Part of the success of our merger and acquisition strategy is attributable to our proven playbook for bringing acquisitions and merger partners onto our platform infrastructure, identifying and quickly capturing significant synergies to the overall enterprise and minimizing the risk of disruption to our underlying business. Our IMO is a key differentiator in this respect. Our IMO team consists of functional experts exclusively dedicated not only to integrating acquisitions quickly and efficiently, as well as overseeing transformational initiatives, such as systems conversions and implementations, material cost reduction and restructuring projects, among other things. Importantly, the IMO team begins developing a tailored integration plan for each acquisition we make early in the merger and acquisition process, in parallel with our due diligence and prior to signing. This enables the IMO to launch an integration plan expeditiously once an acquisition is signed and maintain that momentum through and after closing. The IMO team coordinates seamlessly with our executive leadership through a steering committee-led governance structure that provides strategic direction and oversight for each acquisition. Our IMO team oversees the integration of essential functional areas, including clinical operations, IT, revenue cycle, human resources, compliance and finance, in partnership with our business teams. The team leverages technology to develop and measure progress against each integration plan. Significant emphasis is placed on clear, early and ongoing communication and rolling out the Aveanna culture to our newly acquired companies.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
Technology-Enabled Operating Platform and Corporate Infrastructure
 
The Aveanna platform was purpose-built to deliver high-quality clinical care efficiently. We have made significant investments in our technology and corporate infrastructure to build a scalable care delivery platform. Our technology platform includes multiple cloud applications for managing our business which enable and automate all of our mission critical business functions including caregiver recruiting, staffing, electronic health data capture, financial management, payroll, human resources management and billing and logistics. Our Aveanna Hope Devices and point-of-care technology that we have deployed to our frontline caregivers on tablets and mobile devices significantly improves caregiver efficiency and data collection. We believe our platform is a significant competitive

advantage in the marketplace, driving superior operating performance and margins that enable us to reinvest in growth. We have made these investments in anticipation of the eventual move to value-based care and are well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity.
 
Built to Scale Nationally across Private Duty Services, Adult Home Health and Hospice
 
Over the past five years, we believe we have built one of the largest private duty services businesses in the United States via acquisitions and organic growth. Over this period of time, we also built the corporate infrastructure and processes to expand seamlessly into adult home health and hospice. We have proven our ability to execute our model in multiple geographies with various payers across all three verticals. We have created a repeatable, data-driven playbook to expand our presence across the United States and made substantial investments to support each key component of our approach.
Acquirer of Choice with Proven Ability to Integrate Acquisitions and Realize Synergies
 
Our scaled, national platform in otherwise highly fragmented markets positions us as a clear acquirer of choice for smaller providers seeking to partner with a leading platform. Since our Formation, we have completed and integrated sixteen acquisitions. Our IMO team has developed a proven playbook over long merger and acquisition careers to lead the quick and synergistic integration of our acquisitions. We derive synergies from a host of areas including staffing optimization, technology integration, cross-selling, reduction of overhead, rationalizing overlapping markets and other operational efficiencies that are supported by the differentiated investments we have made in our platform.
Scale Advantages Result in a Network Effect, Accelerating Growth
 
Our scale enables a virtuous cycle of network effects and competitive advantages to our business. First, our local market density creates a network effect where more nurses and higher quality of care translate into the ability to staff cases quickly and find the right match, which in turn, drives more referrals and higher branch profit. This creates a virtuous cycle of scale advantage where higher volumes for Aveanna enable more platform reinvestment, more capital for acquisitions and de novo expansions, and greater payer and referral preference, further driving volumes. These platform investments in turn allow us to develop and maintain advantaged capabilities, technology and infrastructure that create more value for our customers and reinforce our advantages vs. competitors. In particular, we believe that (1) our larger nursing panel and one stop shop service offering translate into higher referent satisfaction levels, higher win rates and more case volumes, (2) our advantaged nurse recruiting, training and staffing capability translate into higher case fill rates and a higher quality of care, (3) our large and sophisticated sales team translates into higher rates of referent penetration in local hospitals, (4) our robust experience with managing payer relations gives us the ability to have conversations with our Managed Care partners to create value-based care arrangements, (5) our stronger set of regional management leaders translates into better execution, and (6) our investments in technology drive efficiency and quality. These scale advantages reinforce our local market share and competitive advantage at every step.
Our Growth Strategy
 
Increase Volumes within Our Existing Footprint
 
We expect to continue to gain share in our existing local markets through our “virtuous cycle” strategy, leveraging our highly regarded brand, service breadth, nurse recruiting and go-to-market capabilities to win a higher share of cases each year, expand our number of referral sources and grow our payer partnerships to deliver value in our services. A core component of this growth strategy is educating referral sources about the differentiated benefits and high-quality outcomes of our services, which result in a higher fill rate and lower rate of readmissions versus competitors. We believe we can further accelerate our growth through new workforce recruiting and training initiatives that will expand our capacity to grow and through de novo branch growth initiatives to grow our geographic coverage within existing markets. In addition, we intend to gain market share through investments in strong local branch leaders and technology infrastructure to enable digital and remote workforce training and onboarding.
Further Expand Into Adult Home Health and Hospice Care
 
We intend to further enhance our position as an end-to-end platform for private duty services and adult home health and hospice services through continued organic and inorganic expansion into the adult home health market. Our management estimates that the adult home health and hospice markets represent a $74 billion market opportunity that remains highly fragmented, with the largest participants only generating low single digit market shares. Against this industry backdrop, we intend to grow in two ways. First, we aim to acquire regional leadership positions through a mix of scale and tuck-in acquisitions, leveraging an attractive and in-place pipeline. Second, we

expect to launch a number of de novo adult home health and hospice branches around newly acquired branches as well as our existing home care footprint, leveraging our platform across 33 states and the 129 Medicare licenses we already have in existing PDN, home health, and hospice locations. In some instances, we have the option to utilize these licenses to open up a new Medicare home health branch or stand up Medicare home health services out of an existing PDN branch which provides a further opportunity for growth.
 
Expand Private Duty Services Presence Through Acquisitions and De Novo Expansions
 
We are the logical consolidator in a highly fragmented private duty services industry given our strong market position, leading brand, capitalization and integration capabilities. We maintain discipline in our approach to valuation and have consistently realized our deal-related growth and operational objectives. We have historically targeted two types of acquisitions: tuck-in and expansion. Our tuck-in acquisitions are smaller in scale, highly synergistic and are meant to drive further density in existing markets, with integration time generally measured in weeks. Our expansion targets are larger in scale and are meant to diversify our geographic footprint while gaining immediate scale and density in new markets, with integration time of one to two months. In our existing and new markets, we can augment our growth by opening up new agencies to further drive local market density and relevance to all constituents.
Cross-Sell Enteral Services to Our PDN and Home Care Patient Base
 
We believe that Aveanna’s unique ability to bundle PDN and enteral nutrition services to our patients is both a significant differentiator for our customers as well as a future growth opportunity. In particular, we believe that the bundling of these services provides families with not only a more convenient “one stop shop” but also a more responsive, tailored service experience due to the ability of Aveanna nurses to manage patients’ enteral shipments from the home. Today, we believe the majority of our PDN patients also receive enteral therapy, but the vast majority of these patients are served by other third-party enteral services providers, creating significant future cross-selling upside for our enteral business to continue to penetrate our PDN patient base.
Reinvest in Our Platform to Optimize Performance
 
We believe ongoing investment in our platform drives greater efficiency across our business, generating a virtuous cycle that allows us to continue growing. We plan to continually invest in improving our people, technology and processes to further drive volumes, leverage our corporate infrastructure and drive higher margins over time.
 
Leverage Our Scale and Capabilities to Drive Value-Based Care Arrangements in Partnership with our MCO Payer Partners
 
We believe that value-based care is the future of home health and have worked to equip ourselves to lead the transition. We believe that Aveanna is uniquely well-positioned to benefit from a shift towards value-based care by virtue of our scale. This allows us to care for a meaningful share of our payer partners’ eligible population, and the substantial investments we have made in our clinical training program, compliance protocols and technology infrastructure, which allow us to provide consistently high-quality care along with patient data and reporting directly from the home. We therefore see Aveanna as a natural “partner of choice” for payers as the industry moves towards value-based care arrangements. We see this transition as a way to improve our future revenue and profitability as we provide value to our partners and we share in savings we can generate for the healthcare system over the long term while also delivering improved patient outcomes.
 
Our Reimbursement Sources
 
We have a highly diverse range of payers that reimburse us. Our payer diversity is due to both our geographic diversity as well as the variety of services we provide, many of which are reimbursed by different payers and have different payment models. Our reimbursement sources are comprised of more than 1,750 distinct payers that include Medicaid managed care organizations (“MCOs”), state-based Medicaid programs, Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans, commercial insurance plans and other governmental payers across 33 states. Each contract we have with our payers is unique and specific to that payer, creating additional diversification benefits.
 
The majority of the Company’s PDN patients are covered by either Medicaid fee-for service (“FFS”) or Medicaid MCOs. State legislatures or responsible state agencies determine Medicaid FFS reimbursement rates for PDN services. In states where traditional FFS Medicaid is the primary payer source for PDN services, there is no rate negotiation; providers simply must accept the rate offered by the state Medicaid system or choose not to accept Medicaid patients and/or be reimbursed by the state Medicaid system. In states that outsource some or all of the Medicaid administration to managed care, MCOs receive a per-member-per-month capitation payment from the state, and then contract for reimbursement rates with each provider of services within the state. Contracts between MCOs and PDN providers generally express reimbursement rates as a percentage of the state’s FFS rate and those rates are negotiated between the

MCO and the provider, with the rates largely based on state guidance and typically within a range of the applicable Medicaid rate. The Company views contract negotiations – including rates, billing, and collections – holistically. When determining whether to enter into or continue a contract with an MCO or commercial payer, the Company considers whether the rate and other contract terms offered are generally acceptable based on commercial billing and collection practices and also allow the Company to appropriately attract and retain caregivers at a market rate. Though the reimbursement rate is important, other contract terms are also important to the Company, including timeliness of payment by the payer, the appeals process for challenging denied claims, and the claims format and submission process. These “non-rate” terms are typically equally as important to the Company as the base reimbursement rate.
 
Changes to our reimbursement tend to mirror wage inflation, supporting historically stable gross margins. The majority of our caregivers earn well above minimum wage and are not impacted by minimum wage increases.

Private Duty Services Reimbursement
 
The primary payers for the private duty services we deliver are state-based Medicaid programs and MCOs. Although traditional Medicaid eligibility is often determined by income or assets, private duty services patients typically qualify for Medicaid regardless of their family’s income because of their medical conditions. A federal law established in 1967, a component of which covers Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (“EPSDT”), requires that state Medicaid programs and Medicaid MCOs cover medically necessary services for children under 21. Many of the private duty services we provide, including PDN, personal care services and physical, occupational and speech therapy, are all explicitly included under the EPSDT benefit. In addition to the federal mandate for coverage of these services, we believe our reimbursement is significantly more stable than other government reimbursed services because private duty nursing patients (many of whom are children with complex medical diagnosis) represent a medically fragile population supported by strong, active advocacy groups, and therefore funding for our services typically receives broad bi-partisan support in state legislatures and Congress. Moreover, state spending on private duty nursing is a small portion of total state Medicaid expenditures, and the home is widely recognized by payers as the lower cost alternative to inpatient care settings. As a result, funding for our services is unlikely to be targeted as a source of savings for states seeking to alleviate budget pressure.
 
Medicaid policy is determined at a state level across each of the states in which we offer these services, providing stability as compared to Medicare reimbursement, which is determined at the federal level. Each state also has the ability to determine whether to administer benefits through a statewide fee-for-service program or through MCOs as noted above, which provide the Company additional payer diversity. The trend across many states has been to slowly transition children with complex medical conditions from traditional FFS to MCOs for many of the private duty services that we provide. Today, the majority of states in which we provide PDS have already transitioned to MCOs. Changes in utilization and reimbursement from the shift to managed care have historically been minimal, with reimbursement for MCO and state Medicaid programs largely at parity. Furthermore, we believe that there is an opportunity for us to capture additional volume from the shift to managed care as MCOs prefer to partner with scale providers like Aveanna who deliver a broad range of services with consistently high-quality care and can demonstrate appropriate cost savings for MCOs by avoiding unplanned hospitalizations.
 
Commercial insurance payers also comprise a small portion of our reimbursement for private duty services. However, commercial benefits coverage is typically limited by monetary spend or visit utilization caps, and when services are no longer covered (or are minimally covered), patients often are able to access services through Medicaid.
 
In our non-clinical business, a significant percentage of our caregivers earn at or near minimum wage. However, this has not historically been a source of risk to our margins, as our reimbursement rates generally have mechanisms that adjust commensurate with local or state changes in applicable minimum wage requirements.

Adult Home Health & Hospice Reimbursement
 
Our adult home health and hospice services are primarily reimbursed by Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans. The Medicare home health benefit is available to patients who need care following discharge from a hospital, as well as patients who suffer from chronic conditions that require intermittent skilled care. While the services received do not need to be rehabilitative or of a finite duration, patients must have a skilled need and meet the definition of homebound as set by CMS. Patients who require full-time skilled nursing for an extended period of time generally do not qualify for Medicare home health benefits. As a condition of coverage under Medicare, beneficiaries must: (1) be homebound, meaning they are unable to leave their home without a considerable and taxing effort; (2) require intermittent skilled nursing, physical therapy or speech therapy services that are covered by Medicare; and (3) receive treatment under a plan of care that is established and periodically reviewed by a physician. Qualifying patients also may receive reimbursement for

occupational therapy, medical social services, and home health aide services if these additional services are part of a plan of care prescribed by a physician.
 
We submit all home health Medicare claims through Medicare Administrative Contractors for the federal government. Medicare Administrative Contractors are private health care insurers that have been awarded a geographic jurisdiction to process Medicare Part A and Part B (A/B) medical claims or durable medical equipment claims for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries.

Final payments may reflect base payment adjustments for case-mix and geographic wage differences and 2% sequestration reduction for episodes that began after March 31, 2013. In addition, final adjustments may reflect one of four retroactive adjustments to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the total reimbursement: (a) an outlier payment if the patient’s care was unusually costly; (b) a low utilization adjustment if the number of visits was fewer than a threshold required to justify a full episodic payment; (c) a partial payment if the patient transferred to another provider or transferred from another provider before completing the episode; or (d) a Notice of Admission ("NOA") penalty if Medicare was not notified of a patient admission within five days of the start of care. Because such adjustments are determined upon the completion date of the episode, retroactive adjustments could impact our financial results. The base payment rate for Medicare home nursing was $2,031.64 per 30-day episode for the year ended December 31, 2022. The base payment rate does not take into consideration the 2% sequestration payment reduction mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011.
 
Home health payment rates are updated annually by the home health market basket percentage as adjusted by Congress. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) establishes the home health market basket index, which measures inflation in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in home health services.
 
The Medicare hospice benefit covers a broad set of palliative services for beneficiaries who have a life expectancy of six months or less, as determined by their physicians. Medicare pays hospices a daily rate for each day a beneficiary is enrolled in the hospice benefit. Each day of hospice benefit, a level of care is assigned based on one of four case types: routine home care, continuous home care, inpatient respite care and general inpatient care. For Medicare’s 2022 fiscal year, the base per diem hospice payment rate for each service were: $203.40 for each of the first 60 days of routine home care and $160.74 for every day thereafter; $1,462.52 for continuous home care; $473.75 for inpatient respite care; and $1,068.28 for general inpatient care. These payments are reduced by 2% for hospices that do not report specified quality data to CMS.
 
Competition
 
Competitive Position
 
Private Duty Services (PDS)
 
The PDS services industry in which Aveanna operates is highly competitive and fragmented. PDS providers range from facility-based agencies, such as day health centers, live in facilities and government agencies, to independent homecare companies. Our PDS competitors may be not-for-profit organizations or for-profit organizations. There are relatively few barriers to entry in some of the home health services markets in which Aveanna operates. In addition to several multistate privately held companies, Aveanna’s primary competitors for its home health business are hospital-based home health agencies and local home health agencies, both for profit and not-for-profit. Aveanna competes with other home health providers on the basis of availability of caregivers, quality and expertise of services and the value of services. Aveanna believes that it has a favorable competitive position, attributable mainly to the consistently high quality and targeted services it has historically provided to its patients, as well as to its screening and evaluation procedures and training programs for clinical associates who provide direct care to patients.
 
Additionally, Aveanna’s competitors will likely strive to improve their service offerings and drive growth in non-government reimbursed programs. Aveanna also expects its competitors to develop new strategic relationships with providers, referral sources and payers, which could result in increased competition.
 
Medical Solutions (MS)
 
The medical solutions industry in which Aveanna operates is highly competitive, fragmented and market specific. Each local market has its own competitive blue print, and there are few competitors with significant market share in all of the markets in which Aveanna operates. Aveanna competes with providers, privately and publicly held organizations, and not-for-profit organizations. There is continual competition from new entrants into Aveanna’s markets.
 

Aveanna’s Medicare MS business line could be impacted by the future Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (“DMEPOS”) competitive bid award. The DMEPOS program provides Medicare reimbursement to suppliers of medical items, including, among such other things, enteral nutrition products and oxygen, for Medicare beneficiaries. The DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program was mandated by Congress through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. The statute requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for selected DMEPOS items with a competitive bid process. Under the program, a competition among suppliers who operate in a particular competitive bidding area (“CBA”) is conducted. Suppliers are required to submit a bid for selected products. On March 7, 2019, CMS announced plans to consolidate the CBAs included in the Round 2 Recompete and Round 1 2017 DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program into a single round of competition named Round 2021. Round 2021 contracts became effective on January 1, 2021, and extend through December 31, 2023. The list of supplies included in Round 2021 includes, among other items, MS products such as enteral nutrition products and oxygen. On April 10, 2020, CMS announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it removed the non-invasive ventilators product category from the Round 2021 DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced that it would not award competitive bid contracts in 13 of the 15 remaining product categories due to a failure to achieve expected savings, and that Round 2021 contract awards would only be made for off-the-shelf (OTS) knee and back braces. Revenue derived from OTS knee and back braces, if any, is immaterial to Aveanna. While Aveanna cannot predict the outcome of the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program on its MS business in the future, nor the Medicare payment rates that will be in effect in future years for the items subjected to competitive bidding, the program may materially adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.
 
Home Health and Hospice Services (HHH)
 
The home health market is highly competitive and fragmented. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (“MedPac”), an independent agency that advises Congress on various Medicare issues, there were approximately 11,456 Medicare-certified home health agencies in the United States in 2020. Generally, competition in home health service and hospice markets comes from local and regional providers. These providers include facility- and hospital-based providers, visiting nurse associations and nurse registries. Aveanna competes based on the availability of personnel, the quality of services, expertise of visiting staff, and, in certain instances, the price of our services.
 
Source and Availability of Personnel
 
To maximize the cost effectiveness and productivity of clinical associates, Aveanna utilizes customized processes and procedures that have been developed and refined over the years. We use personalized matching techniques to recruit and select applicants who fit individual patients’ needs through initial applicant profiles, personal interviews, skill evaluations and reference checks. Aveanna utilizes a best in class iCIMS recruiting and applicant tracking platform in the sourcing, hiring, and onboarding of new personnel.
 
We recruit our clinical associates through a variety of sources, such as advertising in local and national media, job fairs, solicitations on websites, direct mail and telephone solicitations and referrals obtained directly from clients and other caregivers. Clinical associates are paid per visit, per hour, per diem, or are employed on a full-time salaried basis. Currently, we are experiencing a shortage of licensed clinicians, which has impacted our industry in general. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry”. The home health and hospice industries have historically experienced shortages in qualified clinicians and management personnel. These shortages increase competition for qualified candidates across the entire healthcare industry and may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.
 
Government Regulation
 
General
 
Aveanna’s business is subject to extensive federal, state and, in some instances, local regulations and standards which govern, among other things: Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE (the Department of Defense’s managed healthcare program for military personnel/retirees and their families) and other government-funded reimbursement programs; reporting requirements, certification and licensing standards and in some cases, Certificate of Need (“CON”) requirements for certain home health agencies and hospices.
 
Aveanna’s compliance with these regulations and standards may affect its participation in Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and other federal and state healthcare programs, as well as its ability to be reimbursed by private payers. Aveanna is also subject to a variety of federal and state regulations which prohibit fraud and abuse in the delivery of healthcare services. These regulations include, among other things: prohibitions against the offering or making of direct or indirect payments to actual or potential referral sources for obtaining or influencing patient referrals; rules generally prohibiting physicians from making referrals under Medicare and Medicaid for clinical

services to a home health agency with which the physician or his or her immediate family member has certain types of financial relationships; laws against the filing of false claims; and laws against making payment or offering items of value to patients to induce their self-referral to the provider. These regulations also include licensure, certification or other qualifications for various Aveanna personnel who provide our services.
 
We believe that healthcare services will continue to be subject to intense regulation at the federal and state levels. We are unable to predict what additional government regulations, if any, affecting our business may be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted. If we, or any of our locations, fail to comply with applicable laws, it might have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Licensure, Certificates of Need and Permits of Approval
 
Home health and hospice agency providers operate under licenses granted by the health authorities of their respective states. Some states require healthcare providers (including home health and hospice agencies) to obtain prior state approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of healthcare locations, capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount, or changes in services. For those states that require a CON or permit of approval (“POA”), the provider must also complete a separate application process establishing a location and must receive required approvals.
 
Certain states, including a number in which we operate, carefully restrict new entrants into the market based on demographic and/or demonstrative usage of additional providers. These states limit the entry of new providers or services and the expansion of existing providers or services in their markets through a CON process, which is periodically evaluated and updated as required by applicable state law.
 
To the extent that we would need a CON, POA, or other similar approvals to expand our operations, our expansion could be adversely affected by the inability to obtain the necessary approvals, changes in the standards applicable to those approvals and possible delays and expenses associated with obtaining those approvals.
 
In every state where required, our home health and hospice agencies possess a license and/or CON or POA issued by the state health authority that determines the local service area for the home health and hospice agencies. State health authorities in certain states and the District of Columbia require a CON or its equivalent in order to establish and operate a home health agency or hospice care center. We operate home health agencies and/or provide hospice services in the following CON states: Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Washington.
 
Medicare and Medicaid Participation: Licensing, Certification and Accreditation
 
All healthcare providers are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statues and regulations in the U.S. and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review compliance with standards of administration, medical care, equipment and safety. We have dedicated internal resources and utilize external parties when necessary to monitor and ensure compliance with the various applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.
 
Our home health and hospice agencies and caregivers must comply with regulations promulgated by HHS and CMS in order to participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare payments. Sections 1861(o) and 1891 of the Social Security Act (“SSA”) and 42 CFR Part 484 establish the conditions that a home health agency must meet in order to participate in the Medicare program. Among other things, these regulations, applicable to home health agencies, known as “Conditions of Participation” (“COPs”), relate to the type of facility, its personnel and its standards of medical care, as well as its compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. Recent COPs applicable to home health agencies, which went into effect on January 13, 2018, focus on the safe delivery of quality care provided to patients and the impact of that care on patient outcomes through the protection and promotion of patients’ rights, care planning, delivery and coordination of services and streamlining of regulatory requirements.
 
Section 1861(dd) of the SSA and 42 CFR Part 418 establish the conditions that a hospice must meet in order to participate in the Medicare program. These COPs set forth the health and safety requirements that a hospice must meet. They provide a framework for patient care, administrative and organizational processes, and quality improvement, as well as compliance with federal and state laws and regulations.
 
CMS has adopted alternative sanction enforcement options which allow CMS to (i) impose temporary management, direct plans of correction or direct training and (ii) impose payment suspensions and civil monetary penalties in each case on providers out of

compliance with the COPs. In addition, CMS engages or has engaged a number of third-party audit contractors to conduct an additional documentation request (known as an “ADR,” a request for a provider’s medical record documentation to review specific claims), and other third-party firms, including Recovery Audit Contractors, Program Safeguard Contractors, Zone Program Integrity Contractors, Uniform Program Integrity Contractors, Targeted Probe and Educate, Supplemental Medical Review Contractors and Medicaid Integrity Contractors, to conduct extensive reviews of claims data and state and federal government healthcare program laws and regulations applicable to healthcare providers. These audits evaluate the appropriateness of billings submitted for payment. In addition to identifying overpayments, audit contractors can refer suspected violations of law to government enforcement authorities.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our businesses) and exclusion of a service or facility, or Aveanna as a whole, from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If any of our services or facilities were to lose its accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the service or facility, or Aveanna as a whole, may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payers. We believe our facilities and services are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our services, facilities, equipment and personnel in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.
 
Accreditations
 
The Community Health Accreditation Program (the “CHAP”) and Accreditation Commission for Health Care (the “ACHC”) are nationwide commissions that establish standards relating to the physical plant, administration, quality of patient care and operation of medical staffs of healthcare organizations. Currently, CHAP and ACHC accreditation of home health, home care, hospice and our AMS division is voluntary. However, some managed care organizations use CHAP and ACHC accreditation as a credentialing standard for regional and state contracts. Aveanna has renewed its three year contract with CHAP and ACHC and has had a corporate survey. All locations are accredited and will undergo surveys over the next three years. As we acquire companies, we apply for accreditation 12 to 18 months after completing the acquisition.
 
Federal and State Anti-Fraud and Anti-Kickback Laws
 
As a provider under the Medicare and Medicaid systems, we are subject to various federal anti-fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal healthcare programs’ anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”). Affected government healthcare programs include any healthcare plans or programs that are funded by the United States government (other than certain federal employee health insurance benefits/programs), including certain state healthcare programs that receive federal funds, such as Medicaid. We are also subject to various state anti-fraud and kickback laws which govern both government program and private payer activity.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, these laws prohibit any offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce or reward the referral of business payable under a government healthcare program or in return for the purchase, lease, order, arranging for, or recommendation of items or services covered under a government healthcare program. A related law forbids the offer or transfer of anything of value, including certain waivers of co-payment obligations and deductible amounts, to a beneficiary of Medicare or Medicaid that is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of healthcare providers, again, subject to certain exceptions. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in imprisonment, the imposition of penalties topping $100,000, plus three times the amount of the improper remuneration and potentially, exclusion from furnishing services under any government healthcare program. In addition, the states in which we operate generally have laws, similar to the various federal anti-fraud and abuse laws, that prohibit certain direct or indirect payment or fee-splitting arrangements between healthcare providers and/or other persons and entities where such arrangements are designed or used to obtain or induce the referral of patients from a particular person or provider.
 
We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to monitor and address prevention of anti-fraud and kickback laws.
 
Stark Law
 
Federal law includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits a physician (defined to include a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a doctor of dental surgery or dental medicine, a doctor of podiatric medicine, a doctor of optometry, or a chiropractor) from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to certain types of entities with which the physician or any of the

physician’s immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception to the law’s prohibition is met. Subject to adherence to their respective criteria requirements, the self-referral prohibition contains a number of exceptions, including exceptions covering employment or independent contractor arrangements, space and equipment leases, and recruitment agreements.
 
Sanctions within Stark Law include significant civil penalties including over $25,000 for each violation, over $169,000 for schemes to circumvent the Stark Law restrictions and up to $10,000 for each day an entity fails to report required information and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs. Violations of the Stark Law may also result in payment denials, false claim recoveries, civil monetary penalties, and/or federal program exclusion.
 
On November 20, 2020, CMS issued a final rule modernizing and clarifying the Stark Law regulations. This final rule was an attempt by CMS to reduce the unnecessary regulatory burdens on physicians and other healthcare providers while reinforcing the Stark Law’s goal of protecting patients from unnecessary services and being steered to lower quality or more expensive services because of a physician’s financial self-interest. The final rule created new exceptions to the Stark Law for value-based care arrangements by permitting physicians and other healthcare providers to design and enter into value-based care arrangements. Additionally, the final rule modified existing exceptions governing compensation provided to a physician by another healthcare provider by providing new guidance on how to determine fair market value.
 
Several of the states in which we conduct business have also enacted statutes similar in scope and purpose to the federal fraud and abuse laws and the Stark Law. These state laws may mirror the federal Stark Law or may be different in scope. The available guidance and enforcement activity associated with such state laws varies considerably.
 
We monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.
 
Federal and State Privacy and Security Laws
 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) requires our covered entities to comply with standards for the exchange of health information within our company and with third parties, such as payers, business associates and patients. These include standards for common healthcare transactions, such as: claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures; unique identifiers for providers, employers, health plans and individuals; and security, privacy, breach notification and enforcement. Under HIPAA, a “covered entity” includes healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses and health plans/insurers, and a “business associate” is a person or entity, other than a member of the workforce of a covered entity, who performs functions or activities on behalf of, or provides certain services to, a covered entity that involve access by the business associate to protected health information.
 
HIPAA transaction regulations establish form, format and data content requirements for most electronic healthcare transactions, such as healthcare claims that are submitted electronically. The HIPAA privacy regulations establish comprehensive requirements relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information. The HIPAA security regulations establish minimum standards for the protection of protected health information that is stored or transmitted electronically. The HIPAA breach notification regulations establish the applicable requirements for notifying individuals, the HHS, and the media in the event of a data breach affecting protected health information. Violations of the privacy, security and breach notification regulations are punishable by civil and criminal penalties.
 
The American Recovery and Economic Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) increased the amount of civil monetary penalties that can be imposed for violations of HIPAA, and the amounts are updated annually for inflation. For 2023, penalties for HIPAA violations can range from $127 to $1.919 million per violation with a maximum fine of $1.919 million for identical violations during a calendar year. ARRA also authorized State Attorneys General to bring civil enforcement actions under HIPAA, and attorney generals are actively engaged in enforcement. These penalties could be in addition to other penalties assessed by a state for a breach which would be considered reportable under the state’s data breach notification laws.
 
The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”) was enacted in conjunction with ARRA. Among other things, the HITECH Act makes business associates of covered entities directly liable for compliance with certain HIPAA requirements, strengthens the limitations on the use and disclosure of protected health information without individual authorizations, and adopts the additional HITECH Act enhancements, including enforcement of noncompliance with HIPAA due to willful neglect. The changes to HIPAA enacted as part of ARRA reflect a Congressional intent that HIPAA’s privacy and security provisions be more

strictly enforced. These changes have stimulated increased enforcement activity and enhanced the potential that healthcare providers will be subject to financial penalties for violations of HIPAA. In addition, the Secretary of HHS is required to perform periodic audits to ensure covered entities (and their business associates, as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HIPAA requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action.

Health care providers, including Home Health Agencies ("HHAs") and hospices, are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information. On April 5, 2021, for example, health care providers and certain other entities became subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act that prohibit practices that may interfere with the access, exchange, or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties of up to $1 million per violation and/or other disincentives.
 
In addition to the federal HIPAA regulations, most states also have laws that regulate the collection, storage, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of health information and other confidential, sensitive and personal data. Certain of these laws grant individual rights with respect to their information, and we may be required to expend significant resources to comply with these laws. For example, various states, such as California and Massachusetts, have implemented privacy laws and regulations, such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, that impose restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including protected health information (“PHI”). These laws in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, the HIPAA rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies.
 
Further, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted data breach notification laws that impose, in varying degrees, an obligation to notify affected persons and/or state regulators in the event of a data breach or compromise, including when their personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. Some state breach notification laws may also impose physical and electronic security requirements regarding the safeguarding of personal information, such as social security numbers and bank and credit card account numbers. Moreover, states have been frequently amending existing laws, requiring attention to changing regulatory requirements. Violation of state privacy, security, and breach notification laws can trigger significant monetary penalties. In addition, certain states’ privacy, security, and data breach laws, including, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), include a private right of action that may expose us to private litigation regarding our privacy practices and significant damages awards or settlements in civil litigation. Complying with these various laws, rules, regulations and standards, and with any new laws or regulations changes to existing laws, could cause us to incur substantial costs that are likely to increase over time, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and restrict the way products and services involving data are offered.
 
The False Claims Act
 
The federal False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729, et seq., (“FCA”) prohibits false claims or requests for payment, for which payment may be made by a federal government program, including for healthcare services. Under the FCA, the federal government may penalize any person who knowingly submits, or participates in submitting, claims for payment to the federal government which are false or fraudulent, or which contain false information. Any person who knowingly makes or uses a false record or statement to avoid paying the federal government, or knowingly conceals or avoids an obligation to pay money to the federal government, may also be subject to fines under the FCA. Under the FCA, the term “person” means an individual, company or corporation.
 
The federal government has used the FCA to cover Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental program fraud in areas such as violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or the Stark Laws, coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. The FCA has also been used to bring suit against people or entities that bill services at a higher reimbursement rate than is allowed and that bill for care that is not medically necessary. In addition to government enforcement, the FCA authorizes private citizens to bring qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits, greatly extending the number of actions under the FCA. The per-claim penalty range is between $13,508 and $27,018 (last updated 2023).
 
The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (“FERA”) amended the FCA with the intent of enhancing the powers of government enforcement authorities and whistleblowers to bring FCA cases. In particular, FERA attempts to clarify that liability may be established not only for false claims submitted directly to the government, but also for claims submitted to government contractors and grantees. FERA also seeks to clarify that liability exists for attempts to avoid repayment of overpayments, including improper retention of federal funds. FERA also included amendments to FCA procedures, expanding the government’s ability to use the Civil Investigative Demand process to investigate defendants, and permitting government complaints in intervention to relate back to the filing of the whistleblower’s original complaint. FERA has increased both the volume and liability exposure of FCA cases brought against healthcare providers.
 

In the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education and Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), Congress enacted requirements related to identifying and returning overpayments made under Medicare and Medicaid. CMS finalized regulations regarding this so-called “60-day rule,” which requires providers to report and return Medicare and Medicaid overpayments within 60 days of identifying the same. A provider who retains identified overpayments beyond 60 days may be liable under the FCA. “Identification” occurs when a person “has, or should have through the exercise of reasonable diligence,” identified and quantified the amount of an overpayment. The final rule also established a six-year lookback period, meaning overpayments must be reported and returned if a person identifies the overpayment within six years of the date the overpayment was received. A provider must report and return overpayments even if the provider did not cause the overpayment.
 
In addition to the FCA, the federal government may use several criminal statutes to prosecute the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government. Many states have false claims laws similar to the FCA that impose liability for the types of acts prohibited by the FCA. As part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the “DRA”), Congress provided states an incentive to adopt state false claims acts consistent with the federal FCA. Additionally, the DRA required providers who receive $5 million or more annually from Medicaid to include information on federal and state false claims acts, whistleblower protections and the providers’ own policies on detecting and preventing fraud in their written employee policies.
 
Governmental Review, Audits and Investigations
 
The HHS, CMS, Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and other federal and state agencies continue to impose intensive enforcement policies and conduct random and directed audits, reviews, and investigations designed to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare program participation and payment laws and regulations. As a result, we are routinely the subject of such audits, reviews, and investigations.
 
The DOJ, CMS or other federal and state enforcement and regulatory agencies may conduct additional investigations related to the Company’s businesses in the future. These audits and investigations could potentially cause delays in collections, recoupments, retroactive adjustment to amounts previously paid from governmental payers. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any regulatory and other governmental audits and investigations. While such audits and investigations are the subject of administrative appeals, the appeals process, even if successful, may take several years to resolve. The Company’s costs to respond to and defend any such audits, reviews and investigations could be significant and are likely to increase in the current enforcement environment.
 
FDA Regulation
 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates medical device user facilities, which include home health providers. FDA regulations require user facilities to report patient deaths and serious injuries to the FDA and/or the manufacturer of a device used by the facility if the device may have caused or contributed to the death or serious injury of any patient. FDA regulations also require user facilities to maintain files related to adverse events and to establish and implement appropriate procedures to ensure compliance with the above reporting and recordkeeping requirements. User facilities are subject to FDA inspection, and noncompliance with applicable requirements may result in warning letters or sanctions including civil monetary penalties, injunction, product seizure, criminal fines and/or imprisonment.
 
The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act
 
In October 2014, the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the “IMPACT Act”) was signed into law requiring the reporting of standardized patient assessment data for quality improvement, payment and discharge planning purposes across the spectrum of post-acute care providers (“PACs”), including skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. The IMPACT Act required PACs to begin reporting: (1) standardized patient assessment data at admission and discharge by October 1, 2018 for PACs, including skilled nursing facilities and by January 1, 2019 for home health agencies; (2) new quality measures, including functional status, skin integrity, medication reconciliation, incidence of major falls and patient preference regarding treatment and discharge at various intervals between October 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019; and (3) resource use measures, including Medicare spending per beneficiary, discharge to community and hospitalization rates of potentially preventable readmissions by January 1, 2016 for PACs, including skilled nursing facilities and by October 1, 2017 for home health agencies. Failure to report such data when required would subject a facility to a 2.0% reduction in market basket prices then in effect.
 
The IMPACT Act further requires HHS and MedPAC, a commission chartered by Congress to advise it on Medicare payment issues, to study alternative PAC payment models, including payment based upon individual patient characteristics and not care setting, with corresponding Congressional reports required based on such analysis. The IMPACT Act also included provisions impacting Medicare-certified hospices, including: (1) increasing survey frequency for Medicare-certified hospices to once every 36 months; (2) imposing a

medical review process for facilities with a high percentage of stays in excess of 180 days; and (3) updating the annual aggregate Medicare payment cap.
 
Pre-Claim Review Demonstration for Home Health Services
 
On June 8, 2016, CMS announced the implementation of a three-year Medicare pre-claim review (“PCR”) demonstration for home health services provided to beneficiaries in the states of Illinois, Florida, Texas, Michigan and Massachusetts. The PCR is a process through which a request for provisional affirmation of coverage is submitted for review before a final claim is submitted for payment. On April 1, 2017, CMS paused the PCR Demonstration for home health services while CMS considered a number of changes. CMS revised the demonstration to incorporate more flexibility and choices for providers, as well as risk-based changes to reward providers who show compliance with Medicare home health policies.
 
On May 31, 2018, CMS issued a notice indicating its intention to re-launch a home health agency PCR demonstration project. Now called the Review Choice Demonstration for Home Health Services (“RCD”), the revised demonstration gave home health agencies in the demonstration states 3 options: PCR of all claims, post-payment review of all claims, or minimal post-payment review with a 25% payment reduction for all home health services. Under the PCR and post-payment review options, provider claims are reviewed for every episode of care until the appropriate claim approval rate (90% based on a minimum of 10 pre-claim requests or claims submitted) is reached. Further, once the appropriate claim approval rate is reached, a provider can elect to opt-out of claim reviews except for a spot check of 5% of its claims to ensure continued compliance. The demonstration initially applies to home health agency providers in Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas, with the option to expand after 5 years to other states in the Medicare Administrative Contractor Jurisdiction M (Palmetto). On October 21, 2019, CMS announced that it would reschedule the next phase of its RCD to allow agencies time to transition to the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (“PDGM”). CMS announced that RCD implementation would resume on March 2, 2020 in Texas, followed by demonstrations in North Carolina and Florida on May 4, 2020. The choice selection period began on January 15, 2020 and ended on February 13, 2020 for home health agencies located in Texas. Following the close of the choice selection period, the demonstration was expected to begin in Texas on March 2, 2020, and all periods of care starting on or after this date would be subject to the requirements of the choice selected. However, on March 30, 2020, CMS announced a pause of certain claims processing requirements for the RCD in Illinois, Ohio, and Texas until the Public Health Emergency (“PHE”) for the COVID-19 pandemic has ended. In addition, CMS announced that the demonstration would not begin in North Carolina and Florida on May 4, 2020, as previously scheduled. On July 7, 2020, CMS announced that CMS would discontinue exercising enforcement discretion RCD, beginning on August 3, 2020, regardless of the status of the PHE. CMS announced that the initial choice selection period would begin in North Carolina and Florida on August 3, 2020 and end on August 17, 2020, and that the choice selection period for Ohio’s second review cycle would also begin August 3, 2020 and end on August 17, 2020. On December 22, 2020, CMS delayed the initial choice selection period for Florida and North Carolina and announced that selection period would begin in Florida and North Carolina on March 31, 2021. CMS further delayed the initial choice selection period for Florida and North Carolina and began full implementation of RCD on September 1, 2021 for Florida and North Carolina. On April 1, 2022, CMS implemented the 25% payment reduction in North Carolina and Florida where applicable for providers who selected minimal post-payment review.
 
Home Health Value-Based Purchasing
 
On January 1, 2016, CMS implemented the Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (“HHVBP”) model. The HHVBP model was designed to give Medicare-certified home health agencies incentives or penalties, through payment bonuses, to give higher quality and more efficient care. HHVBP was rolled out to nine pilot states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, North Carolina, Tennessee and Washington, six of which Aveanna currently has home health operations. Bonuses and penalties began in 2018 with the maximum of plus or minus 3% growing to plus or minus 8% by 2022. Payment adjustments are calculated based on performance in 20 measures which include current Quality of Patient Care and Patient Satisfaction star measures, as well as measures based on submission of data to a CMS web portal. The measures used may be subject to modification or change by CMS. Under the demonstration, home health agencies with higher performance receive bonuses, while those with lower scores receive lower payments relative to current levels. Home health agency performance is evaluated against separate improvement and attainment scores, with payment tied to the higher of these two scores. CMS used 2015 as the baseline year for performance, with 2016 as the first year for performance measurement. The first payment adjustment began January 1, 2018, based on 2016 performance data. Between 2018 and 2022, the payment adjustment varies (upward or downward) from 3% to 8%.
 
CMS ended the HHVBP demonstration on December 31, 2021. Effective January 1, 2023, the Expanded HHVBP model will be effective in all 50 states. Under this new model, CMS will use 2022 for all home health agencies that were certified prior to January 1, 2022 as the baseline year for performance, with 2023 as the first year for performance measurement. The first payment adjustment will begin January 1, 2025, based on 2023 performance data. Bonuses and penalties will begin in 2023 with the maximum of plus or minus 5%.



Home Health Payment Reform
 
On February 9, 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (“BBA of 2018”), which funded government operations, set two-year government spending limits and enacted a variety of healthcare related policies. Specific to home health, the BBA of 2018 provided for a targeted extension of the home health rural add-on payment, a reduction of the 2020 market basket update, modification of eligibility documentation requirements and reform to the Home Health Prospective Payment Systems (“HHPPS”). The HHPPS reform included the following parameters: for home health units of service beginning on January 1, 2020, a 30-day payment system will apply; the transition to the 30-day payment system must be budget neutral; and CMS must conduct at least one Technical Expert Panel during 2018, prior to any notice and comment rulemaking process, related to the design of any new case-mix adjustment model.
 
The final home health agency regulations introduced by CMS (CMS-1689-FC) updated the Medicare HHPPS and finalized the implementation of an alternative case-mix adjustment methodology, PDGM, that became effective on January 1, 2020. The PDGM adjusted payments to home health agencies providing home health services under Medicare Fee-For-Service based on patient characteristics for 30-day periods of care and also eliminated the use of therapy visits in the determination of payments. While the changes were to be implemented in a budget neutral manner to the industry, the ultimate impact will vary by provider based on factors including patient mix and admission source. Additionally, CMS made assumptions about behavioral changes which were finalized in the 2020 Final Rule released on October 31, 2019 (CMS-1711-FC). CMS assumed that home health agencies will change their documentation and coding practices and will put the highest paying diagnosis code as the principal diagnosis code in order to have a 30-day period be placed into a higher-paying clinical group. Initially, CMS proposed an 8.1% reduction in the base payment rate for a 30-day period of care to ensure overall budget neutrality in Medicare home health spending in 2020. In the 2021 Final Rule, CMS increased the base payment by 1.9%. Notably, CMS is required by the law to analyze data for CYs 2020-2026, retrospectively, to determine the impact of the difference between assumed and actual behavior changes and to make any such payment changes as are necessary to offset or supplement the adjustments based on anticipated behavior. Additionally, in an effort to eliminate fraud risks, CMS phased out RAPs for 2020 and fully eliminated RAPs for calendar year 2021. Beginning January 1, 2022, home health providers were required to submit a Notice of Admission (“NOA”) within five calendar days of the first 30-day period.
 
Durable Medical Equipment (DME) Medicare Administrative Contractor
 
Some of our products are classified as Durable Medical Equipment (“DME”) under Medicare regulations. In order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries only receive medically necessary and appropriate items and services, the Medicare program has adopted a number of documentation requirements. For example, certain provisions under CMS guidance manuals, local coverage determinations, and the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractor (“DME MAC”) Supplier Manuals provide that clinical information from the “patient’s medical record” is required to justify the initial and ongoing medical necessity for the provision of DME. Some DME MACs, CMS staff and other government contractors have recently taken the position, among other things, that the “patient’s medical record” refers not to documentation maintained by the DME supplier but instead to documentation maintained by the patient’s physician, healthcare facility or other clinician, and that clinical information created by the DME supplier’s personnel and confirmed by the patient’s physician is not sufficient to establish medical necessity. If treating physicians do not adequately document, among other things, their diagnoses and plans of care, the risks that Aveanna will be subject to audits and payment denials are likely to increase. Moreover, auditors’ interpretations of these policies are inconsistent and subject to individual interpretation, leading to significant increases in individual supplier and industry-wide perceived error rates. High error rates could lead to further audit activity and regulatory burdens and could result in Aveanna making significant refunds and other payments to Medicare and other government programs. Accordingly, Aveanna’s future revenues and cash flows from government healthcare programs may be reduced. Private payers also may conduct audits and may take legal action to recover alleged overpayments. Our MS segment could be adversely affected in some of the markets in which it operates if the auditing payer alleges substantial overpayments were made to Aveanna due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations.
 
Federal and state budgetary and other cost-containment pressures will continue to impact the DME industry. We cannot predict whether new federal and state budgetary proposals will be adopted or the effect, if any, such proposals would have on its financial condition and results of operations.
 
Quality Improvement and Regulatory Services
 
Aveanna performs quality improvement and regulatory services. The Company has set forth a quality platform that reviews:
 •Performance improvement audits; 
 •CHAP standards;


•ACHC standards; 
 •State and regulatory surveys;
 •Publicly reported quality data; and
 •Patient perception of care. 
 
As part of our ongoing quality control, internal auditing, and monitoring programs, we conduct internal clinical, quality, and compliance audits at our branch locations. If a location does not achieve a satisfactory rating, we require that it prepare and implement a plan of correction. We then follow-up to verify that all deficiencies identified in the initial audit and survey have been corrected.
 
We constantly expand and refine our continuous quality improvement programs. Specific written policies, procedures, training, and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities, have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Our programs also address specific areas identified for improvement through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities. We believe our consistent focus on continuous quality improvement programs provide us with a competitive advantage in the markets we serve.
 
Our Training and Compliance Programs
 
The Company has established and continually maintains a comprehensive compliance program that is designed to assist all of our employees to exceed applicable standards established by federal and state laws and regulations and industry practice. Our goal is to foster and maintain the highest standards of compliance, ethics, integrity, and professionalism in every aspect of our business dealings, and we utilize our compliance program to assist our employees toward achieving that goal.
 
The purpose of our compliance and ethics program is to promote and foster compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs, industry standards, our Code of Conduct, and our other policies and procedures that support and enhance overall compliance within our Company. Our compliance program focuses on regulations related to the federal False Claims Act, the Stark Law, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, fraud, waste and abuse, privacy, billing, and overall adherence to healthcare regulations.
 
The Company performs many compliance program activities, such as:
 
•drafting and revising the Company’s policies and procedures related to compliance and ethics issues;

 •monthly verification that current and potential employees are not classified as an excluded individual who is prohibited from participation in any federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid;
 •implementing an annual compliance auditing and monitoring work plan and performing and following up on various risk-based auditing and monitoring activities, including both clinical and non-clinical auditing and monitoring activities at the corporate level and at the local agency/facility level; 
 •developing, implementing and overseeing our HIPAA privacy and security compliance program;
 •monitoring, responding to and overseeing the resolution of issues and concerns raised through our anonymous compliance hotline;
 •monitoring, responding to and resolving all compliance and ethics-related issues and concerns raised through any other form of communication; and
 •ensuring that we take appropriate corrective and disciplinary action when noncompliant or improper conduct is identified.
 
All employees are required to report incidents, issues or other concerns that they believe in good faith may be in violation of our Code of Conduct, our policies and procedures, applicable legal and regulatory requirements or the requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other government healthcare programs. We maintain a strong stance against retaliation against any employee that submits in good faith report of a concern to our compliance department.



We believe we have best-in-class nurse training and compliance capabilities that differentiate our recruiting and retention of nurses as well as establish long-lasting relationships with referral sources and payers. Our robust compliance program is led by a seasoned and experienced Chief Compliance Officer who seeks to hold the Company’s employees to a consistent, high standard, with required compliance training and annual audits. Emblematic of our commitment to compliance, all members of our management team and Board of Directors are required to complete the same training and knowledge assessments as our employees. This is designed to ensure that the culture of compliance reaches the highest levels of management within our Company.
 
We maintain a compliance hotline for all employees and have stringent compliance reporting on an annual basis. Our branch and nurse managers are held personally accountable for our compliance culture, and their incentive compensation is tied to a balanced scorecard that includes clinical quality as a key performance indicator. In addition, we continue to make significant investments in training for nurses and have increased the emphasis on clinical, training and compliance since the Formation. The Company has developed a national nurse training program that is widely sought after as an educational investment by nurses. Our investments in compliance and training have resulted in a very strong track record of patient safety, with an average of less than one patient safety-related injury per 1,900,000 hours of service provided from 2018 to date. We also have demonstrated a low hospital readmission rate, enjoy strong satisfaction scores in patient surveys and benefit from a strong reputation with referral sources.
 
Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,700 full-time support staff personnel with the remainder of our 30,000 employees employed on a part-time, temporary, per-diem or full-time basis. All of our employees, with the exception of certain executives with employment agreements, work with us on an at-will basis and none are union members or subject to any collective bargaining agreements.
