ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview



 Future FinTech is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida and it is not a Chinese operating company. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our subsidiaries and contractual arrangements with a variable interest entity (VIE) – Cloud Chain E-Commerce (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., formerly known as Chain Cloud Mall E-Commerce (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. (“E-Commerce Tianjin”), based in China and this structure involves unique risks to investors. The Company historically engaged in the production and sale of fruit juice concentrates (including fruit purees and fruit juices), fruit beverages (including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages) in People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”). Due to drastically increased production costs and tightened environmental laws in China, the Company had transformed its business from fruit juice manufacturing and distribution to a real-name blockchain based e-commerce platform, supply chain financing services and trading business and financial technology business. The main business of the Company includes an online shopping platform, Chain Cloud Mall (“CCM”), which is based on blockchain technology; supply chain financing services and trading, financial technology service business and the application and development of blockchain-based technology in financial technology services. The Company has also expanded into financial services and cryptocurrency market data and information service businesses.



 There are legal and operational risks associated with being based in and having majority of our operations in Hong Kong and China. Recently, the PRC government initiated a series of regulatory actions and statements to regulate business operations in China with little advance notice, including cracking down on illegal activities in the securities market, enhancing supervision over China-based companies listed overseas using variable interest entity structure, adopting new measures to extend the scope of cybersecurity reviews, and expanding the efforts in anti-monopoly enforcement. On July 6, 2021, the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued an announcement to crack down on illegal activities in the securities market and promote the high-quality development of the capital market, which, among other things, requires the relevant governmental authorities to strengthen cross-border oversight of law-enforcement and judicial cooperation, to enhance supervision over China-based companies listed overseas, and to establish and improve the system of extraterritorial application of the PRC securities laws. On December 28, 2021, Cybersecurity Review Measures published by Cyberspace Administration of China or the CAC, National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of State Security, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Commerce, People’s Bank of China, State Administration of Radio and Television, China Securities Regulatory Commission, State Secrecy Administration and State Cryptography Administration, effective on February 15, 2022, which provides that, Critical Information Infrastructure Operators (“CIIOs”) that purchase internet products and services and Data Processing Operators (“DPOs”) engaging in data processing activities that affect or may affect national security shall be subject to the cybersecurity review by the Cybersecurity Review Office. On November 14, 2021, CAC published the Administration Measures for Cyber Data Security (Draft for Public Comments), or the “Cyber Data Security Measure (Draft)”, which requires cyberspace operators with personal information of more than 1 million users who want to list abroad to file a cybersecurity review with the Office of Cybersecurity Review. As of the date of this report, these new laws and guidelines have not impacted the Company’s ability to conduct its business, accept foreign investments, or list and trade on a U.S. or other foreign exchange; however, there are uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of these new laws and guidelines, which could materially and adversely impact our business and financial outlook and may impact our ability to accept foreign investments or continue to list on a U.S. or other foreign exchange. Any change in foreign investment regulations, and other policies in China or related enforcement actions by Chinese government could result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer our securities to investors or cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or be worthless. The Company’s auditor is headquartered in the U.S. and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”) currently has access to inspect the working papers of our auditor and our auditor is not subject to the determinations announced by the PCAOB on December 16, 2021. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCA Act, was enacted on December 18, 2020. In accordance with the HFCA Act, trading in securities of any registrant on a national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter trading market in the United States may be prohibited if the PCAOB determines that it cannot inspect or fully investigate the registrant’s auditor for three consecutive years beginning in 2021, and, as a result, an exchange may determine to delist the securities of such registrant. On June 22, 2021, the U.S. Senate passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, which, if enacted, would amend the HFCA Act and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer’s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three, thus reducing the time period before our securities may be prohibited from trading or delisted if our auditor is unable to meet the PCAOB inspection requirement. The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and related regulations currently does not affect the Company as the Company’s auditor is subject to PCAOB’s inspections and investigations. However, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely our auditor because of a position taken by an authority in a foreign jurisdiction or any other reasons, the lack of inspection could cause the trading in our securities to be prohibited under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, and as a result Nasdaq may delist our securities.



 As a holding company, we may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements. If any of our subsidiaries or our WFOE incurs debt on its own behalf in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. However, neither any of our subsidiaries or the VIE has made any dividends, other distributions or cash transfers to our holding company or any U.S. investors as of the date of this report. In the future, cash proceeds raised from overseas financing activities may be transferred by us to our PRC subsidiaries via capital contribution or shareholder loans, as the case may be. As a holding company, we may rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements we may have. As of the date of this report, we do not have cash management policies and procedures in place that dictate how funds are transferred through our organization. Rather, the funds can be transferred in accordance with the applicable PRC laws and regulations. See “Dividend Distribution and Cash Transfer Between the Holding Company, Subsidiary and VIE” and “Selected Condensed Consolidated Financial Schedule of the Company and Its Subsidiaries and VIE.





1







 As of the date of this report, no dividends or distributions have been made between the holding company, its subsidiaries, and consolidated VIE, or to investors other than U.S. investors. The holding company, its subsidiaries, and the VIE do not have any plan to distribute dividend or settle amounts owed under the VIE Agreements in the foreseeable future. To the extent cash and/or assets in the business are in the PRC and/or Hong Kong or our PRC and/or Hong Kong entities, the VIE, and the WFOE (as defined below), such funds and/or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries by the PRC government to transfer cash and/or assets. See “Dividend Distribution and Cash Transfer Between the Holding Company, Subsidiary and VIE.” and “Risk Factor - We could be restricted from paying dividends to shareholders due to PRC laws and other contractual requirements. To the extent cash and/or assets in the business are in the PRC and/or Hong Kong or our PRC and/or Hong Kong entities, the VIE, and the WFOE, such funds and/or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries by the PRC government to transfer cash and/or assets.”



 In the opinion of our PRC counsel Fengdong Law Firm, the VIE and certain subsidiaries of the Company are incorporated and operating in mainland China and they have received all required permissions from Chinese authorities to operate their current business in China, including Business licenses, Bank Account Open Permits and Value Added Telecom Business License. Our subsidiaries outside of mainland China also have obtained permissions or approvals to operate their business in the countries where they operate their business.



 As of the date of this report, in the opinion of our PRC counsel Fengdong Law Firm, we, our subsidiaries and the VIE in China are not subject to permission requirements from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (“CSRC”), Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”) or any other entity that is required to approve of the VIE’s operations and have not received or were denied such permissions by any PRC authorities. Nevertheless, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the “Opinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law,” or the Opinions, which were made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Given the current PRC regulatory environment, it is uncertain when and whether we, our subsidiaries or the VIE, might be required to obtain permission from the PRC government to offer our securities to foreign investors in the future, and even when such permission is obtained, whether it will be denied or rescinded. If we or any of our subsidiaries or the VIE do not receive or maintain such permissions or approvals, inadvertently conclude that such permissions or approvals are not required, or applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and we or our subsidiaries are required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, it could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer our securities to investors and cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. If applicable laws, regulations, or interpretations change and the VIE is required to obtain such permissions or approvals in the future, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can obtain such permissions or approvals in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to take timely and appropriate measures to adapt to any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations. In addition, these VIE agreements have not been truly tested in the courts in China and Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow the VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or value of our securities, including that it could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. The VIE structure is used to provide investors with exposure to foreign investment in China-based companies where Chinese law prohibits or restricts direct foreign investment in certain types of operating companies, and that investors may never hold equity interests in the VIE. See “Risk Factor - If the PRC government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to the consolidated variable interest entity do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.”

 Currently, Chain Cloud Mall adopts an “Enterprise Communication as A Service” or eCAAS platform which is a part of 3.15 China Responsible Brand Program run by the Anti-Counterfeiting Committee of China Foundation of Consumer Protection (the “Anti-Counterfeiting Committee”). Anti-Counterfeiting Committee reviews and accepts the companies to join its 3.15 China Responsible Brand Program. After acceptance, these companies are authorized to use anti-counterfeiting labels on their products which have authenticated signatures of these companies and Anti-Counterfeiting Committee recorded on the blockchain quality and safety traceability system controlled by the Anti-Counterfeiting Committee. The companies will sell such products on our eCAAS platform. The companies can also use sales agents to sell their products on our eCAAS platform and parties can negotiate the commission percentages for the products sold.

 The Company started its trial operation of NONOGIRL, a cross-border e-commerce platform, in March 2020 and formally launched it in July 2020. The cross-border e-commerce platform aimed to build a new s2b2c (supplier to business and consumer) outsourcing sales platform dominated by social media influencers. It was aimed at the growing female consumer market, with the ability to broadcast, short video, and all forms communication through the platform. It could also create a sales oriented sharing ecosystem with other major social media used by customers, etc. The Company’s promotion strategy previously mainly relied on the training of members and distributors through meetings and conferences. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government put a restriction on large gatherings. These restrictions made the promotion strategy for our online e-commerce platforms difficult to implement and the Company has experienced difficulties to subscribe new members for its online e-commerce platforms. Due to the lack of new subscribers, in June 2021, the Company suspended its cross-border e-commerce platform (NONOGIRL).

 VIE Contractual Arrangements



 On July 31, 2019, Cloud Chain Network and Technology (Tianjin) Co., Limited (“CCM Network” or “CCM Tianjin”, formerly known as Chain Cloud Mall Network and Technology (Tianjin) Co., Limited), Cloud Chain E-Commerce (Tianjin) Co., Ltd., formerly known as Chain Cloud Mall E-Commerce (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. (“E-Commerce Tianjin”), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of China, and Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu, citizens of China and together 100% shareholders of E-Commerce Tianjin, entered into the following agreements, or collectively, the “Variable Interest Entity Agreements” or “VIE Agreements,” pursuant to which CCM Network has contractual rights to control and operate the business of E-commerce Tianjin (the “VIE”). Mr. Zeyao Xue is a major shareholder of the Company and the son of Mr. Yongke Xue, the President of the Company. Mr. Kai Xu was the Chief Operating Officer of the Company then and currently is the Deputy General Manager of FT Commercial Group Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the vice president of blockchain division of the Company. The VIE is consolidated for accounting purposes but is not an entity in which we own equity.



 Pursuant to Chinese law and regulations, a foreign owned enterprise cannot apply for and hold a license for operation of certain e-commerce businesses. CCM Network is an indirectly wholly foreign owned enterprise of the Company (“WFOE”). In order to comply with Chinese law and regulations, CCM Network agreed to provide E-Commerce Tianjin an Exclusive Operation and Use Rights Authorization to operate and use the Chain Cloud Mall System owned by CCM Network. Although the VIE Contractual Arrangements have been widely adopted by PRC companies seeking for listing aboard, such arrangements have not been truly tested in any of the PRC courts. There are very few precedents as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a consolidated variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC laws. In addition, these VIE agreements have not been truly tested in the courts in China and Chinese regulatory authorities could disallow the VIE structure, which would likely result in a material change in our operations and/or value of our securities, including that it could cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or become worthless. The VIE structure is used to provide investors with exposure to foreign investment in China-based companies where Chinese law prohibits or restricts direct foreign investment in certain types of operating companies, and that investors may never hold equity interests in the VIE. If the consolidated VIE or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements.



 The following is a summary of the currently effective contractual arrangements relating to E-Commerce Tianjin.



 Contractual Arrangements with The Consolidated Affiliated Entity and Its Respective Shareholders



 The contractual arrangements with the VIE and its shareholders allow us to consolidate financial results of the VIE in our financial statements because we have satisfied conditions for consolidation of the VIE under U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which E-Commerce Tianjin is considered a VIE under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810 “Consolidation”, because the equity investments in E-Commerce Tianjin no longer have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, and the Company, through CCM Network, is the primary beneficiary of E-Commerce Tianjin for accounting purposes. A VIE is an entity that either has a total equity investment that is insufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as through voting rights, right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. The variable interest holder, if any, that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of, and must consolidate, the VIE. CCM Network has a controlling financial interest in, receives the economic benefits from, is the primary beneficiary of and has the power to direct the activities of the VIE to the extent that it has satisfied the conditions for consolidation of the VIE under U.S. GAAP. Pursuant to the contractual arrangements with CCM Network, E-Commerce Tianjin shall pay service fees equal to all of its net profit after tax to CCM Network. Such contractual arrangements are designed so that the E-Commerce Tianjin would operate for the benefit of CCM Network and ultimately, the Company.



 As a result of the contractual arrangements with the VIE, we are regarded as the primary beneficiary of the VIE for accounting purposes, and we treat the VIE and its subsidiaries as the consolidated affiliated entities under U.S. GAAP. We have consolidated the financial results of the VIE in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.



 Exclusive Technology Consulting and Service Agreement.



 Pursuant to the Exclusive Technology Consulting and Service Agreement, CCM Network agreed to act as the exclusive consultant of E-Commerce Tianjin and provide technology consulting and services to E-Commerce Tianjin. In exchange, E-Commerce Tianjin agreed to pay CCM Network a technology consulting and service fee, the amount of which is to be equivalent to the amount of net profit before tax of E-Commerce Tianjin, payable on a quarterly basis after making up losses of previous years (if necessary) and deducting necessary costs and expenses related to the business operations of E-Commerce Tianjin. Without the prior written consent of CCM Network, E-Commerce Tianjin may not accept the same or similar technology consulting and services provided by any third party during the term of the agreement. All the benefits and interests generated from the agreement, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, know-how and trade secrets, will be CCM Network’s sole and exclusive property. This agreement has a term of 10 years and may be extended unilaterally by CCM Network with CCM Network’s written confirmation prior to the expiration date. E-Commerce Tianjin cannot terminate the agreement early unless CCM Network commits fraud, gross negligence or illegal acts, or becomes bankrupt or winds up.





5







 Exclusive Purchase Option Agreement and Power of Attorney.



 Pursuant to the Exclusive Purchase Option Agreement, Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu granted to CCM Network and any party designated by CCM Network the exclusive right to purchase, at any time during the term of this agreement, all or part of the equity interests in E-Commerce Tianjin, or the “Equity Interests,” at a purchase price equal to the registered capital paid by Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu for the Equity Interests, or, in the event that applicable law requires an appraisal of the Equity Interests, the lowest price permitted under applicable law. Pursuant to powers of attorney executed by Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu, they irrevocably authorized any person appointed by CCM Network to exercise all shareholder rights, including but not limited to voting on their behalf on all matters requiring approval of E-Commerce Tianjin’s shareholder, disposing of all or part of the shareholder’s equity interest in E-Commerce Tianjin, and electing, appointing or removing directors and executive officers. The person designated by CCM Network is entitled to dispose of dividends and profits on the equity interest without reliance on any oral or written instructions of Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu. The powers of attorney will remain in force for so long as Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu remain the shareholders of E-Commerce Tianjin. Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu have waived all the rights which have been authorized to CCM Network’s designated person under the powers of attorney.
 Equity Pledge Agreement.



 Pursuant to the Equity Pledge Agreements, Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu pledged all of the Equity Interests to CCM Network to secure the full and complete performance of the obligations and liabilities on the part of E-Commerce Tianjin and them under this and the above contractual arrangements. If E-Commerce Tianjin, Mr. Zeyao Xue, or Mr. Kai Xu breaches their contractual obligations under these agreements, then CCM Network, as pledgee, will have the right to dispose of the pledged equity interests. Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu agree that, during the term of the Equity Pledge Agreements, they will not dispose of the pledged equity interests or create or allow any encumbrance on the pledged equity interests, and they also agree that CCM Network’s rights relating to the equity pledge should not be interfered with or impaired by the legal actions of the shareholders of E-Commerce Tianjin, their successors or designees. During the term of the equity pledge, CCM Network has the right to receive all of the dividends and profits distributed on the pledged equity. The Equity Pledge Agreements will terminate on the second anniversary of the date when E-Commerce Tianjin, Mr. Zeyao Xue and Mr. Kai Xu have completed all their obligations under the contractual agreements described above.
 Spousal Consent Letters. The spouse of Mr. Kai Xu (Mr. Zeyao Xue is not married), the shareholder of E-Commerce Tianjin has signed a spousal consent letter agreeing that the equity interests in E-Commerce Tianjin held by and registered under the name of such shareholder will be disposed pursuant to the contractual agreements with CCM Network. The spouse of such shareholder agreed not to assert any rights over the equity interest in E-Commerce Tianjin held by such shareholder.



 We are a holding company incorporated in Florida. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our subsidiaries and contractual arrangements with the VIE (E-Commerce Tianjin) based in China. The VIE is consolidated for accounting purposes but is not an entity in which we own equity. The VIE structure is subject to various risks. For example, the contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over E-Commerce Tianjin. We expect to rely on the performance by the VIE shareholders of their respective obligations under the contracts to exercise control over E-Commerce Tianjin. The VIE shareholders may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks will exist throughout the period in which we operate related e-commerce platform business through the contractual arrangements. If any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under these contracts through the operations of PRC law and arbitration, litigation or other legal proceedings which could be a lengthy process and very costly.



 Dividend Distribution and Cash Transfer Between the Holding Company, Subsidiary and VIE



 Our PRC operating entities receive a substantial part of our revenue in the RMB. Under our current corporate structure, to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, the Company may rely on dividend payments from its nine direct wholly-owned subsidiaries. CCM Network will receives payment from E-Commerce Tianjin when it starts to generate profits, pursuant to the VIE Agreements. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from State Administration of Foreign Exchange or the SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, our Chinese subsidiaries are able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends outside of the PRC complies with certain procedures under PRC foreign exchange regulation, such as the overseas investment registrations by our shareholders or the ultimate shareholders of our corporate shareholders who are PRC residents. Approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is, however, required where the RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. For the Company and our subsidiaries in Hong Kong, BVI, Japan, Cayman, UK, Dubai and U.S. (“Non-PRC Entities”), there is no restrictions on foreign exchange for such entities and they are able to transfer cash among these entities across borders. Also, there is no restrictions and limitations on the abilities of Non-PRC Entities to distribute earnings from their businesses, including from subsidiaries to the parent company or from the Company to the U.S. investors.

Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Company only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our subsidiaries in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Each such entity in China is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to be set aside, if any, is determined at the discretion of its board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. Under the existing laws of Hong Kong, funds from capital accounts can be repatriated and remitted overseas without restrictions, and there is no foreign exchange control imposed.



To the extent cash and/or assets in the business are in the PRC and/or Hong Kong or our PRC and/or Hong Kong entities, the VIE, and the WFOE, such funds and/or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries by the PRC government to transfer cash and/or assets. See “Risk Factor - We could be restricted from paying dividends to shareholders due to PRC laws and other contractual requirements.” and “Risk Factor - We could be restricted from paying dividends to shareholders due to PRC laws and other contractual requirements. To the extent cash and/or assets in the business are in the PRC and/or Hong Kong or our PRC and/or Hong Kong entities, the VIE, and the WFOE, such funds and/or assets may not be available to fund operations or for other use outside of the PRC and/or Hong Kong due to interventions in or the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the ability of us or our subsidiaries by the PRC government to transfer cash and/or assets.” We intend to keep any future earnings to re-invest in and finance the expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate that any cash dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. We currently don’t have any cash management policies and procedures in place that dictate how funds are transferred through our organization. Rather, the funds can be transferred in accordance with the applicable PRC laws and regulations. 



Cash dividends, if any, on our shares of common stock will be paid in U.S. dollars. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10.0%. Pursuant to the Arrangement between the Mainland of China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Tax Evasion With Respect to Taxes On Income, or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, the 10% withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5%, if the recipient of the relevant dividends qualifies certain necessary requirements, including without limitation that (a) the Hong Kong project must be the beneficial owner of the relevant dividends; and (b) the Hong Kong project must directly hold no less than 25% share ownership in the PRC project during the 12 consecutive months preceding its receipt of the dividends. The 5% withholding tax rate, however, does not automatically apply and in current practice, a Hong Kong project must obtain a tax resident certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority and enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under the Double Taxation Arrangement with respect to any dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to its immediate holding company, Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited. As of the date of this report, we have not applied for the tax resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority. Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited intends to apply for the tax resident certificate if and when its PRC subsidiaries plan to declare and pay dividends to Future FinTech (Hong Kong) Limited.

 Impact of COVID-19 on our Business



 In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was reported and has spread throughout China and other parts of the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a “pandemic”. In early 2020, Chinese government took emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in China. In response to the evolving dynamics related to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company is following the guidelines of local authorities as it prioritizes the health and safety of its employees, contractors, suppliers and business partners. Our offices in China were closed and the employees worked from home at the end of January until late March 2020 and was closed again in January 2022 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The quarantines, travel restrictions, and the temporary closure of office buildings have materially negatively impacted our business. Our suppliers were negatively affected, and could continue to be negatively affected in their ability to supply and ship products to our customers in case of any resurgence of COVID-19. Our customers that have been negatively impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19 may reduce their budgets to purchase products and services from us, which may materially adversely impact our revenue. The business operations of the third parties’ stores on our e-commerce platform have been and continue to be negatively impacted by the outbreak, which in turn adversely affects the business of our platform as a whole as well as our financial condition and operating results. The outbreak has had and continues to have disruption to our supply chain, logistics providers, customers or our marketing activities with the new variants of COVID-19, which could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations. Although China has already begun to recover from the outbreak of COVID-19, there are still outbreak in various cities and provinces due to new variants, including the recent outbreak of Omicron variant in Xi’an city, Hong Kong and Shanghai city in 2022 which have resulted quarantines, travel restrictions, and temporary closure of office buildings and facilities in these cities. The Company’s promotion strategy of CCM Shopping Mall previously mainly relied on the training of members and distributors through meetings and conferences. Chinese government still puts a restriction on large gatherings. These restrictions made the promotion strategy for our online e-commerce platforms difficult to implement and the Company has experienced difficulties to subscribe new members for its online e-commerce platforms. Due to the lack of new subscribers, in June 2021, the Company suspended its cross-border e-commerce platform NONOGIRL. Also, since the second quarter of 2021, the Company has transformed its member-based Chain Cloud Mall to a sale agent based eCAAS platform and began to provide supply chain financing services.



 The global economy has also been materially negatively affected by the COVID-19 and there is continued severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of its impacts. The Chinese and global growth forecast is extremely uncertain, which would seriously affect our business.



 While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of COVID-19 and its new variants may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 and its new variants could materially negatively affect our business and the value of our common stock. 



 Further, as we do not have access to a revolving credit facility, there can be no assurance that we would be able to secure commercial debt financing in the future in the event that we require additional capital. We currently believe that our financial resources will be adequate to see us through the outbreak. However, in the event that we do need to raise capital in the future, outbreak-related instability in the securities markets could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.



 Consequently, our results of operations have been materially and adversely affected by COVID-19 pandemic. Any potential further impact to our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19, new variants of COVID-19, the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 or treat its impact, almost all of which are beyond our control.



 Company Strategy and Principal Products and Services



 Our core business historically has been in the production and sale of fruit juice concentrates (including fruit purees and fruit juices), fruit beverages (including fruit juice beverages and fruit cider beverages) in the PRC and internationally. Due to drastically increased production cost and tightened environmental laws in China, the Company has transformed its main business from fruit juice manufacturing and distribution to a real-name blockchain e-commerce platform that integrates blockchain and internet technology in fiscal year 2019. The e-commerce platform contributed 93.7% to the total revenue for fiscal year 2020. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government put a restriction on large gatherings. These restrictions made the promotion strategy for our online e-commerce platforms difficult to implement and the Company has experienced difficulties to subscribe new members for its online e-commerce platforms. Due to the lack of new subscribers, since the second quarter of 2021, the Company has transformed its member-based business model of Chain Cloud Mall to a sale agent based eCAAS platform and began to provide supply chain financing services and trading of coal for coal mines and power generation plants as well as aluminum ingots. Also, the Company acquired 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of NTAM, a Hong Kong-based asset management company in August 2021. NTAM is licensed under the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong (“SFC”) to carry out regulated activities in Type 4: Advising on Securities and Type 9: Asset Management. During the fiscal year of 2021, the supply chain financing and wealth management business of NTAM contributed 78.75% and 21.22% of our revenues, respectively.

 On September 1, 2021, FTFT UK entered into a Share Purchase Agreement with Rahim Shah, a resident of United Kingdom (“Seller”) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares (the “Sale Shares”) of Khyber Money Exchange Ltd., which is a money transfer company with a platform for transferring money through one of its agent locations or via its online portal, mobile platform or over the phone. Khyber Money Exchange Ltd. is regulated by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the parties are waiting for the approval by the FCA before formal closing of the transaction.



 In December 2021, FTFT Capital Investments, LLC officially launched FTFTX, a cryptocurrency market data platform that provides investors with real-time cryptocurrency market data and trading information from a large number of cryptocurrency exchanges. The market data is available for Bitcoin, ETH, EOS, Litecoin, TRON and other cryptocurrencies at https://www.ftftx.com and via the FTFTX App on iOS and Android devices.

 In March 2022, FTFT UK FTFT UK received has received approval to operate as an Electronic Money Directive (“EMD”) Agent and has been registered as such with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a UK regulator. This status grants FTFT UK the ability to distribute or redeem e-money and provide certain financial services on behalf of an e-money institution (registration number 903050).



 The Company is in the process of transition and developing its financial technology related business, including asset management, supply chain financial services, digital banking and payment services, blockchain based e-commerce, and cryptocurrency market data services.



 Chain Cloud Mall (CCM)



 The trial operation of CCM started on December 26, 2018. On January 22, 2019, the Company formally launched Chain Cloud Mall, the real-name and membership-based blockchain shared shopping mall platform that integrates blockchain and internet technology. On June 1, 2019, CCM v2.0 was launched and on May 1, 2020, CCM v3.0 was launched. The blockchain technology enables CCM to record every event or transaction on a distributed ledger and makes the whole process traceable. It also enables the CCM to record and provide CCM points to its members upon a successful new member and/or product referral, which can be used as credit when making purchases on CCM. It incentivizes its members to promote the platform and share the products with their social contacts, which in turn increases the sales through CCM.



 Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese government put a restriction on large gatherings. These restrictions made the promotion strategy for our online e-commerce platforms difficult to implement and the Company has experienced difficulties to subscribe new members for its online e-commerce platforms. Due to the lack of new subscribers, since the second quarter of 2021, the Company has transformed its member-based business model of CCM to a sale agent based eCAAS platform.



 Currently, Chain Cloud Mall adopts an “Enterprise Communication as A Service” or eCAAS platform which is a part of 3.15 China Responsible Brand Program run by the Anti-Counterfeiting Committee of China Foundation of Consumer Protection (the “Anti-Counterfeiting Committee”). Anti-Counterfeiting Committee reviews and accepts the companies to join its 3.15 China Responsible Brand Program. After acceptance, these companies are authorized to use anti-counterfeiting labels on their products which have authenticated signatures of these companies and Anti-Counterfeiting Committee recorded on the blockchain quality and safety traceability system controlled by the Anti-Counterfeiting Committee. The companies will sell such products on our eCAAS platform. The companies can also use sales agents to sell their products on our eCAAS platform and parties can negotiate the commission percentages for the products sold. Any new sales agent must be recommended by existing agents and pay a one-time fee to the eCAAS platform to be admitted as the authorized agent to provide sales agent services on the platform.

 Asset Management Market in Hong Kong



 According to a report by Research Office Information Services Division Legislative Council Secretariat on April 30, 2021, asset management is an important pillar for Hong Kong as an international financial center. While Hong Kong serves as the gateway for overseas investors to invest in the mainland China, it also serves as the gateway for the mainland investors to invest in overseas markets at the same time. This has contributed to the rapid development of the asset management industry in Hong Kong. According to the latest available information, asset management accounted for 1.0% of Hong Kong’s Gross Domestic Product in 2017. As at end-2020, there were 1,914 companies licensed by or registered with the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) to carry out asset management business, representing an increase of 78% over 2014. Over the same period, the number of individuals licensed for asset management also grew from 7,729 to 13,074. The thriving development of the sector is also reflected in the rising trend in the revenue received by the industry. According to the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong, the business receipts index for the industry increased to 135 in 2020, representing an increase of 45% over 2014. According to a survey by SFC, Hong Kong’s asset management business amounted to HK$17.9 trillion (approximately US$2.29 trillion) as at end-2019. Within the industry, licensed corporations (e.g. fund houses) were the major market players, accounting for 87% of the total business. This was followed by registered institutions (i.e. banks engaging in asset management business) (7%) and insurance companies (6%).

 Since 2021, the performance of bulk commodities has been particularly strong. Affected by COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain disruption, economic recovery, monetary easing and the carbon emission control goal, the prices of bulk commodities have been rising, among which the price of coal has reached a new high in 2021. In this context, the active trading situation and market demand provide a good business environment for commodity supply chain enterprises.

On November 14, 2021, CAC published the Administration Measures for Cyber Data Security (Draft for Public Comments), or the “Cyber Data Security Measure (Draft)”, which requires cyberspace operators with personal information of more than 1 million users who want to list abroad to file a cybersecurity review with the Office of Cybersecurity Review. Our e-commerce platform currently is not a cyberspace operator with personal information of more than 1 million users or has activities that affect or may affect national security.



 Regulations Relating to E-Commerce



 In January 2014, State Administration for Market Regulation or SAMR (formerly known as State of Administration of Industry and Commerce) adopted the Administrative Measures for Online Trading, or the Online Trading Measures, which took effect in March 2014. Under the Online Trading Measures, e-commerce platform operators are required to examine, register and archive the identity information of the merchants applying for access to their platforms as sellers, and verify and update such information regularly. The Online Trading Measures also provide that e-commerce platform operators must make publicly available (i) the link to or the information contained in the business licenses of the merchants, in the case of business entities, or (ii) a label confirming the verified identity of the merchants, in the case of individuals. A consumer is entitled to return the commodities within seven days after receipt of the commodities without giving a reason, except for the following commodities: customized commodities, fresh and perishable commodities, audio-visual products downloaded online or unpackaged by consumers and computer software and other digital commodities, and newspapers and journals that have been delivered. E-commerce platform operators must, within seven days upon receipt of the returned commodities, provide full refunds to consumers. In addition, operators are prohibited from setting forth provisions in contracts or other terms that are not fair or reasonable to consumers such as those excluding or restraining consumers’ rights, relieving or exempting operators’ responsibilities, and increasing the consumers’ responsibilities, or conducting transactions in a forcible manner taking advantage of contractual terms or technical means.



 In March 2016, the State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, the Ministry of Finance, or the MOF, and the General Administration of Customs jointly issued the Circular on Tax Policy for Cross-Border E-Commerce Retail Imports, which took effect in April 2016. Pursuant to this circular, goods imported through the cross-border e-commerce retail are subject to tariff, import value-added tax, and consumption tax based on the types of goods. Individuals purchasing any goods imported through cross-border e-commerce retail are taxpayers, and e-commerce companies, companies operating e-commerce transaction platforms or logistic companies are required to withhold the taxes.



 On August 31, 2018, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress promulgated the E-Commerce Law, which became effective on January 1, 2019. The E-Commerce Law sets forth a series of requirements on e-commerce platform operators. According to the E-Commerce Law, e-commerce platform operators shall verify and register platform merchants, and cooperate with the market regulatory administrative department and tax administrative department to conduct industry and commerce registrations and tax registrations for merchants. The e-commerce platform operators shall also prepare a contingency plan for cybersecurity events and take technological measures and other measures to prevent online illegal and criminal activities. The E-Commerce Law also expressly requires platform operators to take necessary actions to ensure fair dealing on their platforms to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of consumers, including to prepare platform service agreements and transaction information record-keeping and transaction rules, to prominently display such documents on the platform’s website, and to keep such information for no fewer than three years following the completion of a transaction. To legally handle intellectual property infringement disputes, upon receipt of the notice specifying preliminary evidence for alleged infringement, the platform operators are required to take necessary measures in a timely manner, such as deleting, blocking and disconnecting the hyperlinks, terminating transactions and services, and forwarding notices to merchants on its platform. If an e-commerce platform operator fails to take necessary measures when it knows or should have known that a merchant on the platform infringes any third-party intellectual property rights, products or services provided by a merchant on its platform do not meet the requirements regarding personal or property safety, or any merchant otherwise impairs the lawful rights and interests of consumers, the e-commerce platform operator will be held jointly liable with the merchants on its platform.





18







 Moreover, the E-Commerce Law imposes a requirement on operators of e-commerce platforms to assist in tax collection with respect to income generated by sellers from transactions conducted on e-commerce platforms, including among others, submitting to the tax authority information on the identities of sellers on e-commerce platforms and other information relating to tax payment. Failure to comply with the requirement may result in operators of e-commerce platform being subject to fines and, in severe circumstances, suspension of business operations of e-commerce platforms. If the merchants on our platform were deemed to be selling our products on consignment basis, the PRC tax authorities may require our members to make tax registration and request our assistance in these efforts, pursuant to the new E-Commerce Law, and the merchants may be subject to more stringent tax compliance requirements. See “Risk Factors— Failure to comply with the relatively new E-Commerce Law may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.” According to the EIT Law, the VAT Law and other applicable regulations, sellers that conduct transactions on e-commerce platforms are generally subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%, and value-added tax at a rate of 13% or 9% for services or products sold on the e-commerce platforms. Certain sellers that are deemed as small taxpayers under PRC law are subject to reduced value-added tax at a rate of 3%.



 Value-Added Telecommunication Business Operating Licenses



 The PRC Telecommunications Regulations, or the Telecom Regulations, which were issued by the State Council in 2000 and were most recently amended in February 2016 are the primary governing law on telecommunication services. The Telecom Regulations set out the general framework for the provision of telecommunication services by PRC entities. Under the Telecom Regulations, telecommunications service providers are required to procure operating licenses prior to their commencement of operations. The Telecom Regulations draw a distinction between “basic telecommunications services” and “value-added telecommunications services.” A “Catalog of Telecommunications Business” was issued as an attachment to the Telecom Regulations to categorize telecommunications services as basic or value-added. In December 2015, MIIT released the Catalog of Telecommunication Business (2015 Revision), or the 2015 Telecom Catalog, implemented in March 2016. Under the 2015 Telecom Catalog, both the online data processing and transaction processing business (i.e., operating e-commerce business) and information service business, continue to be categorized as value-added telecommunication services.



 In March 2009, MIIT issued the Administrative Measures for Telecommunications Business Operating Permit, or the Telecom Permit Measures, which was implemented in 2009 and most recently amended in 2017. Pursuant to the Telecom Permit Measures, the operation scope of the value-added telecommunication business operating license, or VATS license, shall detail the permitted activities of the enterprise to which it is granted. An approved telecommunication services operator shall conduct its business in accordance with the specifications recorded on its VATS License. The VATS Licenses can be further categorized based on the specific business operations permitted to be carried out under such licenses, including among others, the VATS Licenses for internet information services, or the ICP License, and the VATS License for electronic data interchange business, or the EDI License. In addition, a VATS License holder is required to obtain approval from the original permit-issuing authority prior to any change to its shareholders, business scope or other information recorded on such license. In February 2015, the State Council issued the Decisions on Cancelling and Adjusting a Batch of Administrative Approval Items, which, among other things, replaced the pre-registration approval requirement for telecommunications businesses with a post-registration approval requirement.



 In September 2000, the State Council promulgated the Administrative Measures on Internet Information Services, or the Internet Measures, most recently amended in January 2011. Under the Internet Measures, “internet information services” refer to the provision of information through the internet to online users, and are divided into “commercial internet information services” and “non-commercial internet information services”. Commercial internet information services operators shall obtain an ICP License, from the relevant government authorities within China. E-commerce (Tianjin), the VIE, holds our VATS License for our Value-Added Telecommunication businesses.

 Regulations Relating to Internet Information Security and Privacy Protection



 Internet information in China is regulated from a national security standpoint. The National People’s Congress, or the NPC, enacted the Decisions on Preserving Internet Security in December 2000 and amended in August 2009, which subject violators to potential criminal punishment in China for any attempt to: (i) gain improper entry into a computer or system of strategic importance; (ii) disseminate politically disruptive information; (iii) leak state secrets; (iv) spread false commercial information; or (v) infringe intellectual property rights. The Ministry of Public Security of the PRC, or the MPS, promulgated the Administrative Measures for the Computer Information Network and Internet Security Protection in December 1998 and amended in January 2011, which prohibits use of the internet in ways which, among other things, result in a leak of state secrets or a spread of socially destabilizing content. If an internet information service provider violates these measures, the MPS and its local branches may issue a warning, confiscate the illegal gains, impose fines, and, in severe cases, advise competent authority to revoke its operating license or shut down its websites.



 Under the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, issued by the MIIT in December 2011 and implemented in March 2012, an internet information service provider may not collect any user personal information or provide any such information to third parties without the consent of the user. An internet information service provider must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of such user personal information and may only collect such information necessary for the provision of its services. An internet information service provider is also required to properly maintain the user’s personal information, and in case of any leak or likely leak of the user’s personal information, the internet information service provider must take immediate remedial measures and, in severe circumstances, immediately report to the telecommunications authority. Moreover, pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (the “SCNPC”) in August 2015 and implemented in November 2015, any internet service provider that fails to fulfill the obligations related to internet information security administration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify such failure upon orders, shall be subject to criminal penalty for the result of (i) any dissemination of illegal information in large scale; (ii) any severe effect due to the leakage of the client’s information; (iii) any serious loss of criminal evidence; or (iv) other severe situation. Any individual or entity that (i) sells or provides personal information to others in a way violating the applicable law, or (ii) steals or illegally obtains any personal information, shall be subject to criminal penalty in severe situation. In addition, the Interpretations of the Supreme People’s Court and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate of the PRC on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Infringing Personal Information, issued in May 2017 and implemented in June 2017, clarified certain standards for the conviction and sentencing of the criminals in relation to personal information infringement.



 In November 2016, the SCNPC promulgated the Cyber Security Law of the PRC, or the Cyber Security Law, which became effective on June 1, 2017. The Cyber Security Law requires that a network operator, which includes, among other things, internet information services providers, take technical measures and other necessary measures in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the compulsory requirements of the national and industrial standards to safeguard the safe and stable operation of its networks. We are subject to such requirements as we are operating websites and mobile applications and providing certain internet services mainly through our mobile applications. The Cyber Security Law further requires internet information service providers to formulate contingency plans for network security incidents, report to the competent departments immediately upon the occurrence of any incident endangering cyber security and take corresponding remedial measures.



 Internet information service providers are also required to maintain the integrity, confidentiality and availability of network data. The Cyber Security Law reaffirms the basic principles and requirements specified in other existing laws and regulations on personal data protection, such as the requirements on the collection, use, processing, storage and disclosure of personal data, and internet information service providers being required to take technical and other necessary measures to ensure the security of the personal information they have collected and prevent the personal information from being divulged, damaged or lost. Any violation of the Cyber Security Law may subject the internet information service provider to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of licenses, cancellation of filings, shutdown of websites or criminal liabilities.





20







 Furthermore, MIIT’s Rules on Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users promulgated in July 2013, effective September 2013, contain detailed requirements on the use and collection of personal information as well as security measures required to be taken by telecommunications business operators and internet information service providers.

 Fit and Proper Requirement



 Persons who apply for licenses under the HKSFO must satisfy and continue to satisfy after the grant of such licenses by the HKSFC that they are fit and proper persons to be so licensed. Generally, a fit and proper person means one who is financially sound, competent, honest, reputable, and reliable.

 Section 129(1) of the HKSFO sets out a number of matters that the HKSFC shall have regard to in assessing the fitness and properness of a person, an individual, corporation, or institution, which includes:

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reputation, character, reliability, and financial integrity of the applicant and other relevant persons as appropriate. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




 The above fit and proper criteria serve as the fundamental basis when the HKSFC considers each license or registration application. Detailed guidelines are contained in “the Fit and Proper Guidelines,” “the Licensing Information Booklet,” and “the Guidelines on Competence” published by the HKSFC.



 The Fit and Proper Guidelines apply to a number of persons including the following:

● | a licensed representative who applies for approval or is approved as a responsible officer under Part V of the HKSFO;

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




 Section 129(2) of the HKSFO empowers the HKSFC to take into consideration any of the following in considering whether a person is fit and proper:




● | decisions made by such relevant authorities as stated in section 129(2)(a) of the HKSFO or any other authority or regulatory organization, whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere, in respect of that person;

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | any information relating to any other person who will be acting for or on its behalf in relation to the regulated activity; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | whether the person has established effective internal control procedures and risk management systems to ensure its compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements under any of the relevant provisions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | the state of affairs of any other business which the person carries on or proposes to carry on. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




 The HKSFC is obliged to refuse an application to be licensed if the applicant fails to satisfy the HKSFC that the applicant is a fit and proper person to be licensed. The onus is on the applicant to make out a case that the applicant is fit and proper to be licensed for the regulated activity.
