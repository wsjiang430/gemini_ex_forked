ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Standard BioTools Inc. is driven by a bold purpose – unleashing tools to accelerate breakthroughs in human health. We develop, manufacture and sell technologies that help biomedical researchers in their search for developing medicines faster and better. Our tools provide insights in health and disease using our proprietary mass cytometry and microfluidics technologies, which serve applications in proteomics and genomics, respectively.
Within proteomics our mass cytometry technology is embodied in two analytical platforms: flow cytometry and tissue imaging or spatial biology. Our flow cytometry systems (Helios™ and CyTOF XT) deeply profile cell phenotype and function. Referenced by more than 2,200 peer-reviewed publications around the world, our CyTOF technology has set a new standard in human immune profiling with our proprietary digital readout. Our spatial biology systems (Hyperion™ Imaging System and Hyperion+TM Imaging System) enable highly multiplexed protein biomarker detection at a single cellular level in tissues and tumors while still preserving tissue architecture and cellular morphology information and without any autofluorescence artifacts by using our Imaging Mass Cytometry™ (IMC™) technology.
Within genomics, our microfluidics technology with our proprietary Integrated Fluidic Circuits (IFCs) provides high throughput and automated workflows for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gene expression, copy number variation analysis, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation. These automated systems are used to detect somatic and genomic variations from a range of different sample types which provide cost efficiencies, flexibility and proven analytical performance that customers need to meet the increasing demands of molecular biomarker analysis for diagnostics and research applications.
Strategic Investment Transaction 
On January 23, 2022, we entered into two transactions. First, we entered into (i) a Loan Agreement (the Casdin Loan Agreement) with Casdin Private Growth Equity Fund II, L.P. and Casdin Partners Master Fund, L.P.

Each Bridge Loan Agreement provided for a $12.5 million term loan to us.
Secondly, we entered into separate Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements (the Purchase Agreements), including subject to the approval of our stockholders that we issue and sell an aggregate of $225 million of convertible preferred stock, consisting of: (i) 112,500 shares of the Company’s Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series B-1 Preferred Stock), at a purchase price of $1,000 per share to Casdin; and (ii) 112,500 shares of the Company’s Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, and together with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock) at a purchase price of $1,000 per share to Viking (collectively, the Private Placement Issuance).
On April 1, 2022, our stockholders approved the closing of the Private Placement Issuance. On the closing date, April 4, 2022, we sold an aggregate of $225 million worth of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to Series B Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements. In addition, the Bridge Loans were automatically converted into shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock and Series B-2 Preferred Stock. The $250 million proceeds from the Bridge Loans and Private Placement Issuance are being used for working capital and general corporate purposes. On the closing date, the stockholders also approved the name change of our company to “Standard BioTools Inc.”
Strategy
Our new leadership team has identified three strategic priorities: revenue growth, improving operating discipline through the Standard BioTools Business Systems (SBS) and strategic capital allocation.
Revenue Growth
One of our top priorities is to grow our instrument, consumables and service revenue. We established new growth strategies for our product lines. We continue to invest in research and development (R&D) to create and launch new products and have adopted best practice approaches to improve our lead generation and funnel management growth, among other things.
Improving Operating Discipline Through SBS
Our second priority is to improve our operating discipline through the implementation of SBS. We are leveraging SBS with a set of organizing principles, rigorous standard work processes, and a continuous improvement mindset to build more efficient operations and commercial execution and reduce costs.
A phased restructuring plan, including a reduction in force, was substantially completed in 2022 to improve efficiency, reduce operating costs and better align our workforce with the current needs of our business. As part of the restructuring plan, the following actions have been taken:
•Reducing General and Administrative Expenses. We have significantly lowered general and administrative spend through a reduction in headcount and a decrease in office space in order to better align our spending with more streamlined operations. Specifically, we reduced our real estate footprint, including our headquarters location in South San Francisco while fostering remote work for certain employees. In August 2022, we entered into a 39-month term sublease agreement for approximately 25% of our corporate headquarters location that commenced in October 2022. We expect to recognize sublease rental income of $4.8 million over the lease term.
•Right Sizing Our Microfluidics Business. We have significantly reduced our expenses in microfluidics research and development and marketing while narrowing our commercial focus on high value niche markets for specialized applications. 
•Portfolio Rationalization. We discontinued certain products including Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), Flow Conductor, and COVID-19 diagnostic offerings.
We recognized $4.2 million in severance related restructuring expenses and $1.2 million of consulting and legal expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Based on actions taken to date, we realized operating expense reductions of approximately $5.5 million in 2022. See Note 16 Restructuring and Other Related Costs within our consolidated financial statements for further details. 
Strategic Capital Allocation
Our third priority is strategic capital allocation. We are actively pursuing business development opportunities in the life sciences industry with consolidation and synergies expected to be a key growth driver to sustain the longer-term value proposition of the Company.
Market Opportunity
We participate in growing and emerging market segments within the broader proteomics and genomics markets.
Proteomics
The market for Proteomics is broadly defined as instruments, consumables and reagents, software, and services for all technologies used in the identification of proteins. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, signaling response to stimuli and transporting molecules from one location to another. The proteome varies and is dynamic. Every cell in an individual organism has the same set of genes, but the set of proteins produced in different tissues differ from one another and are dependent on gene expression. Protein analysis is required to profile and understand cellular function as well as the interaction in tissues and other complex microenvironments. Within the Proteomics market, we focus on Flow Cytometry and Spatial Biology.
Flow Cytometry is a method to detect and measure physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles. With our CyTOF technology, we focus in a smaller sub-segment of Flow Cytometry for high-parameter analysis defined as greater than 20 parameters.
•Traditional flow cytometry utilizes a suspension of cells in a stream of fluid and passes them through an electronic detection apparatus to allow simultaneous multi-parameter analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics of up to thousands of cells per second. Although traditional flow cytometry technologies are high-throughput with single-cell analysis capabilities, a key limitation is the use of fluorescent dyes to label antibodies for detection. These fluorescent labels have emission spectra that typically overlap, making it challenging to optimize reagents to analyze many protein markers at once. In general, the number of protein targets for conventional flow cytometry is less than about 10 with significant reagent optimization often involved. 
•Our CyTOF technology is similar to traditional flow cytometry but is based primarily on antibodies using heavy metal isotope labels rather than fluorescent labels for detection of proteins, enabling the significant expansion of the number of parameters analyzed per individual cell versus conventional flow cytometry technologies, as well as providing superior data quality. With high-throughput, single-cell analysis capabilities and the ability to analyze more protein markers per individual cell, researchers have more granular information, which allows them to identify and characterize even finer subpopulations of cells. 
Spatial Biology, which itself is a sub-segment of the broader Tissue Image Analysis market that includes immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization, is the study of single cells in its spatial context to understand the role of heterogeneity in cell function and assess complex phenotypes and tumor-immune interactions in the tissue and tumor microenvironment.
•Immunohistochemistry is a method by which cells in a tissue section are stained with antibodies and then imaged with a conventional or fluorescent microscope. Antibodies selected to bind to proteins of interest can be conjugated with either chromogenic or fluorescent labels, allowing cellular proteins to be visualized in spatial context. Immunohistochemistry is used broadly throughout the life sciences industry, and in clinical research to better understand the characteristics and relationship of cancerous versus normal cells in biopsy tissue. In general, the number of simultaneously imageable proteins is less than five, with researchers only able to achieve a higher-parameter resolution using serial sections (several adjacent sections of the same tissue) or other highly laborious, more serial staining methods.
•Cyclic immunofluorescence is a method using an iterative process in which tissue slides are repeatedly stained and imaged with a fluorescent microscope, and then antibody stripping using denaturants. This method allows higher parameter analysis versus immunohistochemistry.
•Imaging mass cytometry is similar to immunohistochemistry but is based primarily on antibodies using heavy metal isotope labels rather than fluorescent or chromogenic labels for detection of proteins. This method enables a significant expansion of the number of parameters simultaneously analyzed per tissue section rather than in adjacent sections or via serial staining protocols. This method also eliminates issues of using fluorescent technology to image highly auto-fluorescent tissues.
Genomics
The market for genomics is broadly defined as instruments, consumables and reagents, software, and services for all technologies used in the identification of genes (DNA, RNA) and their function. The hereditary material or nucleic acid of an organism is often referred to as its genome, the protein-encoding regions of which are commonly known as genes. Analysis of variations in genomes, genes and gene activity in and between organisms can provide insights into their health and functioning.
Within the genomics market, we focus on two sub-segments: qPCR analysis and NGS library preparation.
There are several forms of genetic analysis in use today, including genotyping, gene expression analysis and NGS:
•Genotyping involves the analysis of DNA variations across individual genomes. There are multiple forms of variants, including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), insertion-deletions and copy number variation. A common application of genotyping focuses on analyzing SNPs to determine whether a SNP or group of SNPs are associated with a particular genetic trait, such as propensity for a disease. 
•Gene expression analysis involves measuring the levels of particular ribonucleic acid sequences known as messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which have been transcribed from genes. Determining these levels is important because mRNAs are often translated by the cell into proteins and may affect the activity of the cell or the larger organism.
•Gene expression and genotyping are studied through a combination of various technology platforms that characterize gene function and genetic variation. These platforms often rely on PCR amplification to generate exponential copies of a DNA sample to provide sufficient signal to facilitate detection. Real-time quantitative PCR (real-time qPCR) is a more advanced form of PCR that makes it possible to quantify the number of copies of DNA present in a sample.
•NGS is a process by which researchers are able to determine the particular order of nucleotide bases that comprise all or a portion of a particular gene or genome (in the case of DNA sequencing) or gene transcript or sample transcriptome (in the case of RNA sequencing). NGS is routinely used for studies across the research continuum including basic research, biomarker discovery, translational research, and clinical research. 
OEM Markets
We also utilize our proprietary microfluidics technology to collaborate with OEM providers to pursue market opportunities outside our core markets. These OEM markets are highly varied, and we believe represent significant expansion opportunities for our technology.

•We continued to deliver the Signature Q100 microfluidics platform to our OEM collaborator, Olink Holding AB.
Technology
Integrated Fluidic Circuits 
Our IFCs incorporate several different types of technology that together enable us to use multi-layer soft lithography (MSL) technology to rapidly design and deploy new microfluidic applications with state-of-the-art commercial manufacturing processes. The first level of our IFC technology is a library of components that perform basic microfluidic functions, such as pumps, mixers, single-cell capture chambers, separation columns, control logic, and reaction chambers. The second level of our IFC technology comprises the architectures we have designed to exploit our ability to conduct thousands of reactions on a single IFC. The third level of our IFC technology involves the interaction of our IFCs with the actual laboratory environment. 
Instrumentation and Software
Our mass cytometry instrumentation technology includes a custom-designed inductively coupled plasma ion source, ion-optical and vacuum systems, and instrument control electronics. With our CyTOF systems, individual cells are atomized, ionized, and extracted. A time-of-flight mass analyzer separates atomic ions of different mass-to-charge ratios, providing information on temporal distribution of ions. Our Imaging Mass Cytometry systems combine mass cytometry technology with imaging capability to enable simultaneous interrogation of up to 50 protein markers in the spatial context of the tissue microenvironment. Our systems have the ability to utilize up to 135 channels to detect additional parameters to meet future market needs.
Our microfluidics-based X9 Real-Time PCR system includes our custom thermal cycler, a sophisticated fluorescence imaging system, and on-board scripting and protocol control software, and utilizes our IFC technology for a wide range automated genomics applications.
We also offer specialized software to manage and analyze the unusually large amounts of data produced by our systems. We offer Cytobank, our cloud-based platform of analytical tools, FCS Express7 Flow, and Maxpar Pathsetter data analysis packages for use with the CyTOF systems. For our Imaging Mass Cytometry platform, Hyperion, we offer various state of the art software packages to enable data analysis from basic to translational research: CyTOF Software 7.0, MCD Viewer, histoCAT, Visiopharm Phenomap and Indica Lab Halo. Our bioinformatic toolset, the Singular software, facilitates the analysis and visualization of single-cell gene expression data. More recently, we extended the scope of the toolset to include DNA analysis tools. 
Assays and Reagents
We manufacture over 800 metal-conjugated antibodies for use with our mass cytometry and Imaging Mass Cytometry instruments to allow detection of up to 48 protein targets simultaneously in a single cell for a total of more than 50 detected cellular parameters. Our metal-conjugated antibodies are manufactured using metal-chelating polymers, which are produced using proprietary polymerization processes and subsequent post-polymerization modifications.
Our genotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism type (SNP Type) assay products consist of assay design and custom content delivery systems for gene expression and genotyping, respectively. These offerings provide low-cost alternatives to other available chemistries and allow customers to use IFCs in more flexible ways with validated assays for their targets of interest
Customers
We sell our instruments and consumables for research use only to leading academic research institutions, translational research and medicine centers, cancer centers, clinical research laboratories, and biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, and plant and animal research companies. One customer accounted for 11% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. No single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for 2021.
Marketing, Sales, Service and Support 
We distribute our systems through our direct sales force and support organizations located in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, and through distributors or sales agents in European, Latin American, Middle Eastern, and Asia-Pacific countries. Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at laboratory directors and principal investigators at leading academic, translational research, healthcare consortiums, and biopharmaceutical companies who need reliable life science automation solutions to power their disease research with the goal of providing actionable insights. 
Our sales process often involves numerous interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the system, including running experiments on our system and competing systems. In addition, in most countries, sales to academic or governmental institutions require participation in a tender process involving preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors and the budget cycles of our customers, our sales cycle, the time from initial contact with a customer to our receipt of a purchase order, can often be 12 months or longer.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing operations are located in Singapore and Canada. Our facility in Singapore manufactures IFCs and assemblies of microfluidics instruments. In 2022, assembly of microfluidics instruments was insourced to our Singapore facility to reduce cost and improve product quality. All of our IFCs for commercial sale and some IFCs for our research and development purposes are also fabricated at our Singapore facility. Our mass cytometry instruments and reagents for commercial sale, as well as for internal research and development purposes, are manufactured at our facility in Canada. Our genomics reagent manufacturing was transferred from South San Francisco to Markham, Canada in late 2022.
We rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain components and materials used in our products. Key components in our products that are supplied by sole or limited source suppliers. The loss of a single or sole source supplier would require significant time and effort to locate and qualify an alternative source of supply, if at all, and could adversely impact our business. For additional information, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Research and Development
We have assembled experienced research and development teams at our South San Francisco, California, Markham, Ontario, Canada, and Singapore locations and have the scientific, engineering, software, bioinformatic, and process talent that we believe is required to grow our business.
The largest components of our current research and development efforts are in the areas of new products, new applications and new content. We launched our Hyperion Imaging System in October 2017. The Hyperion Imaging System provides spatial resolution of protein expression in complex tissue samples at the single-cell level, quantitative measurement using metal isotope tags, and analysis of up to 40 proteins, while having 135 channels available. We also developed metal-labeled antibodies compatible with formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue samples, to be used with the Hyperion Imaging System. In 2022 we launched the Hyperion+ Imaging System, our second-generation imaging platform.
In 2019, we launched the Maxpar Direct Immune Profiling Assay, a sample-to-answer workflow for comprehensive human immune profiling for use with our CyTOF systems, which puts pre-titrated antibodies in dry format in a single tube, with automated software that provides data analysis in as few as five minutes. This assay is reproducible from site-to-site and lot-to-lot, which is important for translational and pharma/biotech research work. We have collaborated with industry partners to enable workflows and software for the Hyperion and CyTOF systems. Also in 2019, we added seven new metal antibody labels, becoming the first company to enable 50-plex cytometry panels, and launched three Imaging Mass Cytometry panel kits as well as CyTOF Software v7.0, an updated CyTOF software application.
In May 2021, we launched the new, fourth generation cell suspension mass cytometry system, CyTOF XT. Its main features include automation of sample introduction and acquisition, and lower cost of ownership and enhanced performance in resolution of cell populations. The system enables storage of pelleted samples in the cooled autosampler, automated resuspension of pellets, and addition of beads standards.
We also invest significantly in research and development efforts to expand our microfluidics applications. For example, we continue to develop and commercialize various panel sets for use with our systems. In 2017, we successfully launched the Advanta™ Immuno-Oncology Gene Expression Assay, which is a 170-gene expression qPCR assay that enables profiling of tumor immunobiology and new biomarker identification. In 2019, we launched the Advanta™ RNA-Seq NGS Library Prep Kit. Designed to drive significant improvement in the RNA-seq workflow, the Advanta RNA-Seq NGS Library Prep Kit together with the Juno™ system delivers an integrated solution for automated, cost-efficient NGS library prep. In 2020, we expanded our microfluidics franchise to develop products for the COVID-19 testing marketplace and we launched the AdvantaDx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. These COVID-19 related products were discontinued in 2022. 
In 2022, we launched the X9 Real Time PCR System: a next-generation system platform that integrates all the features of all our legacy platforms into one ultra-compact footprint with a simple-to-operate user interface. In addition, we secured significant development collaborations, including for development of OEM systems using our microfluidics technology. 
The second component of our research and development effort is to continuously develop new manufacturing processes and test methods to drive down manufacturing costs, increase manufacturing throughput, widen fabrication process capability, and support new microfluidic devices and designs.
Competition
The life science markets are highly competitive and expected to grow more competitive with the increasing knowledge gained from ongoing research and development. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our target markets include quality of product, cost of capital equipment and supplies; reputation among customers; innovation in product offerings; flexibility and ease of use; accuracy and reproducibility of results; competition for human resources; and compatibility with existing laboratory processes, tools, and methods.
We compete with both established and development stage life science companies that design, manufacture, and market instruments for gene expression analysis, genotyping, other nucleic acid detection, protein expression analysis, imaging, and additional applications. In addition, a number of other companies and academic groups are in the process of developing novel technologies for life science markets. Many of our competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including significantly greater name recognition; greater financial and human resources; broader product lines and product packages; larger sales forces and e-commerce channels; larger and more geographically dispersed customer support organizations; substantial intellectual property portfolios; larger and more established customer bases and relationships; greater resources dedicated to marketing efforts; better established and larger scale manufacturing capability; and greater resources and longer experience in research and development. For additional information, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
To successfully compete with existing products and future technologies, we need to demonstrate to potential customers that the performance of our technologies and products, the solutions we provide our customers, as well as our customer support capabilities, are superior to those of our competitors.

Not for use in diagnostic procedures.”
In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance document stating that merely including a labeling statement that the product is for research purposes only will not necessarily render the device exempt from the FDA’s clearance, approval, or other regulatory requirements if the totality of circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate that the manufacturer knows its product is being used by customers for diagnostic uses or the manufacturer intends such a use. These circumstances may include, among other things, written or verbal marketing claims regarding a product’s performance in clinical diagnostic applications and a manufacturer’s provision of technical support for such activities. In the future, certain of our products or related applications could become subject to regulation as medical devices by the FDA. If we are required to submit our products for pre-market review by the FDA, we may be required to delay marketing and commercialization while we obtain pre-market clearance or approval from the FDA. There would be no assurance that we could ever obtain such clearance or approval.
In some cases, our customers may use our RUO products in their own laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) or in other FDA-regulated products for clinical diagnostic use. The FDA has historically exercised enforcement discretion in not enforcing the medical device regulations against LDTs and LDT manufacturers. However, on October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents that set forth the FDA’s proposed risk-based framework for regulating LDTs, which are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. In January 2017, the FDA announced that it would not issue final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers but would seek further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach and give Congress an opportunity to develop a legislative solution. More recently, the FDA has issued warning letters to genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications, noting that the FDA has not created a legal “carve-out” for LDTs and retains discretion to take action when appropriate, such as when certain genomic tests raise significant public health concerns. As laboratories and manufacturers develop more complex genetic tests and diagnostic software, the FDA may increase its regulation of LDTs. Any future legislative or administrative rule making or oversight of LDTs and LDT manufacturers if and when finalized, may impact the sales of our products and how customers use our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws.
In February 2022, we were granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for our the Advanta Dx COVID-19 EASE Assay, which was authorized for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, mid-turbinate nasal swab, and anterior nasal swab specimens from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Subsequently, in February 2023, the FDA granted our request to withdraw the EUA for our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay. We submitted our request to withdraw such EUA as we had discontinued commercial distribution of the product. 
Other U.S. Healthcare Regulatory Requirements
Medical device companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to interactions and financial arrangements with healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations, payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers, among others. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of applicable laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment. Changes in healthcare regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could also impact our business in the future, expose use to increased liabilities, and increase the costs of our operations. 
Environmental Matters
We are subject to many federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations. To comply with applicable regulations, we have and will continue to incur significant expenses and allocate internal resources to manage compliance-related issues. In addition, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand or equip our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with the regulations. For example, the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (RoHS), the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE), enacted in the European Union, regulate the use of certain hazardous substances, notification of customers of the presence of any substances of very high concern in products, and require the collection, reuse, and recycling of waste from, products we manufacture. Certain products sold in these countries are subject to RoHS, REACH and WEEE requirements. If we fail to comply with any present and future regulations, we could be subject to future fines, 
penalties, and restrictions, such as the suspension of manufacturing of our products or a prohibition on the sale of products we manufacture. For additional information, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Our research and development and manufacturing processes also involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including flammables, toxics, corrosives, and biologics. Our research and manufacturing operations produce hazardous biological and chemical waste products. We seek to comply with applicable laws regarding the handling and disposal of such materials. The volume of such materials used or generated at our facilities is small. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. We do not currently maintain separate environmental liability coverage and any such contamination or discharge could result in significant cost to us in penalties, damages, and suspension of our operations.
Geographic Area Information
During the last two years, a significant portion of our revenue was generated outside of the United States. Total revenue received from customers outside the United States was $56.9 million, or 58% of our total revenue, in 2022, compared to $70.4 million, or 54% of our total revenue, in 2021. The majority of our long-lived assets are located within the United States, Singapore and Canada. Refer to Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding geographic areas. 
Seasonality
Our fourth quarter revenues are often the highest, primarily due to seasonality since many of our customers tend to spend budgeted money before the end of their calendar fiscal year-end. Our revenue in the first quarter is generally sequentially lower than the prior year’s revenue in the fourth quarter.
Raw Materials 
Certain raw materials used in our Delta Gene and SNP Type assays and Access Array target-specific primers are available from a limited number of sources. Additionally, certain metals used in our Maxpar reagents are available from a sole source. Currently, we do not have supply agreements with these suppliers. While we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect our supply chain.
Backlog
We manufacture products based on forecasts of our customers’ demand and advance non-binding commitments from customers as to future purchases. Our customers generally do not place purchase orders far in advance. A substantial portion of our products are sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancellable prior to shipment without penalty. Accordingly, backlog at any given time is not a meaningful indicator of future sales.
