ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



Bluejay Diagnostics, Inc. (“Bluejay”) is a medical diagnostics company developing rapid tests using whole blood on our Symphony technology platform (“Symphony”) to improve patient outcomes in critical care settings. Our Symphony platform is a combination of Bluejay’s intellectual property (“IP”) and exclusively licensed and patented IP that consists of a mobile device and single-use test cartridges that if cleared, authorized, or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), can provide a solution to a significant market need in the United States. Clinical trials indicate the Symphony device produces laboratory-quality results in less than 20 minutes in critical care settings, including Intensive Care Units (“ICUs”) and Emergency Rooms (“ERs”), where rapid and reliable results are required.



Our first product, the Symphony IL-6 test, is for the monitoring of disease progression in critical care settings. IL-6 is a clinically established inflammatory biomarker, and is considered a ‘first-responder,’ for assessment of severity of infection and inflammation across many disease indications, including sepsis. A current challenge of healthcare professionals is the excessive time and cost associated determining a patient’s level of severity at triage and our Symphony IL-6 test has the ability to consistently monitor this critical care biomarker with rapid results.



In the future we plan to develop additional tests for Symphony including two cardiac biomarkers (hsTNT and NT pro-BNP) as well as other tests using the Symphony platform. We do not yet have regulatory clearance for our Symphony products, and our Symphony products will need to receive regulatory authorization from the FDA in order to be marketed as a diagnostic product in the United States.



Our operations to date have been funded primarily through the proceeds of our initial public offering (the “IPO”) on November 2021 (the “IPO Date”). We were incorporated under the laws of Delaware on March 20, 2015. Our headquarters is located in Acton, Massachusetts.



Our Market



The Symphony platform and our initial biomarker test, Symphony IL-6 test, is well suited to address a subset of the global in vitro diagnostics devices (“IVDs”) market, including sepsis, cardio-metabolic diseases, cancer and other diseases that require rapid tests. Symphony targets critical care markets where physicians must quickly determine patient acuity to identify optimal treatment regimens.
Our Business Model



Our goal is to become the first provider of rapid tests for infectious, inflammatory and metabolic diseases by leveraging the strengths of our Symphony platform. We intend to target our sales and marketing of Symphony to the largest critical care facilities in the United States. Our business model includes the following:

● | Attractive Financing Model. We intend to offer various financing options for the device itself. As such, our business model should not require customers to incur a significant capital outlay.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Recurring Revenue. We intend to sell single-use diagnostic test cartridges. Our cartridges will create a growing and recurring revenue stream, as adoption and utilization increase, and as we develop tests for additional indications. We expect the sale of test cartridges to generate the majority of our revenue and gross profit.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our Menu of Diagnostic Products. As adoption increases, the average customer use of the Symphony platform should also increase. As we expand our test menu, we will be able to increase our annual revenue per customer through the resulting increase in utilization.

The Symphony Platform



The Symphony platform is an innovative and proprietary technology platform that provides rapid and accurate measurements of key diagnostic biomarkers found in whole blood. Symphony is compact and can be deployed mobile as compared to current laboratory diagnostic platforms. Symphony incorporates a user-friendly interface where all sample preparation and reagents are integrated into disposable Symphony cartridges. Symphony only requires a few drops of blood to provide a measurement in less than 20 minutes.



The Symphony analyzer orchestrates whole blood processing, biomarker isolation, and immunoassay preparation using non-contact centrifugal force. All necessary reagents and components are integrated into the Symphony cartridges. Utilizing precision microchannel technology and high specificity antibodies, whole blood is processed, and the biomarker is isolated within the Symphony cartridge. Intermitted centrifugation cycles enable complex fluid movements, allowing sequential reagent additions and independent reaction steps inside the hermitically sealed Symphony cartridge. At the conclusion of the test, the Symphony analyzer measures the fluorescence signature correlating to a highly sensitive quantitation of the biomarker. 



To perform a Symphony test, the test operator adds three drops of blood to the Symphony cartridge. After scanning in the patient ID, the Symphony cartridge is inserted into the Symphony analyzer and the test runs automatically. Each analyzer can run up to six cartridges simultaneously, either with six different patient samples or six different tests, in less than 20 minutes, providing quantitative measurements used for improved patient management and clinical decision-making.



Manufacturing



We plan to manufacture both our devices and cartridges through Contract Manufacturing Organizations (“CMOs”). We have contracts with Toray Industries, Inc (“Toray”) to manufacture our cartridges and Sanyoseiko Co. Ltd (“Sanyoseiko”) to manufacture both our device and cartridges. Each of our partners are well-established global manufacturing companies with capabilities to scale up, re-design and supply our devices and cartridges.



Sanyoseiko had been selected as our CMO, though in the near-term Toray will continue to develop, validate and manufacture our IL-6 cartridges as our pilot-manufacturing partner. We expect to meet the demands of our global market. Both Toray’s and Sanyoseiko’s facilities are located in Japan. We license the technology for the Symphony cartridges from Toray. Our license grants us exclusive global use with the exception of Japan.



Regulatory Strategy



Our current regulatory strategy is designed to support commercialization of Symphony in the United States pending authorization from the FDA. The FDA has identified Symphony as a de novo device, and we are subject to the de novo authorization regulatory pathway, which includes expansion of our clinical studies. We have several clinical studies currently active, all designed to support our de novo FDA submission. We have targeted large, well-known medical and academic institutions for our studies, which should also help support initial commercialization and market penetration. This clinical trial expansion could also support additional indications. The expansion also could delay obtaining marketing authorization for the product.
Sales and Marketing



Until Symphony products are authorized by the FDA, we will focus our sales and marketing efforts on brand awareness and market education to potential customers, emphasizing the value of monitoring a critical care patient’s IL-6 levels to improve decision making and patient outcomes. If cleared or approved by the FDA, we will target sales to ERs and ICUs at United States hospitals, as well as to long-term acute care facilities. We plan to establish a market presence by selling Symphony devices and tests both directly and through various distribution channels to maximize sales volume and market penetration.

License Agreement



On October 6, 2020, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement, as amended, (the “License Agreement”) with Toray, providing us with an exclusive global license with Toray, excluding Japan, to use their patents and know-how related to the Symphony detection cartridges for the manufacturing, marketing and sale of the products (as defined in the License Agreement). We also have a nonexclusive license for the same purposes in Japan. The agreement terminates in 2029 upon expiration of the last of the patents included in the license.



In connection with entering into the License Agreement, we are required to pay a 15% royalty fee for the period that any underlying patents exist or for five years after the first sale for the licensed technology after obtaining regulatory approval based on a percentage of our “Net Sales” of products using these technologies (as defined in the license Agreement) with a minimum royalty of $60,000 for the initial year that royalties are payable increasing to a minimum of $100,000 thereafter.



Intellectual Property, Proprietary Technology



We do not currently hold any patents directly. We rely on a combination either directly or through the License Agreement with Toray of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, confidentiality agreements, and contractual protection to establish and protect our proprietary rights.
Competition



Our primary competition in the IL-6 market is laboratory size equipment including the Roche Cobas®, Siemens ADVIA Centaur® and Beckman Coulter Access 2®, which require pre-processing of whole blood prior to performing their test. We believe that our technology, which uses whole blood, provides us with a substantial competitive advantage over our existing competition that will sustain through commercialization, despite the major life science companies and consistent entry of innovative start-ups that define our competitive landscape.
Government Regulation



The design, development, manufacture, testing and sale of our products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA, and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies.



FDA Regulation



Medical Devices



Generally, the products we develop must be cleared by the FDA before they are marketed in the United States. Before and after approval, authorization, or clearance in the United States, our products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, as well as by other regulatory bodies. FDA regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, storage, recordkeeping, market clearance, authorization or approval, advertising and promotion, import and export, marketing and sales, and distribution of medical devices, including IVDs. IVDs are a type of medical device and include reagents and instruments used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases, conditions or infections, including, without limitation, the presence of certain chemicals or other biomarkers. Predictive, prognostic and screening tests can also be IVDs.

In the United States, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the extent of controls the FDA determines are necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness:




● | Class I: general controls, such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class II: special controls, premarket notification (often referred to as a 510(k)), specific controls such as performance standards, patient registries, post-market surveillance, additional controls such as labeling and adherence to quality system regulations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III: special controls and requires a premarket approval (“PMA”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements



Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, approval of a de novo application, or approval of a premarket approval (PMA).



While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. Our initial product is a Class II device subject to 510(k) clearance.



510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway 



To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but often takes longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, the FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments.



After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.

De Novo Classification



Devices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified based on risk are automatically classified into Class III by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FDCA, regardless of the level of risk they pose. To avoid requiring PMA review of low- to moderate-risk devices classified in Class III by operation of law, Congress enacted section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA. This provision allows FDA to classify a low- to moderate-risk device not previously classified into Class I or II. After de novo authorization, an authorized device may be used as a predicate for future devices going through the 510(k) process.



The FDA has classified Symphony as de novo, a device of a new type that the FDA has not previously classified. Once obtained, a de novo authorization may lead to Symphony’s use as a predicate for future devices going through the 510(k) process.



Clinical Trials 



Clinical trials are often required for a de novo authorization. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.



In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE study and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.



During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, we, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.



Sponsors of applicable clinical trials of devices also are required to register with www.clinicaltrials.gov, a public database of clinical trial information. Information related to the device, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Although the QSR does not fully apply to investigational devices, the requirement for controls on design and development does apply.

Post-market Regulation 



After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:




● | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of ‘‘off-label’’ uses of cleared or approved products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | requirements related to promotional activities; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Once we have a commercialized product, our manufacturing processes will be required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.



The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:




● | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusing or delaying our requests for regulatory approvals or clearances of new products or modified products; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | withdrawing a PMA that has already been granted; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal to grant export approval for our products; or 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | criminal prosecution 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------
