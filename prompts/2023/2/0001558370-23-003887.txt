Analysis for Life
We are leading a revolution in measurement devices for chemical and biochemical analysis with our simple handheld and desktop devices, addressing critical-to-life applications. We are reimagining where Mass Spec technology can be used if it is sufficiently small in size, low in cost, and simple to operate.
Company Overview
We have developed an innovative suite of purpose-built handheld and desktop mass spectrometry, or Mass Spec, devices for the point-of-need. Leveraging our proprietary platform technology, we make the extraordinary analytical power of Mass Spec available in devices that are significantly smaller and more accessible than conventional laboratory instruments. Our Mass Spec devices are used at the point-of-need to interrogate unknown and invisible materials and provide quick, actionable answers to directly address some of the most critical problems in life sciences research, bioprocessing, quality assurance/quality control, forensics and adjacent markets.
We create simplified measurement devices that our customers can use as accurate tools where-and-when their work needs to be done, rather than overly complex and centralized analytical instrumentation. We believe the insights and answers our devices provide will accelerate workflows, reduce costs, and offer transformational opportunities for our end users.

Since the launch of our first device, we have sold more than 2,300 handheld and desktop devices to over 550 customers in over 45 countries, including all 20 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies by revenue, as well as numerous domestic and foreign government agencies and leading academic institutions.
Our current products are available for both battery powered handheld and desktop applications, including our flagship devices -- MX908 and Rebel.

​
Front-line workers rely upon our handheld devices to combat the opioid crisis and detect counterfeit pharmaceuticals and illicit materials in the air or on surfaces at levels 1,000 times below their lethal dose. Our desktop devices are accelerating development and production of biotherapeutics by identifying and quantifying extracellular species in bioprocessing critical to cell health and productivity. They sit either alongside or connected to bioreactors and fermenters producing drug candidates, functional proteins, cell and gene therapies, and synthetic biology-derived products. We believe the insights and answers our devices provide accelerate workflows, reduce costs, and offer transformational opportunities for our end users.
Mass Spec is the gold-standard analytical technology for laboratory-based molecular analysis and can identify and quantify sample components via molecular weight measurements. Mass Spec is highly regarded for its ability to provide an extraordinarily detailed analysis of a wide variety of samples -- from small molecules to large complex proteins. While Mass Spec is an extremely powerful analytical tool, conventional Mass Spec instruments are very large, expensive, and highly complex, which has profoundly bottlenecked market opportunities and relegated them to the equivalent of mainframe computers in central facilities. We are seeking to reimagine where Mass Spec technology can be used if it is sufficiently small in size, low in cost, and simple to operate.
Our proprietary Mass Spec platform relies on extreme miniaturization of the core of Mass Spec -- the ion trap and its vacuum system. Using semiconductor microfabrication techniques, we design and produce components that are more than a thousand fold smaller in volume when compared with most laboratory Mass Spec instruments and costs only dollars to manufacture. The vacuum system alone in a typical laboratory instrument weighs hundreds of pounds and requires several hundred watts of power, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Our miniaturized vacuum system weighs less than a pound, and our Mass Spec in total requires less power than a 20-watt LED light bulb. These landmark proprietary advances have enabled the first truly handheld Mass Spec devices and compact desktops.
Sample preparation and separation can be a painfully slow hours-long process, and we have invested heavily in the development of microfluidic sample preparation and microscale separation technologies to reduce preparation and separation time from hours to minutes. The size of a business card, our microfluidic capillary-electrophoresis, or CE, chip has demonstrated world-class performance and speed in separating everything from small molecules such as metabolites and drugs, to biopharmaceutical proteins, antibodies, and oligonucleotides.

With our acquisition of TRACE Analytics GmbH (“Trace”) in August 2022, we obtained microfluidic aseptic sampling technology that enables on-line automated monitoring and control in bioprocess applications. This validated technology provides cell-free and sterile bioreactor sampling with no volume or prep required. We expect this technology to serve as the interface for future on-line devices, those directly connected to a bioreactor.
Lastly, it is imperative that a point-of-need solution is operable by the widest possible user base. We have an industry-leading software automation and machine learning team comprised of nine members, each with advanced scientific degrees, who have collective experience working on 30 commercial product launches and have won numerous research and innovation awards. They have applied advanced software automation and machine learning techniques to both control the hardware in our devices and interpret the incredibly rich and complex data streaming off of them. It is common for expert data interpretation from a laboratory Mass Spec instrument to take hours or days -- we can provide answers immediately to maximize value to the customer in critical-to-life applications where minutes matter.
We fundamentally believe that the technology platform we have built and the investments we are making will allow people to answer chemical and biochemical questions in times and places that were previously inconceivable. Given the market opportunity, we expect to face substantial competition from large established manufacturers of Mass Spec laboratory-based instruments and from new entrants; however, our proprietary advances have enabled us to manufacture the first truly handheld Mass Spec devices and compact desktops and we believe we are well-positioned to face future competition.
As we democratize the extraordinary power of Mass Spec, we believe our technology platform can expand in future opportunities far beyond the conventional central laboratory market for Mass Spec and associated front-end separations. We estimate our total addressable market, or TAM, for our devices was $5.7 billion in 2022 and is growing to an estimated $27 billion by 2027. The TAM for our handhelds was estimated to be $1.3 billion in 2022 with expansion to over $3.9 billion with software application extensions for GxP cleaning validation, and other related quality control assays. Our desktop devices supporting bioprocess development represented an estimated TAM of $0.8 billion in 2022 expanding significantly to approximately $15 billion with execution of our roadmap and the rapid growth of cell therapy. We see additional opportunity to address the estimated $3.6 billion in 2022 across the research chromatography market space growing to more than $8.1 billion with further market growth and roadmap expansion into complex metabolomics and proteomics. Our estimates of our TAM are based on potential customer research and development spending, addressable aspects of potential customers’ end product development process, and potential platform usage. We also utilize estimated penetration and placement rates for our platform with potential customers in our target markets and historical patterns for consumables usage.
Our Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths provide us the ability to address point-of-need applications in forensics, life sciences research, bioprocessing, quality assurance/quality control, and synthetic biology:

● | Our proprietary microscale Mass Spec platform leverages well established, gold-standard technology. Mass Spec is already ubiquitous in the laboratory. Users do not need to take a risk on a completely unknown technology. We bring laboratory-grade capability to handhelds and desktops. We have developed a proprietary Mass Spec platform and approach that allow us to move the capabilities of conventional Mass Spec beyond the central laboratory. Our proprietary High-Pressure Mass Spec, or HPMS, technology enables us to produce significantly smaller, purpose-built Mass Spec devices that are much more ideal for use in point-of-need settings, in contrast to conventional mainframe Mass Spec solutions. The combination of HPMS, our proprietary microfluidic sampling and separation technology, and our data analytics, and machine-learning technology provides the foundations of an adaptable platform that can serve a growing number of new and adjacent applications and markets.

impossible for conventional Mass Spec manufacturers. Our products are small, purpose-built devices that avoid the typical size and complexity issues related to conventional Mass Spec while also offering real-time, actionable answers to new classes of users. As we continue to expand the capabilities of our Mass Spec platform, we believe our devices will continue to penetrate new and adjacent opportunities in life sciences, quality assurance and control, diagnostics and applied markets.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly attractive business model validated by rapidly growing installed base of devices.We have over 550 customers, including all 20 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies by revenue, academic and major government institutions, including the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps and other international, federal and state agencies. These customers have validated our platform through the collective purchase of more than 2,300 devices, with more than 9,000 users trained on our devices. As we continue to grow our installed base, we expect to increase our recurring revenue derived from the sale of consumables and support services.

Our Growth Strategy
We are pursuing the democratization of the gold-standard molecular analysis laboratory technique: Mass Spec. Just as mainframe computers transitioned to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, we are leading a transformation of the Mass Spec market. Our growth strategy includes the following key elements:

● | A continued focus on simplicity, speed, convenience and cost increases measurement consumption. We are a technology-driven company with significant core expertise in engineering, hard sciences and data analytics and a proven track record of delivering products that delight our customers by making things easy. We believe a relentless focus on these fundamentals drives consumption of consumables. We further believe broadscale democratization of Mass Spec is enabled by our progress on these same fundamentals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drive enterprise adoption in our seeded accounts. We intend to continue to aggressively invest in and support our field applications team to accelerate the development of post-sale partnerships with customers and to drive broader adoption across the organization. We will focus on building upon our track record of leveraging our customers’ success in trials and pilots into enterprise-wide adoption of both devices and consumables. As an example, for our handheld device, it is typical for government organizations to conduct a one week or longer trial prior to purchase to test our technology in their real-world setting. A trial generally results in budgeting for a pilot that can range in size from ten to more than 50 units. During the pilot, we support our customers closely to ensure their success. Data is compiled throughout to assist our customer in making a larger enterprise-wide justification, purchase and deployment. It is our belief that investment pre- and post-sale with prospects that have the potential for enterprise adoption creates a predictable pipeline of opportunity for our devices and their entrenchment as they become the organizational standard for our customers. Enterprise customers range from large government organizations with full fielding potential of more than 1,000 handheld devices to leading biopharma companies with capacity for ten or more desktop devices per site.

● | Grow the installed base through expansion of commercial channels. Since the commercial launch of our first handheld, the installed base of our handheld and desktop devices has grown to more than 2,300 devices over 45 countries. With our handheld and desktop device installations now taking root in the United States, we will focus on expanding our commercial channels to better serve the forensics, life sciences research, bioprocessing, quality assurance/quality control, and synthetic biology markets. We look to expand both our direct channel in the United States and our international reach. We anticipate growing our network of international distributors focused in regions with a concentrated and rapidly expanding life sciences presence, specifically, Europe, China, Japan, India, and South Korea. We look to have local application and support specialists and sales managers supporting our distribution partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deepen our footprint into the rapidly growing bioprocessing market. We designed our first desktop device to accelerate development and enhance production by identifying and quantifying extracellular species critical to cell health and productivity. They sit alongside bioreactors and fermenters producing drug candidates, functional proteins, cell and gene therapies, and synthetic biology derived products. We look to expand our product line with additional panels, for example focused extracellular panels, and intracellular analysis, such as cellular flux, and pathway analysis. Consistent with our thesis of driving simplicity and convenience of measurement, we will progress from an at-line measurement tool to an on-line integrated device with comprehensive bioprocess analytics and control. Our novel aseptic sampling technology, obtained through our acquisition of TRACE Analytics GmbH, provides a measurable step forward in our goal to move from at-line to on-line devices. We believe our technology platform can serve as the cornerstone of an integrated “bioprocess brain” by monitoring and managing the comprehensive extracellular environment.

● | Expand our customer-driven pipeline of new point-of-need applications. We will continue to leverage our integrated sample preparation and microfluidic separations platform to expand our pipeline of new, customer-driven point-of-need applications that can be addressed by both our handheld and desktop devices. As our customers continue to prove out new applications in areas such as diagnostics and proteomics, we will look to incorporate select assays investigated by these customers into our handheld and desktop devices where those form factors can accelerate usage. We have already incorporated a number of customer-driven assays into both MX908 and Rebel and will continue to do so as we believe this will provide us with an expanding list of new point-of-need applications and market opportunities within forensics, life sciences research, bioprocessing, quality assurance/quality control and synthetic biology. In addition, we continue to make advancements in our core technologies to drive the evolution of our product portfolio beyond current applications and needs to enter new markets.

Our Industry Background
Conventional Mass Spec -- The Mainframe Computer of the Analytical Laboratory
Mass Spec is the gold-standard analytical technique for molecular analysis. This technology is highly regarded for its ability to provide an extraordinarily detailed analysis of a wide variety of molecular samples -- from small molecule chemicals to large complex proteins. Mass Spec instruments identify the components of samples via highly detailed mass-to-charge (m/z) measurements, and in some cases, can quantify those components. Together with its associated front-end separation technologies, Mass Spec can resolve and analyze the most complex of samples with high fidelity.
However, while Mass Spec is an extremely powerful analytical technique, the capabilities of conventional Mass Spec instruments are largely relegated to centralized laboratory settings due to their size, complexity, and high price. When compared in context to the computer industry, conventional Mass Spec instruments represent the mainframe computer of the analytical laboratory.
The Democratization of Mass Spec—Handhelds and Desktops
Given the inherent limitations of conventional mainframe Mass Spec instruments, we believe there is a compelling opportunity for handheld and compact desktop Mass Spec devices. Analogous to the democratization of computer

technologies, as price, access, and complexity are reduced, user space expands, utilization increases, and new applications emerge. While our expectation is that centralized laboratory Mass Spec instruments will continue to exist in laboratory settings -- just as mainframes still exist today as supercomputers servicing the most challenging computational problems -- we believe that the democratization of Mass Spec will open up new markets and applications. We also see many parallels with how next generation gene sequencing, or NGS, was democratized and has expanded the market for NGS through desktop devices.
Our Technology Platform
We have developed a technology platform designed to bring Mass Spec out of the confines of central laboratories and to the point-of-need. Our technology platform democratizes the Mass Spec market with high-fidelity handheld and desktop devices. We believe this democratization gives rise to:

● | an expanded and more diverse set of users;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | more frequent measurements; and
--+--------------------------------


● | new use cases that were previously untenable.
--+----------------------------------------------

These results are possible as our handheld and desktop devices are designed for extreme convenience and speed, requiring minimal training and maintenance. Our platform uses proprietary microscale Mass Spec and microfluidic technologies to prepare, separate, and characterize species at the molecular level, with integrated machine learning and analytics to automatically provide answers regarding identity, purity, and quantity. The core elements of our technology platform include:

● | Our High-Pressure Mass Spec, or HPMS, approach enables Mass Spec at the point-of-need;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | microfluidics enable convenient sample preparations and fast separations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | analytics and machine learning technology provide actionable answers versus raw data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HPMS Approach Enables Mass Spec at the Point-of-Need
A key component of our technology is our proprietary microscale ion trap, which we estimate is 1,000 times smaller than those in conventional laboratory Mass Spec instruments. These microfabricated traps are able to operate a million times closer to atmospheric pressures than conventional Mass Spec instruments. This HPMS approach results in devices with dramatically smaller size and lower cost-of-goods through a reduction of vacuum pump requirements and power consumption, and an overall simplification of the hardware topology.

Conventional laboratory Mass Spec | Our Mass Spec

​
HPMS allows us to build ultracompact, high-fidelity measurement devices that are purpose-built for specific applications and deployable at the point-of-need. HPMS allows us to circumvent the complexities associated with the conventional and much larger, general-purpose, central laboratory Mass Spec instruments.
Our technology operates at size and cost scales that are multiple orders of magnitude smaller than conventional mainframe laboratory instruments. And while large, expensive, high maintenance vacuum systems have been a historical requirement for Mass Spec, our HPMS approach is capable of running with extreme efficiency on very small, robust, low-cost scroll pumps of our own proprietary designs. Our technology requires significantly less power than a 20-watt light bulb, allowing for up to 100x lower power consumption when compared to a competing product. The flexibility afforded by our approach provides access to existing and new market segments that were previously inconceivable for conventional Mass Spec instruments. We believe the insights and answers our devices provide will accelerate workflows, reduce costs and offer transformational opportunities for our end users.
​
Microfluidics Enable Convenient Sampling and Fast Separations
Today, most central laboratory Mass Spec instruments are paired with large, complex solid and liquid handling systems for sample preparation and separation. Common examples include liquid chromatography stacks and robotic sample preparation systems. These systems are engineered for general applications and require large quantities of solvents, high level of maintenance, and expertly trained users, leading to higher operating costs.
Our approach integrates proprietary microfluidic sample preparation, separation, and ionization technologies on a single chip that can be produced efficiently at scale using semiconductor microfabrication techniques. These microfluidic chips can be paired with our microscale Mass Spec technology to create devices with extraordinary performance that are accessible and usable at the point-of-need by non-experts.

Our integrated microfluidics—sample injection, preparation, separation and electrospray simplified
Our integrated microfluidic chip brings the benefits of:

● | highly controlled small sample injections at the nanoliter, or nL, scale;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | integrated preparation such as desalting;
--+------------------------------------------


● | extractions and preconcentration by physical and chemical properties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capillary electrophoresis, or CE, for extremely high-resolution separations of complex samples; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | integrated nanoscale electrospray ionization.
--+----------------------------------------------

The integrated microfluidic CE can perform extremely high-performance separations of a wide range of molecular species from small molecule metabolites, amino acids, and vitamins, to intact antibodies and other proteins. Importantly for our platform, microfluidic CE is electrically driven and requires no bulky liquid pumping and valving systems. The microfluidic chip consumes only 100-200 nL of electrolyte per minute making it remarkably efficient with source and waste fluids. Microfluidic CE separations can be an order of magnitude or faster than similar chromatography separations. This allows for highly complex separations with high resolution to be completed in minutes.
In 2022, we strengthened our core microfluidic technology with the acquisition of Trace, which enables us to provide on-line aseptic sampling technology used in bioprocess monitoring and control. Aseptic sampling allows for highly precise, on-line monitoring without any loss of bioreactor volume. A reusable or single-use probe that incorporates a diffusion membrane is inserted in the bioreactor, preserving precious media and product in cell culture and fermentation processes. 
Complementing our mass spec analysis, Trace also brings to us an enzyme-based electrochemical biosensor technology that generates an electrical signal proportional to concentration of targeted analytes enabling real-time monitoring and control of additional analytes, some of which are difficult to measure with mass spec (e.g. glucose and lactate).

11



Aseptic sampling enables on-line automated monitoring and control of bioprocesses.
Aseptic sampling provides many benefits, including cell-free, sterile and safe sampling with no loss of volume or prep required, thereby saving operator time and reducing lab costs. We expect our microfluidic aseptic sampling to serve as the interface for future on-line mass spec based devices. 
Analytics and Machine Learning Technology Provide Actionable Answers, Not Just Raw Data
The third crucial element of our technology platform is holistic device design with embedded analytics and machine learning. Our development team designs devices for a specific purpose, rather than for a wide scope of often disparate needs. Conventional Mass Spec manufacturers focus their attention on canonical analytical specifications such as “instrument resolution” or “detection limit” or “data rate” in the hopes of appealing to a wide range of laboratory specialist needs. Our devices are designed to do a job quickly, easily, and cost effectively. Achieving that aim requires very sophisticated autonomous and adaptive control systems and the machine learning engine to interpret the data and produce a clear, accurate result.
Control/optimization: Conventional Mass Spec configuration and tuning is highly complex. An example of such a configuration panel is shown on the right below. Our devices need to manage themselves autonomously for maximum value to the customer. They can manage themselves by adapting to environmental factors like elevation, humidity, temperature, and vibration, and by optimizing themselves for the analytical objectives of the user, such as looking for traces of potent drug substances or sniffing for airborne hazards. This ability to automatically control the system reduces or eliminates the user’s responsibility and opportunity for error in set up, optimization, and troubleshooting. Our 

12



product’s “settings” screen shown below on the left looks very simple, but the embedded analytics and machine learning system controls and optimizes more than a hundred parameters continuously in real-time.

MX908 Settings/Configuration | Laboratory Mass Spec Settings/Configuration

​
Machine learning/embedded analytics: The integrated analysis of our platform’s data is also critical to our customers’ success. Conventional platforms may give the user basic tools to view data, and some limited analysis functionality, but they fall far short of completing the analysis loop. “Out of the box” machine and statistical learning methods are not really applicable to complex analytical sensor data and real-life molecular systems. Our data team has a commercial track record of embedding a “scientist in the box” with highly customized statistical and machine learning methods for our platforms to complete the customer experience. Several examples of these elements are highlighted below in the “Our Products” section.

Our devices are designed to provide fast, statistically-rigorous answers by providingautonomous control systems and applying rigorous machine learning methods.
Our Products
We were founded on a vision to deliver high quality Mass Spec to a broad set of users at the point-of-need. We offer handheld and desktop devices, each of which are capable of providing quick, high-fidelity and actionable results. These aspects are important to our customers, who previously have had to choose between a slow and thorough analysis by Mass Spec in a laboratory or a point-of-need result that may have been more timely, but provided only a partial 

13



measurement picture prone to false-positives. For instance, forensics customers who do not have access to laboratory-based Mass Spec instruments have at best had access to the field techniques of Ion-mobility spectrometry and Raman/FTIR spectroscopy, each with its own severe limitation of specificity (ability to distinguish one chemical from another) and sensitivity (ability to detect minute amounts), respectively. Our bioprocess customers have likewise only had access to a cropped measurement picture by largely relying on simple enzymatic and electrochemical sensors that can measure just a few simple gases and other analytes with poor accuracy. Our devices are changing this paradigm and providing laboratory-like results at the point-of-need.
MX908®
Launched in June 2017, MX908 is a handheld, battery-powered, Mass Spec device designed for rapid analysis of solid, liquid, vapor and aerosol materials of unknown identity. It is an agile, multi-purpose device utilized by a wide spectrum of user segments for a variety of forensic field applications such as chemical, explosive, priority drug and HazMat operations, detecting materials at the trace level.
We have sold approximately 2,000 MX908s into every U.S. state, in over 45 countries and across five continents. More than 8,000 operators, including in numerous domestic and foreign government agencies, have been trained to use the MX908.
When a civilian or military first responder, customs agent, or front-line worker is presented with residue on a package, a powder in the ER, pills at a border crossing, an apparent overdosing individual, or a mass casualty event, immediate actionable information is needed. The U.S. opioid crisis in particular is driving demand for broadly capable point-of-need measurement devices that can detect a multitude of hazards at trace quantities.
The MX908 detects trace quantities of more than 150 named dangerous materials, including fentanyl and its many derivatives, explosives, and hazardous chemical agents with sensitivity comparable to existing field-based technologies, but with much higher specificity. This allows users to conduct rapid field analysis for a broad range of unknown substances at trace levels that would typically lead to confusion and false positives in other instruments. The device is also able to identify a far greater number of substances than other trace technologies and with one million times the dynamic range of those other handheld or mobile technologies. Compared to a leading transportable Mass Spec product, the MX908 is up to 15x faster, up to 10x smaller and up to 2x cheaper. The MX908 is able to start up in less than a minute, completing analysis of gas and vapor materials in less than ten seconds, and solids and liquids in less than a minute.
The MX908 was designed to operate in harsh outdoor environments such as pervasive rain and dust, and scorching to freezing temperatures in a nimble 4.3 kg (approximately 10 lb) handheld form factor. Our systems also undergo extensive mechanical shock, drop, vibration, and environmental testing as part of the development and certification process.
Designed with the non-technical user in mind, the user interface on the MX908 requires no Mass Spec knowledge for navigation, operation or interpretation of results. The MX908 user interface is very mission driven. These mission modes provide a categorization of functionality, allow the device to guide operators through proper procedures with visual cues, and present results in a manner most relevant for that operational intent. The mission modes also allow the 

14



software to optimize the hardware operation of the MX908 to maximize sensitivity and specificity for a given class of chemicals, much as a laboratory chemist would do by changing the settings on their conventional Mass Spec.

The MX908’s machine-learning software, enabled by our proprietary technology platform, serves as a critical element of the device. For example, one of the challenges associated with analyzing fentanyl derivatives is that there are potentially thousands of pharmacologically-active variants for this same compound. However, MX908 is pre-programmed to evaluate against the dozen most common fentanyl variants and is then able to utilize a machine learning classifier to look for characteristic mass fragment loss patterns that are suggestive of the more than 2,000 fentanyl analogs.
Since introducing the MX908, we have continued to expand the device’s capability through mission add-ons such as offering an Aerosol Module accessory to detect and identify aerosolized chemical hazards, adding targets to allow responders to identify additional priority drug substances, and providing a Bluetooth capability that enables seamless data transfer and accelerates support in the field. We recently added pesticide identification capability, which we developed in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Field agency personnel can now easily and safely identify toxic chemicals used in illegal marijuana growing operations on federal lands and quickly begin site remediation, instead of waiting weeks for lab results. All these added capabilities are aimed to address gaps in responders’ workflows, increase engagement, and drive utilization. 
We are currently working to expand the MX908’s mission add-ons to support the detection of adulterated and counterfeit pharmaceuticals and have a roadmap of applications in quality control and quality assurance, including GxP cleaning validation.
Services and Consumables
Our MX908 comes with a standard warranty for up to one year from purchase. Our customers also can purchase extended warranty service plans, which include hardware repair and replacement coverage, technical support, and software updates. We designed the MX908 to be intuitive and easy-to-use, while ensuring that the MX908 is operating as it is intended is critical to our customers. The annual and extended warranty service plans provide the customer the ability to contact us to assist in validating their results given the severity and context of the situations in which our devices operate. Our technical support, also known as our Reachback program, allows any participating MX908 user to email, text, or call a 908 Devices Scientific Support Team member to receive support 24 hours per day, 365 days per year to ensure the MX908 is working as intended. The Scientific Support Team is staffed by M.Sc. and Ph.D. chemists and forensic scientists expert in the operation of the MX908 and other field analytical technologies. Our extended warranty service plans are sold with multiyear commitments, which allows us to deepen our relationship with 

15



customers and provides us with an upfront payment, a predictable recurring revenue stream, and an opportunity to offer additional future services.
For simplicity and convenience, we also sell single-use swab samplers for the analysis of liquid and solid materials. These swab samplers are most heavily used today by customers who are evaluating drug substances. However, we designed the MX908 so that it does not require swab samplers or any other consumables for a number of other applications. Our customers value the low-logistics tail of our MX908.
RebelTM
The Rebel is a small desktop analyzer providing real-time information on the extracellular environment in bioprocesses. Compared to a traditional central laboratory high-performance liquid chromatography, or HPLC, Mass Spec assay, Rebel’s price per sample is up to 10 times lower, at approximately one-third of the capital cost, and delivers answers up to 2,000 times faster. Rebel provides results within seven minutes, enabling critical on-the-spot decisions regarding bioprocess media optimization, accelerating process-development cycles and maximizing bioreactor efficiency. Customers are using Rebel in environments subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other regulatory guidelines regarding biological and pharmaceutical product quality, or GxP environments, to evaluate fresh media for conformity to standards, track the extracellular environment and metabolic flux during growth cycles, monitor performance during stress experiments, and characterize spent media.

Since the launch of the Rebel in November 2019, we have sold 150 units and 49 of those units have been placed with the top-20 pharmaceutical companies by revenue and 23 organizations have purchased multiple units. Our focus has been on increasing U.S. placements, but we also have a meaningful international opportunity and have recently sold Rebels in China, Japan, South Korea and Europe.
Cells have been harnessed to serve as microscopic factories producing myriad molecular species large and small. The markets for cellular-derived products include therapeutics, including cell therapy and personalized medicine, new and sustainable foods and beverages, and industrial materials. Many of these products, such as protein-based

therapeutics, can only be economically produced by cells in a bioreactor. Making these products in an efficient and reproducible way remains a challenge to our customers in bioprocessing. Cell culture media forms the critical growth environment for the cell. Our customers’ measurement of this extracellular environment in bioprocesses is critical to their development and operational efficiency.
However, it is rare that researchers conducting these types of experiments have analytical tools for extracellular media characterization on their local bench, which means samples need to be frozen, packaged, and transported to core laboratories for analysis with large HPLC Mass Spec instruments. This adds substantial delays and cost and typically takes three to six weeks to produce lab reports equivalent to those produced by the Rebel in only 15 minutes. The following graphics illustrate the complexity and processing time of a traditional HPLC Mass Spec analysis compared to the Rebel process.

Rebel is currently configured to report concentrations of 33 critical extracellular metabolites in cell culture media, such as amino acids, vitamins, and biogenic amines, which are known to substantially affect the growth profile and properties of the resulting biological entities and their expressed materials. Incorporating our microfluidic sample handling and CE technology, as well as our microscale Mass Spec technology, Rebel’s internal autosampler is capable of queueing approximately 96 such samples for unattended analysis and delivering reported concentrations for each sample.

A fit-for-purpose at-line system, the Rebel is designed to be located within the same laboratory as a bioreactor, enabling more frequent monitoring of key cell media parameters. To run this analysis, the Rebel requires as little as one microliter of cell culture media with little sample preparation. This allows customers to run more tests while preserving precious cell culture media, which is extremely valuable for small batches as used in cell therapy and personalized medicine.
The Rebel, using its onboard algorithms, eliminates the need for manual calibration and delivers processed and actionable results in real-time. As runs are completed, users can access the report either as a PDF print out or a laboratory information system compatible file exported to the network. The Rebel software is compliant for operation in GxP environments.
Consumables and Services
Rebel’s operation requires a consumable kit that includes:

● | one microfluidic preparation and separation chip;
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | diluent electrolyte for samples, including internal standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | background electrolyte for separation; and
--+-------------------------------------------

17




● | performance qualification and calibration standards.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

Currently, customers of Rebel who are actively utilizing the device are consuming on average approximately half of a 200-sample kit per month. With continuous operation, the Rebel is capable of consuming approximately one 200-sample kit a day.
We also offer an annual certification kit and service plan. The certification kit is shipped to the customer, who loads the provided samples, and executes a certification protocol. The system is remotely qualified and certified based on the data acquired meeting factory specifications.
Annual and extended warranty and service plans are available for the Rebel.
Maven™ and Trace C2
The Maven, launched in January 2023, is our first on-line device for bioprocess monitoring and control. Connecting directly to a single bioreactor, Maven provides real-time continuous monitoring and control of glucose and lactate in cell culture and fermentation processes. Glucose and lactate are critical parameters that biopharmaceutical process development scientists must monitor to ensure optimal cell viability and to improve product yield, quality, efficacy and safety. Taking measurements as frequently as every two minutes, Maven operates without having to manually draw samples out of the bioreactor due to its aseptic sampling probe. This approach preserves precious media and product and reduces the risk of cell culture contamination. Maven precisely monitors nutrient and metabolite concentrations at low levels—0.01 g/L of glucose and 0.05 g/L of lactate. This is especially beneficial in cell therapy applications where tight control of cell culture conditions is vital.

In addition to providing real-time measurements, Maven comes with integrated PID and on/off controllers that enable out-of-the-box feeding automation. The Maven is GMP compliant, takes up a small footprint, and in keeping with our focus on simplicity, is easy to use. Maven can be used in concert with our at-line Rebel device, which quantitates over 30 analytes, to improve and optimize cell culture feeding strategies.
The Trace C2 provides on-line monitoring of methanol or ethanol and control of substrate feeding in fermentation processes. Integrated into the device is an aseptic sampling probe that enables sampling with no loss of bioreactor volume and no increased risk of process contamination. The device includes a dedicated on-board peristaltic pump and an integrated PID controller that can be used for feeding substrates without any additional auxiliary equipment. The Trace C2 and related sampling products were developed by Trace, which we acquired in August of 2022.
Consumables and services
Consumable sets of buffers, probes and biosensors are required for the Maven, Trace C2 and related sampling devices. Annual and extended warranty and service plans are available for these devices.

ZipChip
Our ZipChip solution is a plug-and-play, high-resolution separation platform that optimizes Mass Spec sample analysis. Our ZipChip platform consists of a ZipChip Interface, which is installed into a conventional Mass Spec instrument, and consumable microfluidic chips, or ZipChips. We designed this technology to be compatible with third party Mass Spec instruments. Powered by our integrated microfluidic technology, the ZipChip platform allows researchers to consolidate a host of time-consuming biotherapeutic, metabolomic, and proteomic applications typically run on multiple instruments or configurations onto a single platform. With ZipChip, researchers can switch applications in minutes, instead of hours typical with an alternative such as liquid chromatography.
​

Leveraging our data analytics capabilities, we have also incorporated an automated software solution called DARWIN to expedite the analysis of the ZipChip and Mass Spec data for proteins and biotherapeutics. DARWIN eliminates most of the manual choices, selections, and decisions encumbering typical analysis software and directly and rapidly reports identified species, modifications and relative abundances.
Since launch of the ZipChip platform in March 2016, we have sold 215 ZipChip Interfaces and have established 25 multi-unit accounts in leading, global pharmaceutical organizations and academic institutions. Our ZipChip platform is compatible with market-leading conventional Mass Spec instruments found in laboratories worldwide.
As an open-access discovery platform that can interface with more than 10,000 conventional Mass Spec instruments, ZipChip provides us the ability to leverage the growing list of newly established applications and publications from customers who have incorporated the device into their projects. By incorporating select assays investigated on the ZipChip by customers into our MX908 and Rebel devices, we can create an evolving pipeline of new customer-driven, point-of-need Mass Spec applications as the scope of analytes our devices can detect and analyze will continue to expand. We have already incorporated a number of the customer-driven assays in our MX908 and Rebel devices, and we are investigating several more for our future product pipeline.
Consumables and Services
We offer a variety of kits for the ZipChip Interface that include microfluidic ZipChips and different reagents optimized for a wide scope of applications. These kits include intact antibody, charge variance, metabolomics, peptide and oligonucleotides.
Annual and extended warranty and service plans are available for the ZipChip interface.
Market Opportunities
We have developed ultracompact, high-fidelity Mass Spec devices to interrogate the unknown and invisible and provide actionable results in critical-to-life point-of-need applications. Our first products are purpose-built handheld and 

19



desktop Mass Spec devices that currently address a range of applications and markets. We estimate our TAM for our devices was $5.7 billion in 2022, and is growing to an estimated $27 billion by 2027. The TAM for our handhelds was estimated to be $1.3 billion in 2022 with expansion to over $3.9 billion with software application extensions for GxP cleaning validation, and other related quality control assays. Our desktop devices supporting bioprocess development represented a total addressable market of $0.8 billion in 2022 expanding significantly to approximately $15 billion with execution of our roadmap and the rapid growth of cell therapy. We see additional future opportunity to address an estimated $3.6 billion in 2022 across the laboratory chromatography market space growing to more than $8.1 billion with further market growth and roadmap expansion into metabolomics and complex proteomics. Our estimates of our TAM are based on potential customer research and development spending, addressable aspects of potential customers’ end product development process, and potential platform usage. We also utilize estimated penetration and placement rates for our platform with potential customers in our target markets and historical patterns for consumables usage.

Our TAM for all device placements in 2022 and expanding in 2027 with product roadmap and market growth
Our Initial Market—Field Forensics
Forensic labs have historically used conventional Mass Spec instruments to chemically analyze a diverse array of submitted samples. Testing for controlled substances is one of the major drivers for the use of Mass Spec in the field forensics setting. According to the latest available data from the Bureau of Justice, U.S. criminal forensic laboratories handled approximately 4 million requests, roughly 1.2 million of which were controlled substances-related. We believe that this increase in requests will be even more acute for the point-of-need setting.
In the field forensics setting, high accuracy and fidelity can be just as important at the point-of-need as it is in the laboratory. Simple and inexpensive colorimetric tests are being abandoned in many jurisdictions due to their extremely narrow and poor performance capabilities, in favor of handheld technologies with broad lab-like capabilities. This is creating an expanded market of individual users that is a multiple of the centralized laboratory Mass Spec instrument market.
The need for such field technologies is acute for controlled substances and identification of other priority chemicals and hazards at trace levels. The toxicity of fentanyl and its analogs is 100 to 10,000 times the potency of morphine, creating an opioid crisis of unprecedented scale and breadth. 

20



Fentanyl is considered to be the deadliest drug threat facing the United States today according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In November 2022, the DEA issued a public safety alert warning of a sharp increase in the lethality of fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills. The alert noted that DEA testing found six out of 10 pills contained a potentially lethal dose, an increase from the DEA’s September 2021 alert that four out of 10 pills were found to contain a potentially lethal dose. In addition, the DEA announced in December 2022 that it had seized over 50.6 million fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills in 2022, more than double the amount of fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills it had seized in 2021.
The potency and diversity of these emerging classes pose a major challenge for point-of-need measurements. Near invisible quantities of opioids can be fatal, and street drugs are often heavily obscured with filler materials, making trace detection with high-fidelity technologies an imperative for success. The diversity of the problem also drives the need for agility with devices that can be rapidly updated in the field with new machine learning updates. There are thousands of variants of these highly potent opioids, and other emerging classes such as cathinones and cannabinoids that will further exacerbate the problem.
​
In addition to controlled substances, point-of-need Mass Spec instruments can address a wide variety of other use cases, including:

● | first responders and local, state, and federal law enforcement;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | U.S. and international defense and homeland security;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | forensic laboratories’ case management and triage;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | package inspection for postal services, couriers, customs agencies, and corporate mail rooms;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | facility safety for hotels, local, state and federal government facilities, and private enterprises; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | quality assurance and control.
--+-------------------------------

We estimate that the TAM for our handhelds was $1.3 billion per year in 2022 for trace detection of drugs, explosives, priority chemicals, and other hazards on surfaces and in the air. Our TAM expands to $3.9 billion with software application extensions for GxP cleaning validation, and other related quality control assays.
Life Sciences
Mass Spec addresses a significant number of applications along the life sciences research and biopharma value chain. It is integral in research and discovery, drug development, product validation and quality control. Biologic therapeutic modalities and all cell-based products more broadly, use bioreactors to manufacture product in two stages – process development and clinical and GxP manufacturing.
Within a cell, thousands of intertwined processes govern the cells ability to produce various proteins, its ability to perform a specific function, and its energy and waste expenditure. But efficient intracellular operations are also highly reliant on the extracellular environment – the cell culture media. In bioreactors, the timely influx of raw materials, environmental controls, and management of waste can be not only essential to efficiency, but literally to the life or death of the cells. The worldwide cell culture media market itself was estimated to be a $3.6 billion business in 2021. Regardless of how carefully the starting cell culture media has been designed and selected, bioprocessing is by definition a dynamic and inhomogeneous process. Cellular biology is complicated and unpredictable.
Due to issues with both the existing point-of-need solutions and alternative laboratory-based workflows, development scientists currently lack an ideal solution to accurately analyze the extracellular environment during or after the growth cycle without having to compromise between timing or completeness.

21



High-pressure Mass Spec combined with microfluidic sampling and separations will allow for significant efficiencies and new applications for these technologies within life sciences. With real-time access to comprehensive media profiles, bioprocess development scientists can:

● | accelerate their product development cycles with feedback in minutes rather than weeks;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improve process yield and lower costs throughout their value chain;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enable a broad range of complex therapeutic modalities in biopharmaceuticals; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increase the probability of successfully developing cell-based products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe these efficiencies will lead to substantial growth opportunities in biologic-based therapeutics where a better understanding of the extracellular environment is a crucial element of bioprocessing.
For antibody therapeutics, a key requirement is that monoclonal production cell lines not only produce high titers of antibody but with acceptable Critical Quality Attributes, or CQAs. The extracellular media properties can greatly impact both the titer and the CQAs of the produced antibody. Likewise, for cell and gene therapeutics, management of the complex mammalian cell culture system and measurement and control of the extracellular environment is crucial. Historically, bioprocessing has been focused on large-scale batched production of monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs, using genetically stable clones, whose production has largely been optimized over many years of refinement. Today, newer advanced modalities, like cell and gene therapies, are fueling growth in the market while introducing variability of input materials (e.g., patient or donor cells, transient transfected cell lines), higher cost of goods sold, and the necessity for small-batched production – driven by smaller patient populations and the need to scale out. This change is driving manufacturers toward increased monitoring and optimization at a level of intensity beyond what is seen historically.
While mAbs are forecasted to continue to dominate end-product sales over the near term, it is estimated that by 2027 the pipeline of cell and gene therapies will be approximately 7,000 assets, representing more than 50% of the total biologics pipeline. A massive retooling of global bioprocessing capabilities is underway to accommodate the needed small batched production – one per patient in some cases. We estimated our bioprocessing TAM to be $0.8 billion in 2022, across approximately 1,800 sites and 175,000 batches to support process development, and this is expected to expand to approximately $15 billion TAM by 2027 with the execution of our roadmap and the rapid growth of cell therapy.
Our product development roadmap for the Rebel platform includes the extension of current capabilities and move to an on-line and, ultimately, a real-time “bioreactor brain”. In process development today, smaller scale bioreactors are outfitted with a variety of disconnected multi-party simple sensors and controllers. With the increasing trend toward highly parallelized systems with many small-scale bioreactors running simultaneously, manual sampling becomes a significant bottleneck. The roadmap expansion of Rebel’s analyte panel to address core culture kinetics (e.g., glucose, lactate, ammonium, pH, dissolved oxygen) and attributes like cell count, and viable cell density means that this future on-line Rebel+ system could have a uniquely comprehensive assessment of the present state and trajectory of the extracellular environment. Historical data profiles across parallel bioreactors and designed experiments form an excellent basis for machine learning and multivariable predictive control to optimize experimental variables to maximize yield, minimize risk of loss, and improve kinetics – the “bioreactor brain”. An outsize portion of this opportunity is driven by testing in autologous cell therapies and is commensurate with the total expected cell batches produced.
Future Market Opportunities
The fastest and most convenient way to explore new applications incorporating our platform technology is through interfacing with a conventional general-purpose laboratory Mass Spec instrument. Our laboratory interface connects our proprietary microfluidic chips, called ZipChips, to conventional Mass Spec Instruments, in a simple and customer friendly manner to form a discovery platform. Our research customers incorporate our ZipChip Interface into their projects due to its preparation convenience and separation speed. These customers prove-out new assays spanning a 

22



range of markets from diagnostics to consumer health and beauty, to agrochemical, oil and gas, and defense. They measure such things as novel therapeutics, quality and process attributes, and explore metabolomics and complex proteomics. We estimate our ZipChip platform was able to address $3.6 billion in 2022 across the research chromatography market space growing to more than $8.1 billion with further market growth roadmap expansion into metabolomics and complex proteomics. The resulting pipeline and market multiplier for subsequent point-of-need products has not been considered and may be significant.
Customers
We sell our products worldwide through an experienced direct sales force as well as through domestic and international channel distribution partners. Our customers are primarily in the pharmaceutical and biotech market, the government market and to a lesser extent, academic markets. 
We are always looking for new opportunities to engage directly with our customers. To that end, we held user meetings in 2021 and 2022, which covered the full breadth of our product platforms and their applications. These events brought more than 175 attendees together, both virtually and in person, to hear our customers share their success using our handheld and desktop devices to provide rapid and robust actionable information at the point of need. These customer talks spanned the breadth of our customer base: from pharma – with Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck, AstraZeneca and Sartorius – to top research institutions – with MIT, Johns Hopkins University and Dana Farber Cancer Institute – to government agencies – with the USDA, Maine Drug Enforcement Agency, Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Fresno, California Police Department. 
It was inspiring to hear the impact our technology is having across a range of topics, from bioprocess monitoring to identification of counterfeit pharmaceuticals to high-throughput drug discovery. And, perhaps even most importantly, these user meetings give our customers the opportunity to engage in discussion together – not only to share their experiences but also to increase awareness and educate each other on the value of our technology across these different application areas. 
Manufacturing and Supply
Our manufacturing strategy has two components: to outsource subassemblies or assemblies to domestic contract manufacturers where it is cost and capital favorable, and to use our internal manufacturing facilities for the balance of our production needs. Our primary in-house manufacturing facilities are located at our headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. These facilities are ISO 9001:2015 certified and include approximately 5,100 square feet of configurable production assembly floor, 1,800 square feet of advanced machining space, and 2,000 square feet of configurable cleanroom. Inventory is held in our Boston facilities in a 700 square foot controlled-access cage. As a result of the Trace acquisition, we also have in-house manufacturing facilities in Braunschweig, Germany.
Devices
The MX908, Rebel and ZipChip Interface are manufactured, tested and shipped from our Boston facility. The Maven and related sampling devices are manufactured, tested and shipped from our Braunschweig facility. Several custom components are fabricated by third party suppliers, including printed circuit boards and cables, and metal and plastic mechanical components. The assembly of technology-sensitive components such as our proprietary vacuum pumps and ion trap/ionization module is completed in-house.
Currently, our Boston manufacturing facility is capable of supporting the production of approximately 2,000 MX908, Rebel and ZipChip Interface units combined per year. When our annual sales exceed 2,000 units, we expect that we would need to either expand our in-house production operations, or transfer some or all aspects of assembly to contract manufacturers, to accommodate larger run-rates. We believe there are numerous domestic and international contract manufacturers that could be qualified to produce the MX908, Rebel and/or ZipChip Interface when third party demand for our products outpace our current manufacturing capacity. The autosampler subassembly of the Rebel is supplied by a single supplier, Spark Holland B.V.

23



Volume manufacturing of the ZipChip Interface had been previously outsourced to Columbia Tech, an ISO 9001 wholly-owned subsidiary of Coghlin Companies, Inc., through September 30, 2021. Our Boston facility can and has manufactured ZipChip Interfaces, and upon review of our and Columbia Tech’s manufacturing processes, we transitioned manufacturing of the ZipChip Interface back to our Boston facility beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021. The final testing and shipment of ZipChip Interfaces has been and will continue to be completed from our Boston facility. Additionally, we maintain resources to handle all warranty and service of our devices.
We are continuously evaluating and updating our supply chain to ensure our ability to respond to customer demand for our products. For example, we have relationships with a number of machine shops and electronics suppliers that can provide components for our devices, including components currently provided by a single source. We plan to continue the diversification of our supply chain as we scale. We use our annual demand planning to assess initial device needs for each year, and we update and reassess those estimates as needed, including with respect to the levels of inventory that we believe will be required to support anticipated customer demand.
Consumables
The MX908 incorporates a number of non-proprietary consumables that are commercial-off-the-shelf available and sourced from a number of reputable suppliers. Sampling swabs that are used for the analysis of liquid and solid materials in the MX908 are currently single-sourced from DSA Detection. While we believe that alternatives are available, it would take time to identify and validate replacement swab samples, which could compromise our ability to supply these to our MX908 customers on a timely basis.
Consumable kits for the Rebel and ZipChip Interface include electrolytes, standards, and microfluidic chips. All assay kits and standards are assembled in our Boston cleanroom facilities. Component reagents and standards are widely available from multiple suppliers. Our microfluidic chips are produced and assembled in our Boston cleanroom facilities. The substrate is supplied by Micronit Microtechnologies B.V. While we believe that alternative suppliers would be available, it would take time to identify and qualify alternate suppliers and transfer design requirements to them, which could negatively affect our ability to supply these chips to our Rebel and ZipChip customers on a timely basis.
Sales and Marketing
We distribute our devices and consumables via direct field sales and support organizations located in North America and through a combination of our own sales force and more than 40 third party distributors in domestic and international markets which include Australia, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. In North America, we use distribution partners to provide our products to end customers where a contract vehicle is required. Since the commercial launch of our first handheld, the installed base of our devices has grown to more than 2,300 devices across more than 45 countries.
Our domestic sales force and international partners inform our current and potential customers of current product offerings, new target applications, and advances in our technologies and products. As our primary point of contact in the marketplace, our sales force focuses on delivering a consistent marketing message and high level of customer service, while also attempting to help us better understand the evolving market and customer needs.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 79 people employed in sales, sales support and marketing. This staff is primarily located in the United States and we have recently hired internationally, using a professional employment organization, to support our sales and applications efforts. We intend to significantly expand our sales, support, and marketing efforts in regions with a concentrated life sciences presence, including large pharmaceutical and biopharma companies. For example, we plan to establish a direct sales footprint in Europe, and to develop a distribution and support network in China. Additionally, we believe that there is significant opportunity in other Asia-Pacific countries such as India and South Korea as well as other areas such as Australia and South America. We plan to expand into these regions via initial penetration with distributors and then subsequent support with direct sales and support personnel.

24



Our business model is focused on driving the adoption of our products and maximizing use across our customers’ value chains. This is enabled through customer trials and partnerships that allows us to further understand the critical applications for our technology and inform our future developments and market expansion.
Our MX908 devices often are sold to governmental institutions and other customers that require participation in a tender process that involves preparation of extensive documentation and a lengthy review process. As a result of these factors, and the budget cycles of our customers, our sales cycle can often be six to twelve months, or longer. Our Rebel devices are relatively new to the life science marketplace and require a capital investment by our customers. The sales process typically involves numerous interactions and demonstrations with multiple people within an organization. Some potential customers conduct in-depth evaluations of the system, including running experiments at our Boston headquarters and comparing results from alternative systems and technologies.
Service and Support
We offer warranty and extended warranty service plans, as well as on-site training, in order to improve customer adoption of our products. Support under warranty and extended service contracts include the following:

● | Technical support. Customers can call a hot-line number 24 hours per day, 365 days per year for support on issues ranging from questions on proper usage of the device, to assistance in interpretation of chemical spectra to ensure the device is working as intended. We refer to this support as our Reachback program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Software updates and library updates. We periodically release updates to the embedded software in our products. These updates will ensure the ongoing functionality of our products and repair defects in the software. We also release updates and additions to our library of spectral images enabling identification of additional chemicals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Warranty. Our MX908 and ZipChip Interface devices are covered under a return-to-factory warranty model for repairs. Depending on availability, loaner units are made available to minimize downtime with our customers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We provide training at the customer’s location with the initial purchase of our devices. Each training event is between four to six hours and covers device functionality and hands-on training with the device. At the conclusion of the training, certificates are issued for all attendees. Additional training days are available on a per diem basis. For our desktop devices, we offer an advanced training and applications training to assist customers in implementing their required applications with our device.
Research and Development
Investment in research and development is at the core of our business strategy. Our research and development team is responsible for designing, developing and enhancing our products, as well as performing product testing and quality assurance activities. Members of our research and development team specialize in many functional areas including algorithms, machine learning, electrical and mechanical engineering as well as software development.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 68 full-time employees dedicated to research and development. Of these, approximately 40% have advanced degrees in engineering or the sciences. We have made substantial investments in product and technology development since our inception. Research and development expense totaled $17.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect our research and development expense to increase for the foreseeable future as we enhance our existing products, develop new products for our current markets and introduce new products in new markets.

25



We consider the holistic nature of our internal product development teams critical to our products’ success. Accordingly, our research and development team possesses functional expertise in critical areas such as:

● | chemistry, biochemistry, physics of Mass Spec and separations and sample processing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | embedded, desktop and mobile software engineering;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | machine learning, high-speed digital signal processing, multivariate statistical learning, algorithms and decision theory;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------


● | mechanical engineering and industrial design;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | analog, digital and mixed signal electronics engineering;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | ultra-efficient pumping and pneumatics engineering; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | microfluidic design, and volume fabrication at the micro- and meso-scale.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The majority of our research and development operations are conducted in our Boston facility. We also conduct additional research and development operations out of a second facility in Chapel Hill (approximately 2,000 square feet), North Carolina to support assay development for Rebel and ZipChip.
Our R&D and marketing teams also receive input from two Scientific Advisory Boards (SAB) implemented in 2021, one SAB board with deep expertise in bioprocess development, and cell and gene therapy processes and production, and the other SAB board made up of thought leaders in proteomics who will be invaluable to the continued advancement of our platform mass spec and microfluidic technology and its application to contemporary problems in proteomics-oriented life science research.
Competition
We have a range of competitors extending from small, privately held companies with single-point solutions to large, publicly-held corporations, including those with a portfolio of Mass Spec products, such as Agilent, Bruker, Danaher, Inficon, Teledyne, PerkinElmer, Shimadzu, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Waters Corp. Many of these companies have greater resources and market presence than we do.
We expect the markets for our products to remain highly competitive and dynamic and to reflect rapid technological evolution and continually evolving customer requirements. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors including our ability to:

● | offer differentiated point-of-need Mass Spec devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | translate market requirements into an engineering roadmap of new software and hardware features to remain competitive;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | demonstrate the value of employing our products at the point-of-need through accelerated workflows; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide pro-active support and service that delights our customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
Protection of our intellectual property is fundamental to the long-term success of our business. We believe that our continued success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, the skills of our employees and the ability of our employees to continue to innovate and incorporate advances into our products. We regard our products and the internally developed software embedded in our products as proprietary.
We rely primarily on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, as well as contractual provisions with employees and third parties, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. Our patent strategy is to seek broad protection on fundamental enabling technologies, and layer on additional patents on specific implementations or methods of operation critical to our present and anticipated products, and to prevent competitive operation. While our expertise in signal processing and machine learning is critical to our success, we typically keep these inventions as trade secrets to avoid public disclosure. Some high value consumables have been engineered with clandestine product integrity features to inhibit duplication or counterfeiting efforts of our intellectual property. We provide our products to customers pursuant to terms and conditions that impose restrictions on use and disclosure. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property using contractual obligations, by requiring employees, consultants and contractors with access to our proprietary information to execute nondisclosure, non-competition and assignment of intellectual property agreements. In addition, we generally control access to our proprietary and confidential information through the use of internal and external controls.
Our foundational technology in the area of miniature Mass Spec originated as an effort at Oak Ridge National Laboratories led by our Scientific Founder J. Michael Ramsey, now a Professor of Chemistry at the University of North Carolina.
As of December 31, 2022, our owned patent assets included approximately 19 U.S. patents, no pending U.S. patent applications, 41 foreign patents and five pending foreign patent applications in various foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, the European Union, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan. The subject matter covered by our owned patent assets includes core aspects of compact Mass Spec technology, a design for a handheld Mass Spec device, a design for a modular Mass Spec chamber, patents for multiple ionization modes and adaptive pressure operation within survey period, the determination of preferred ionization mode, adaptive resolution control, adaptive operation to reduce power consumption, and the detection of positive and negative ions.
As of December 31, 2022, our in-licensed patent assets included approximately 30 U.S. patents, two pending U.S. patent applications, 18 foreign patents, and three pending foreign patent applications. The subject matter covered by our in-licensed patent assets includes a microfabricated ionization source and a microfabricated ionizer chip, microscale Mass Spec systems, devices and related methods, a miniature charged particle trap with an elongated trapping region for Mass Spec, high pressure Mass Spec signal enhancement by means of convective transport, electrospray ionization interface to high pressure Mass Spec, a method of sample injection for chemical separations in microfluidic devices, integrated sample processing for electrospray ionization devices, and microchips with integrated multiple electrospray ionization emitters and related methods, systems and devices. Excluding any patent term extension, the currently issued 908 Devices-owned patents are expected to expire between 2032 to 2038. The currently issued in-licensed patents are expected to expire from 2023 to 2039. We do not expect any of the in-licensed patents that are set to expire in 2022 to have a material effect on our business as those patents relate to a prior design for the ion trap and we have since in-licensed new patents covering the current design.
We also seek to protect our brand through procurement of trademark rights. As of December 31, 2022, we owned eight registered trademarks in the United States, nine registered foreign trademarks, and two U.S. pending trademark applications. Our registered trademarks and pending trademark applications include trademarks for 908 Devices, Rebel, MX908, ZipChip, MAVEN, and our logo. In order to supplement protection of our brand, we have also registered several internet domain names.

UT-Battelle
In June 2012, we entered into two license agreements, which were subsequently amended in August 2013 with UT-Battelle, LLC, or UTB, which manages and operates the Oak Ridge National Laboratory under its prime contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, pursuant to which UTB granted us an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned by UTB related to Mass Spec technology to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize products, services and methods that are covered by such patent rights, or the Licensed Products, in the defined fields of use within forensics, life sciences, industrial process monitoring and food and environmental testing and safety. The patents are related to the design and operation of microscale ion traps and ion sources with flexible operating pressures, and were the first patents that enabled us to reduce the size of our Mass Spec platform. We refer to these two licenses as the UTB Agreements.
We paid UTB an upfront payment of $5,000 in connection with executing the UTB Agreements and made a payment of $15,000 in January 2013. In addition, we issued an aggregate of 73,750 shares of our common stock to UTB, which had an aggregate fair value at the time of issuance of approximately $25,200. Additionally, we must pay UTB a low-single digit percentage royalty on our net sales of Licensed Products that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to an annual minimum royalty payment owed to UTB of $70,000. We are also obligated to pay UTB a percentage of certain royalty income received from any sublicensees ranging from the lower- to mid-double-digit percentages. To date, we have not issued any sublicenses under the UTB Agreements. The are no future milestone payments to be made by the Company under the UTB Agreements.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed Products.
The UTB Agreements will continue until the expiration of the last to expire patent or last to be abandoned patent application that is licensed to us, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the UTB Agreements, which we currently expect will be in 2025. We may terminate the UTB Agreements by providing advance written notice of 60 days as specified in the UTB Agreements. UTB may terminate the UTB Agreements if we violate or fail to perform any terms of the UTB Agreements and we fail to cure such violation or failure within 90 days of notice thereof from UTB. Additionally, if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents, the UTB Agreements will automatically terminate.
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
In June 2012, we entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended in April 2013 and August 2014, and then amended and restated in May 2015, which we refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as the UNC Agreements, with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, or UNC, pursuant to which UNC granted us an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license to develop, manufacture, use, and commercialize products, services and methods, covered by certain patent rights owned by UNC, including patents related to a microfabricated ionization source and a microfabricated ionizer chip.
We issued an aggregate of 110,626 shares of our common stock to UNC, which had an aggregate fair value at the time of issuance of approximately $37,800. Additionally, we must pay UNC a low single digit percentage royalty on our net sales of any products that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to an annual minimum royalty payment of $30,000. We are also obligated to pay UNC a low double-digit percentage of certain royalty income received from our sublicensees. To date, we have not issued any sublicenses under the UNC Agreements.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed Products and achieve defined milestones within the UNC Agreements. There are no future milestone payments to be made by the Company under the UNC Agreements.

We are responsible for all reasonable, documented patent expenses incurred during the life of the UNC Agreements and associated costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecuting, issuance and maintenance of all patent applications and patents included within the patent rights covered by the UNC Agreements. In addition, we have the option to exclusively license UNC rights in improvements to the license patents and related portfolio, by paying $10,000 per improvement.
The UNC Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire patent or last to be abandoned patent application that is licensed to us, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the UNC Agreements. There are current patent applications pending under the UNC Agreements so we expect the UNC Agreements will continue through at least 2039. We may terminate the UNC Agreements by providing advance written notice of 60 days as specified therein. UNC may terminate the UNC Agreements if we violate or fail to perform any terms of the UNC Agreements and we fail to cure such violation or failure within 90 days of notice thereof from UNC.
Regulations
Chemical detection, identification, and authentication technologies are of value to military, governmental, and law enforcement organizations worldwide. As a result, our products and technologies are subject to export control laws and regulations, which are imposed to ensure that sensitive technologies are withheld from unfriendly governments, terrorists or criminal organizations.
Our current products are dual-use items with both military and civilian applications. These products are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, or EAR. The EAR imposes various documentation, recordkeeping and transaction screening requirements and may impose licensing requirements for certain countries, customers, or end-use applications of our products. Applicable U.S. export regulations will continue to apply to our products and technologies even after they are exported to non-U.S. customers or to any non-U.S. subsidiaries or affiliates.
Articles, services and technologies that have certain military applications or that are designed, developed, modified or adapted specifically for military applications may be subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. When ITAR requirements apply, they apply in place of EAR. ITAR imposes registration requirements and broader, more stringent export licensing requirements than EAR. We must determine whether ITAR or EAR governs each of our products, services, and technologies. We may assume the risk of making these determinations on our own, or we may decide to request formal governmental jurisdictional rulings.
Although our current products and services are not subject to ITAR licensing requirements, such licensing requirements could apply to our future products and services.
Under generally applicable U.S. trade regulations administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, we are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions involving sanctioned countries, as well as certain persons and entities that have been designated for targeted sanctions by OFAC. EAR and ITAR also impose export restrictions targeted at identified persons and entities, and we are required to comply with these restrictions as well.
Violations of the ITAR, EAR, and OFAC requirements can result in significant fines, penalties, denial of export privileges, and even terms of imprisonment for the individuals involved.
In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, clearance, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-market monitoring and reporting, and import and export of medical devices. Our products are currently marketed as research use only, or RUO. Products such as ours that are marketed for RUO are not intended for use in a clinical investigation or for clinical diagnostic use outside an investigation and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for RUO and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices more generally,

including the requirements for clearance or approval and compliance with manufacturing requirements known as the Quality System Regulation.
A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act and subject to FDA enforcement activities. RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. The FDA will also evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if the product is intended for diagnostic purposes. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization.
Although we currently market our products as RUO, we may in the future make the decision to market them for clinical or diagnostic purposes, or may develop other different products intended for clinical or diagnostic purposes, which would result in the application of a more onerous set of regulatory requirements.
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 227 full-time employees, of which 79 work in sales, sales support and marketing, 68 work in engineering and research and development, 50 work in manufacturing, operations and service and 30 work in general and administrative. As of December 31, 2022, a substantial majority of our employees were located in the United States. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards. The health and safety of our employees, customers and communities are of primary concern.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in Delaware in 2012 as 908 Devices Inc. Our offices are located at 645 Summer Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210. Our telephone number is (857) 254-1500.
On December 22, 2020, we completed our initial public offering, or IPO, pursuant to which we issued and sold 7,475,000 shares of common stock, inclusive of 975,000 shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds of $136.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs.
On November 15, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering, pursuant to which we issued and sold 3,150,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $32.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $94.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs. 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to (i) engage an independent registered public accounting firm to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, or (iii) disclose certain executive compensation related items.
We may continue to be an “emerging growth company” until December 31, 2025, though we may cease to be an “emerging growth company” earlier under certain circumstances, including if (i) we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue in any fiscal year, (ii) we become a “large accelerated filer” as a result of the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeding $700 million as of any June 30, or (iii) we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.

Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period, provided in Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements and the reported results of operations contained therein may not be directly comparable to those of other public companies.
We are also a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Regulation S-K. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter or (ii) our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. If we are a smaller reporting company at the time, we cease to be an emerging growth company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.
