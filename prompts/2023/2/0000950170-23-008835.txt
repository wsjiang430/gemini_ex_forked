 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to improving the lives of patients, caregivers, and families affected by rare and common neurodegenerative diseases by pursuing the development of disease-modifying therapeutics to restore the vigilance of microglia. Microglia are the sentinel immune cells of the brain and play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) health and responding to damage caused by disease. Leveraging recent research implicating microglial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, we utilize a precision medicine approach to develop a pipeline of therapeutic candidates, initially addressing genetically defined patient subpopulations, that we believe will activate and restore microglial function. Our first therapeutic candidates are designed to activate Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2), a key microglial receptor protein that mediates responses to environmental signals in order to maintain brain health and whose dysfunction is linked to neurodegeneration. We have two main programs that are designed to target TREM2. Our lead product candidate, VGL101, is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) TREM2 agonist (or activator) that is currently being studied in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease. Our second program is focused on small molecule TREM2 agonists and is currently in investigational new drug (IND) enabling studies. We plan to develop our small molecule TREM2 agonist candidates for more common neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglial dysfunction, with an initial focus on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in genetically defined subpopulations.
 We believe that each of the therapeutic candidates in our pipeline has the potential to be developed for multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Our precision medicine approach begins with rare, genetically defined diseases for which microglial dysfunction is believed to be a key driver of disease pathology and then utilizes findings from these efforts to inform expansion into larger and more common neurodegenerative diseases. We believe our strategy has the potential to mitigate downstream translational risk as we seek to advance our programs through early development and into the clinic. We believe this iterative, sequential approach is a key differentiator, potentially allowing us to generate clinical proof-of-concept (PoC) efficiently and leverage our initial development programs as well as research by others, in pursuing additional neurodegenerative disease opportunities.
Our lead product candidate, VGL101, is currently being studied in IGNITE, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with ALSP as well as in an ongoing Phase 1 single and multiple ascending dose (SAD and MAD) healthy volunteer trial.
 In December 2022, we initiated IGNITE, the first-ever interventional trial for ALSP patients. ALSP is a rare, inherited, autosomal dominant neurological disease with high genetic penetrance. ALSP is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R), a receptor that shares a common downstream signaling pathway with TREM2 and affects an estimated 10,000 people in the U.S., with similar prevalence in Europe and Japan. There are currently no approved therapies for ALSP, underscoring the unmet need for people living with this disease. In October 2022, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for VGL101 for the treatment of ALSP. In July 2022, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for VGL101 for the treatment of ALSP. We plan to report six-month interim data from the first six patients enrolled in IGNITE during the second half of 2023.
 We are also conducting a Phase 1 SAD and MAD trial of VGL101 in healthy volunteers in the United States and Australia. In November 2022, we reported interim topline data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of VGL101 in healthy volunteers. As of October 7, 2022, the trial had enrolled 82 healthy volunteers who received either VGL101 (n=68) at various doses up to 40 mg/kg or placebo (n=14). Based on these data, VGL101 was found to be generally well-tolerated at doses up to 40 mg/kg SAD and 20 mg/kg MAD. VGL101 showed a linear, predictable PK profile at all doses and a half-life that supported monthly IV dosing. Importantly, VGL101 achieved dose dependent, durable decreases in levels of soluble TREM2 ("sTREM2") in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) demonstrating proof of target engagement. VGL101 20 mg/kg repeat dosing was associated with robust reduction in sTREM2 levels and decreases were still observed 28 days after the third and final dose. VGL101 is the first antibody reported to demonstrate durability of TREM2 engagement in a clinical setting and showed durable increases in soluble CSF1R ("sCSF1R") levels in the CSF after repeat dosing. As of the date of this report, we have completed dosing SAD cohorts up to 60 mg/kg and have initiated dosing of a 60 mg/kg MAD cohort. We plan to report the full data analysis from the Phase 1 trial during the second half of 2023.

Engagement with our stakeholders, including patients and scientific and provider communities, is central to our approach in rare neurodegenerative diseases. In September 2021, we began ILLUMINATE, a natural history study of ALSP patients to better characterize the patient journey, inform our clinical trial design, and facilitate recruitment into our clinical trials. In December 2022, we reported interim data from the ongoing ILLUMINATE study comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and certain fluid biomarker levels in symptomatic ALSP participants versus prodromal (those with a confirmed CSF1R mutation and MRI findings but showing no clinical symptoms of ALSP) participants. At six months, volumetric MRI findings showed a greater disease progression for symptomatic ALSP participants versus prodromal participants, based on greater reductions in brain tissue volume and greater increases in white matter lesion and ventricular volume. Baseline levels of fluid biomarkers were found to be significantly different for ALSP participants including reduced sCSF1R levels for prodromal and symptomatic individuals versus healthy volunteers, and increased neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels by multiple-fold, indicative of active neurodegeneration, for symptomatic individuals versus prodromal and healthy individuals.
 In addition to ILLUMINATE, we established the world’s first patient-facing ALSP informational website to build disease awareness and actively support patient advocacy organizations. Through this work, we have created a strong global network of key opinion leaders (KOLs), centers of excellence, and genetic counseling practices that each treat ALSP patients and work with families affected by the disease.
 In addition to VGL101, we are developing novel small molecule TREM2 agonists designed to be suitable for oral delivery to treat common neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglial dysfunction, with an initial focus on AD in genetically defined subpopulations. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that a specific mutation in a TREM2 variant (R47H) has one of the strongest associations with the development of AD, second in magnitude only to that associated with the apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) genotype. Our strategy in AD is to initially target genetically defined AD subpopulations with microglia dysregulation including those carrying TREM2 and other variants. Our small molecule product candidates have a different mechanism of action and bind to a different site than VGL101, providing potential additional optionality in positioning these molecules in different patient populations and potential differentiation from TREM2 antibody therapeutics. These highly active, selective and brain-penetrant small molecule agonists are designed to act as a molecular glue that potentiates the TREM2 signaling response to natural damage ligands. Vigil has established that its small molecule agonists demonstrate on-target TREM2 activation across both common and rare TREM2 variants. We plan to submit an IND application and, subject to FDA clearance of the IND, initiate clinical development of our lead small molecule TREM2 agonist candidate in the second half of 2023.
 We believe our microglia focus, precision medicine approach, and pipeline, which spans multiple modalities, strongly position us to become a differentiated leader in the neurodegenerative therapeutic space.
The following table highlights our clinical and preclinical programs.

Over time, we plan to expand our pipeline through internal discovery and development and/or through strategic collaborations or alliances with academic organizations or pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.

Our Business Strategy
Our goal is to be a leader in the development and commercialization of microglia-targeted, disease-modifying therapeutics that slow or halt progression of a range of rare and common neurodegenerative diseases. Key elements of our business strategy are to:
•Apply our precision medicine approach to develop microglia-targeted therapies for patients with rare, genetically defined neurodegenerative diseases and subsequently advance into neurodegenerative diseases affecting larger patient populations. The initial indications we are pursuing are rare diseases that have strong genetic, mechanistic, and biochemical associations with microglial dysfunction. We believe these associations provide a strong rationale for potential intervention with microglia-targeted therapies. By focusing on these known relationships, we believe we may mitigate downstream translational risk as we seek to advance our programs through early development and into the clinic. We expect this approach will allow us to identify biologically and clinically relevant biomarkers and to generate PoC efficiently. We plan to apply the specific learnings from these studies to inform the development of our therapeutic candidates in other neurodegenerative disease indications with broader patient populations. 
 •Advance our lead product candidate, VGL101, a mAb TREM2 agonist, for the treatment of ALSP and other rare leukoencephalopathies and leukodystrophies. We are currently developing VGL101, our fully human mAb that is highly selective for TREM2, for the treatment of ALSP, a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease. We believe there is strong genetic, molecular, and cellular evidence implicating microglial dysfunction and signaling deficiency in ALSP, which we believe could be correctable through TREM2 activation. We believe the significant unmet need and lack of approved therapies in ALSP have the potential to enable a more efficient clinical development path to PoC and regulatory approval, if our trials are successful. We plan to leverage our work in ALSP to target other rare leukoencephalopathies and leukodystrophies, such as cALD, MLD and Krabbe. To that end, VGL101 is currently being studied in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial, IGNITE, in patients with ALSP. We plan to report six-month interim data from the first six patients enrolled in IGNITE during the second half of 2023. In addition, we plan to report the full data analysis from the ongoing Phase 1 trial in the second half of 2023. We continue to enroll people living with ALSP in ILLUMINATE, a natural history study of ALSP patients designed to better characterize the patient journey, inform our clinical trial design, and facilitate recruitment into our clinical trials. 
 •Develop a novel, orally-available, small molecule TREM2 agonist program for the treatment of more common neurodegenerative diseases, beginning with genetically defined subpopulations of AD patients. Peer reviewed literature suggests a strong genetic association between certain TREM2 variants and the development and progression of AD. We believe our precision medicine approach will enable us to identify subpopulations of AD patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment with a small molecule TREM2 agonist and as such, we are advancing our novel, orally-available, small molecule TREM2 agonist the treatment of AD, beginning with genetically defined populations associated with TREM2 gene variants. An orally available and highly active, TREM2-selective and CNS penetrant small molecule with a novel mechanism of action has many potential clinical and commercial advantages in large chronic indications, including ease of administration and use in outpatient settings. We also intend to explore the potential of our small molecule agonist for the general AD population, if clinical data support this approach. We plan to submit an IND application and, subject to FDA clearance of the IND, initiate clinical development of our lead small molecule TREM2 agonist candidate in the second half of 2023. 
 •Engage the stakeholder community including patients, advocacy groups, and clinical leaders. Support of the stakeholder community is an integral part of our mission to bring microglia-targeted therapeutics to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Early and ongoing engagement increases our understanding of the patient journey, helps build disease awareness, and facilitates recruitment of patients and clinicians to participate in clinical trials. For example, we actively support the first and only ALSP dedicated patient organization, Sisters’ Hope Foundation, and launched the world’s first patient-facing ALSP informational website, to increase ALSP awareness, engage with and support patients, the clinical community, and other relevant stakeholders. Beyond developing an ALSP KOL network and forming our Patient and Caregiver Advisory Council (PCAC), we have also partnered with broader leukodystrophy and rare disease umbrella organizations, such as United Leukodystrophy Foundation, Hunter's Hope, ALEX The Leukodystrophy Charity, National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD), Global Genes, and Every Life Foundation. 


•Expand our modality-agnostic product pipeline to other microglial targets beyond TREM2. Given the central role that microglia play in maintaining brain health, we plan to explore targets beyond TREM2 for the development of therapeutics that modulate microglial activity across multiple modalities for the treatment of additional neurodegenerative diseases. We plan to regularly evaluate opportunities to expand and diversify our pipeline through internal discovery and development and/or through strategic collaborations or alliances with academic organizations or pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.
 Microglia and Their Role in CNS Health and Neurodegeneration
Microglia are the sentinel immune cells of the brain and play a critical role in maintaining CNS health, or homeostasis, and responding to damage caused by disease. In recent years, the scientific community’s understanding of microglia’s role in brain health and neurodegeneration has advanced markedly. A 2020 review in the journal Science, for example, highlighted microglia’s “fundamental role” as “governors of neuronal function and homeostasis in the adult brain.” In their homeostatic state, microglia monitor for potential damage. Microglia sense multiple types of signals in the brain, including those generated by infection, cell death and breakdown, and replacement of myelin (sheaths of protein and fat that insulate axon fibers that turn over as part of normal brain physiology). Homeostatic microglia transition to a disease-associated microglia ("DAM") phenotype and then coordinate signal-specific downstream responses, such as potentiation of microglial survival and proliferation, activation of microglial phagocytosis (cellular debris removal by innate immune cells), removal of unneeded neural connections (axonal pruning) to maintain synaptic health, and stimulation of microglial lysosomal function, and lipid and cholesterol metabolism.
Recent studies have shown that DAM possess neuroprotective disease-preventing effects. DAM are not associated with any specific primary cause of disease pathology or disease etiology, but rather display a protective phenotype that maintains the anti-inflammatory CNS environment and removes protein clumps and cellular debris that accumulate in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and during normal aging. Microglia maintain homeostasis in healthy areas of the brain by preventing accumulation of debris resulting from normal brain maintenance and thus preventing initiation of neuroinflammation and neuropathology. For example, in AD animal model studies, DAM congregate and form a protective barrier at sites of neuroinflammatory lesions and around neurotoxic plaques, which are aggregates of ß-amyloid protein.
The essential role played by microglia in maintaining brain health is exemplified by diseases of the white matter, such as leukoencephalopathies and leukodystrophies. In these diseases, microglial dysfunction directly affects neuronal function and white matter integrity. White matter consists of bundles of axon fibers wrapped in myelin sheaths that project from neurons and transmit signals across the brain. The bundles of myelin sheaths appear white and together are called white matter. Debris from the maintenance and regeneration of myelin sheaths must be cleared away by DAM to prevent inflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration. Microglial dysfunction and the resulting build-up of inflammatory myelin debris in these diseases leads to destruction of the white matter and the breakdown of the blood brain barrier, which can allow disruptive infiltration of inflammatory cells that further drive disease progression. Therefore, we believe treatments that prevent long term microglial dysfunction could prevent failure of the blood brain barrier and the resulting devastating inflammation that leads to neurodegeneration.
In more common neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, evidence suggests that microglia dysfunction is present in genetically defined subpopulations. Similar to leukoencephalopathies and leukodystrophies, failure of microglia to remove debris, in this case protein clumps, is believed to lead to degeneration of vulnerable neuronal subtypes. Restoring microglial function could prevent the expansion of ß-amyloid plaque and slow down the neurodegenerative process in these subpopulations.
Our initial focus on microglia and microglia-targeted therapeutics is based on research linking microglia to both rare and common neurodegenerative diseases that either result from genetic mutations or are associated with genetic variations. These conditions include leukoencephalopathies and leukodystrophies, a set of rare, mainly genetic disorders affecting neurons and white matter, such as ALSP, cALD, MLD, Krabbe, as well as genetic subpopulations of AD carrying variants affecting microglial function. Due to their multiple functions, microglia are also implicated in other CNS diseases, including AD, FTD, MS, PD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and certain rare epilepsies.

Genomic analyses have shown that genetic mutations or variations that affect microglial physiology predispose individuals to neuroimmune dysfunction and neurodegeneration. As a result, the brain’s immune function, orchestrated by microglia, deteriorates, and subsequently fails to carry out critical activities, which include:
•clearing pathological neurodegenerative protein aggregates, such as those that accumulate in AD, to prevent accumulation and subsequent neuroinflammation; 
 •providing metabolic and functional support to maintain healthy nerve cells; 
 •regulating connections between nerve cells; 
 •removing white matter debris to prevent inflammation; and 
 •maintaining blood brain barrier integrity and regulating neurovascular function. 
 As illustrated in Figure 1 below, diseases colored in green represent our current focus areas, while diseases colored in purple represent potential future therapeutic opportunities for modulating microglial function.

 TREM2: Our Initial Therapeutic Target
Our most advanced therapeutic programs are aimed at developing agonists of TREM2, a membrane spanning receptor expressed specifically on microglia in the brain. TREM2 is essential for microglia’s homeostatic maintenance functions and response to inflammatory CNS damage in various disease states. TREM2 acts like a sensor to detect cellular damage in the brain, such as from dead neurons and myelin debris (cellular debris), and protein clumps that form plaques. Once microglia encounter damage associated materials, TREM2 mediates signals for the microglia to respond appropriately, for example, by transitioning to DAM, migrating to sites of damage, clearing away debris through phagocytosis, and acting as a barrier to prevent further damage (Figure 2). In preclinical studies across multiple neurodegenerative conditions, it has been shown that the transition from homeostatic microglia to fully activated DAM requires activation of the TREM2 receptor.

Figure 2: TREM2 Receptor Activation is Required for Homeostatic Microglia to Transition to DAM


a.Homeostatic microglia sense debris. B. Microglia transitions to DAM through binding of cellular debris to TREM2, leading to debris removal. C. TREM2 loss-of-function results in dysfunctional microglia, unable to transition to DAM, leading to accumulation of cellular debris, neuroinflammation, and subsequent neurodegeneration. 
 TREM2’s protective role in neurodegenerative disease was discovered through GWAS. This finding was confirmed and extended through transgenic animal studies and single cell RNA sequencing analyses. TREM2 signals through an associated protein complex, which triggers a cascade of biochemical changes that maintain microglial homeostasis and promote microglial migration to sites of injury, activate phagocytosis, and promote cell survival and proliferation.
Figure 3A below shows the TREM2 receptor and the key components of the associated protein complex, including a membrane protein called DNAX-activating protein of 12 kilodaltons (DAP12), which is associated with TREM2, and consists of an intracellular region, called ITAM, and intracellular proteins called SRC and SYK. As shown in Figure 3B, when adjacent TREM2 receptors recognize and bind to damage-associated materials, such as cell debris, the TREM2 receptors cluster. This triggers the phosphorylation, defined as a molecular modification involving addition of a phosphate group, of DAP12 at its ITAM region by SRC. Each phosphorylated ITAM region then binds to SYK, which relays the receptor signals within the cell. SYK also becomes phosphorylated after binding to relay the signal for initiating biochemical changes in the cell to promote microglial survival, proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis, and regulate inflammation and lipid metabolism.

Figure 3: TREM2 is an Environmental Sensor, Which Binds to Damage- or Infection-associated Materials, such as Cell Debris, Triggering its Activation




Multiple clinical trials have shown that TREM2 deficiency is a driver of neurodegeneration, and we believe such studies provide a compelling rationale for therapeutically activating TREM2 signaling to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Loss-of-function mutations of TREM2, such as those associated with AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, disrupt signaling through reduced binding to brain debris and reduced TREM2 levels at the cell surface. The following findings further support the link between TREM2 loss-of-function and disease:
•The importance of TREM2 in the CNS and its involvement in microglial dysfunction comes directly from a devastating human genetic disease called Nasu-Hakola disease (NHD). NHD is an autosomal recessive disorder, caused by a defect in two gene copies, that renders the receptor non-functional due to TREM2 or DAP12 mutations. Clinically, NHD is characterized by a rapidly progressive and fatal adult-onset leukodystrophy with a predominantly cognitive phenotype directly caused by microglial dysfunction. 


•TREM2 loss-of-function variants are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, FTD, ALS, and AD. For example, GWAS have shown that a specific mutation in a TREM2 variant (R47H) has one of the strongest associations with the development of AD, second in magnitude only to that associated with the apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) genotype. 
 •Functionally, TREM2 mutations drive disease pathology in multiple animal studies, such as studies for AD, stroke, MS, and other white matter diseases. For example, in an AD mouse study, microglial inactivation via TREM2 deletion enhanced the spreading of both pathological ß-amyloid and tau proteins. 
 In our preclinical studies to date, we have not observed any adverse effects resulting from TREM2 agonism. To our knowledge, no association has been established between gain-of-function mutations for TREM2 and any disease. Data in animal studies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases suggest that chronic treatment with a TREM2 agonist has the potential to ameliorate AD pathology.
Our Precision Medicine Approach to Development
We are pursuing a precision medicine approach to developing a broad range of therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. We believe that each of the drugs in our pipeline can be developed for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, some of which have very large patient populations. Our development strategy is to begin with rare, genetically defined diseases for which microglial dysfunction is a key driver of disease pathology and to use findings from these efforts to inform expansion into larger and more common neurodegenerative indications. We believe this iterative, sequential approach is a key differentiator which will help reduce downstream translational risk and potentially allow us to generate clinical PoC efficiently and leverage our initial development programs as well as research by others in pursuing additional neurodegenerative disease opportunities. We also believe we are differentiated by developing both large molecule (i.e., injectable) antibodies as well as small molecule (i.e., orally available) drugs.
 We are executing on this approach with our lead product candidate, VGL101, which is initially being developed for the treatment of ALSP. ALSP has strong genetic, mechanistic, and biochemical associations with microglial dysfunction. The understanding of the genetic defect, the molecular pathway deficit, the potential for TREM2 agonism to mitigate the deficit, and the availability of both target engagement and disease biomarkers, serve to increase our confidence in our efforts to rapidly achieve clinical PoC for VGL101 for this disease. We believe the significant unmet need and lack of approved therapies in ALSP have the potential to enable a more efficient clinical development path to PoC and regulatory approval, if these trials are successful. We plan to leverage our work in ALSP to target other rare leukoencephalopathies and leukodystrophies, such as cALD, MLD and Krabbe.
We are developing orally-available small molecules that we believe may have potential clinical and commercial advantages, including ease of administration, improved treatment compliance, and use in outpatient settings. We believe our small molecule TREM2 agonist candidates could be particularly impactful for treating diseases with larger patient populations, such as AD. Our precision medicine strategy in AD is to initially target genetically defined AD subpopulations with microglia dysregulation including those carrying TREM2 and other variants.
 Our Product Development Programs
We currently have two programs aimed at developing microglia-targeted TREM2 agonists for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including VGL101, our fully human mAb TREM2 agonist and a small molecule TREM2 agonist program.
VGL101, Monoclonal Antibody TREM2 Agonist Candidate
 Our lead candidate, VGL101, is a highly-targeted fully human monoclonal antibody directed against human TREM2 for the treatment of rare genetically defined microgliopathies. VGL101 is currently being studied in IGNITE, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with ALSP. We plan to report six-month interim data from the first six patients enrolled in IGNITE during the second half of 2023.
 On November 2, 2022, we reported interim topline data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of VGL101 in healthy volunteers. As of October 7, 2022, the trial had enrolled 82 healthy volunteers who received either VGL101 (n=68) at various doses up to 40 mg/kg or placebo (n=14). Based on these data, VGL101 was found to be generally well-tolerated at doses up to 40 mg/kg SAD and 20 mg/kg MAD. VGL101 showed a linear, predictable PK profile

at all doses and a half-life that supports monthly IV dosing. Importantly, VGL101 achieved dose dependent, durable decreases in levels of sTREM2 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) demonstrating proof of target engagement. VGL101 20 mg/kg repeat dosing was associated with robust reduction in sTREM2 levels and decreases were still observed 28 days after the third and final dose. VGL101 is the first antibody reported to demonstrate durability of TREM2 engagement in a clinical setting and showed durable increases in sCSF1R levels in the CSF after repeat dosing. As of the date of this report, we have completed dosing SAD cohorts up to 60 mg/kg and have initiated dosing of a 60 mg/kg MAD cohort. We plan to report the full data analysis from the Phase 1 trial in the second half of 2023.
 Our First VGL101 Indication—ALSP
ALSP is a rare, inherited, autosomal dominant neurological disease with high penetrance. Because ALSP is autosomal dominant, the disease requires a mutation in only one of two gene copies in order to develop. It is caused by a mutation of the CSF1R gene and affects approximately 10,000 people in the U.S., with an estimated incidence of about 1,000 to 2,000 new cases annually. ALSP has been diagnosed in countries around the world, with major clusters in North and South America, Central and Northern Europe, and Asia. In October 2022, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for VGL101 for the treatment of ALSP. In July 2022, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for VGL101 for the treatment of ALSP.
 ALSP was only recently recognized as a distinct disease in 2012. Initial symptoms of the disease, at times, resemble other neurodegenerative disorders, such as FTD, MS and AD, leading to misdiagnoses. Therefore, we believe the published prevalence figures may underrepresent the ALSP patient population. With the recent availability of genetic testing for CSF1R mutations and disease awareness-building efforts by us and patient advocacy groups, we expect the number of diagnoses to increase.
The disease generally presents in adults in their forties, is diagnosed through genetic testing for CSF1R mutations and established clinical/radiologic criteria, and is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and motor impairment. These devastating symptoms typically exhibit rapid progression and those affected have an average life expectancy of approximately six to seven years following symptom onset.
To our knowledge, there are no approved products for ALSP, and beyond VGL101, there are none in clinical development, underlining the high unmet need in this rare indication. Academic investigators have tried hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a small number of patients. In a published report on seven patients followed for a median period of 11 months, although the investigators reported some improvements, all patients experienced some level of disease progression as well as MRI lesion progression with three patients experiencing graft versus host disease and one death in addition to other side effects. Off-label use of symptomatic treatments (e.g., anti-Parkinsonian drugs) appear to provide minimal benefit to patients with ALSP.
ALSP is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CSF1R gene, which lead to microglial dysfunction. CSF1R+/- microglia, which lack one copy of functional or wild-type CSF1R, fail to perform homeostatic functions, such as phagocytosis and removal of myelin debris, as well as maintenance of synaptic health by axonal pruning. This microglial dysfunction leads to loss of oligodendrocytes, as well as axonal damage, manifesting as demyelination, axonal spheroids, and a devastating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory phenotype. ALSP patients experience both microglial loss and dysfunction in the white matter regions of the brain. As disease progression accelerates, the blood brain barrier function becomes compromised and peripheral immune cells infiltrate into the brain, contributing to the pro-inflammatory pathophysiology of ALSP.
Treatment Rationale for VGL101
We believe that VGL101 has the potential to be a treatment for ALSP because CSF1R and TREM2 share a common downstream signaling pathway. As shown in Figure 4 below, both cell surface receptors transmit their biological effects, including cell survival and proliferation signals, through the same signaling partner, DAP12/SYK.
Figure 4: CSF1R and TREM2 Share a Common Signaling Pathway


TREM2’s signaling for phagocytosis and cell motility is also transmitted through DAP12/SYK. The upstream biology of CSF1R and TREM2 is distinct, with CSF1R responding to either of two growth factors, CSF1 and IL34, a cytokine that elicits its activity by binding to CSF1R, for cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation, while TREM2 is activated by a broad array of damage-associated cellular debris, as part of its sensor function.
VGL101 is designed to increase signaling through DAP12/SYK to compensate for CSF1R loss-of-function by mitigating microglial dysfunction. Human genetics have demonstrated the impact of deficient signaling through TREM2 or DAP12/SYK in the rare, fatal genetic disease, NHD, which is caused by mutations in TREM2 or DAP12, resulting in the complete loss of their signaling function. The disease presentation, imaging findings, and brain pathology of ALSP and NHD are similar, highlighting that converging, dysfunctional biochemical pathways produce similar pathobiology. For example, both NHD and ALSP are fatal, rapidly progressing disorders that produce FTD-like symptoms that first appear in the thirties in the case of NHD, and forties for ALSP. Both are characterized by chronic loss of myelin and loss of axons, nerve fibers that transmit electrical signals away from nerve cells and which are the primary constituents of white matter. The white matter brain lesions resulting from both diseases have a similar distribution.
 Mutations in CSF1R that result in the development of ALSP cause the loss of proper receptor signaling, reducing microglia cell numbers and impairing their activity in several of the affected white matter and cortical regions (Figure 5A). As seen in Figure 5B below, brain tissue from ALSP patients showed a reduction in the number of microglia as compared with normal tissue, as measured by a microglial marker, IBA-1. Brain tissue from ALSP patients also showed decreased levels of microglial-specific RNA transcripts compared with healthy tissue, as evidenced by the downregulation of key microglial homeostatic genes such as IBA-1, P2RY12 and CX3CR1. Several academic groups have demonstrated the loss of microglia (decreased staining for IBA-1 positive cells) in the grey and white matter regions of ALSP brain tissue, implicating ALSP as a primary microgliopathy (Figure 5C).

We have demonstrated proof-of-mechanism in in vitro studies that model CSF1R loss-of-function in ALSP. For these studies, we used human microglia derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and are dependent on the growth factor CSF1 for survival and differentiation.
As illustrated in Figure 6A, we demonstrated VGL101 rescue of CSF1R deficiency resulting from treatment with PLX5622, a selective CSF1R inhibitor. Microglia treated with PLX5622 alone displayed significantly reduced viability compared to untreated cells. Exposure of PLX5622-treated cultures to VGL101 rescued the cells from effects of CSF1R inhibition and restored viability. In Figure 6B, microglia cultured in media from which CSF1 has been withdrawn did not exhibit normal elongated rod-like structures. When microglia grown in media without CSF1 were exposed to VGL101, they displayed morphology typical of healthy microglia with elongated rod-like structures demonstrating an ability to rescue morphological changes caused by CSF1 deficiency. We have also shown VGL101’s ability to rescue viability and suppress apoptosis of microglia cultured in media without CSF1.

(A) iPSC-derived microglia grown in media treated with control (Vehicle), CSF1R inhibitor alone (PLX5622), CSF1R inhibitor plus immunoglobulin G control (PLX5622+IgG), or CSF1R inhibitor plus VGL101 (PLX5622+VGL101) were measured for microglia viability compared to Vehicle (Microglia Viability (% of Vehicle)), ****: p<0.0001; (B) iPSC-derived microglia grown in media containing CSF1 and IL-34 (Control Media) and media depleted of CSF1 and IL-34 (Withdrawal Media) with no treatment, IgG control and VGL101 were evaluated for microglia morphology – white arrowheads indicate elongated rod-like morphology of pharmacologically rescued microglia.
 We believe that there are quantifiable, disease-associated biomarkers which correlate with disease progression and could be used to detect treatment effects in ALSP clinical trials. Published data indicate that MRI of brain lesions could correlate with disease progression, and fluid biomarkers such as NfL, an axonal protein, for which detection in the blood or CSF can be quantitatively indicative of white matter degeneration in ALSP. Interim data from our ongoing natural history study in ALSP, ILLUMINATE, also support the utility of MRI and NfL as biomarkers for disease progression and treatment effect. After six months, MRI volumetric analyses showed numerically greater reductions in the volume of frontal and parietal regions, and corpus callosum, and greater expansion in volume of white matter lesion and ventricle in ILLUMINATE participants with symptomatic ALSP versus prodromal participants indicating greater disease progression in symptomatic participants over six months. Additionally, fluid biomarker analyses at baseline showed that symptomatic and prodromal participants exhibited significantly lower levels of sCSF1R in the blood versus healthy individuals, indicating presence of defective microglia. Notably, blood and CSF levels of NfL in symptomatic participants were higher by multiple-fold versus prodromal participants and healthy individuals at baseline, indicating significant neurodegeneration. We believe these data from ILLUMINATE on

MRI and fluid biomarkers support their utility as early indicators of VGL101’s therapeutic response and PoC in our Phase 2 trial, IGNITE, in ALSP. Along with the high unmet need in the disease, we believe the availability of these quantifiable biomarkers make ALSP an attractive initial indication for VGL101.
VGL101 Clinical Development Plan for ALSP
•ILLUMINATE, ALSP Natural History Study: In 2021, we began a non-interventional natural history study, named ILLUMINATE, with the objectives of further understanding the phenotype and natural course of the disease, the patient journey and treatment paradigm, as well as further developing, and evaluating biomarkers and potential clinical outcome measures and potentially serving as a contemporaneous external comparator arm. Patients who participate in our natural history study may also participate in our interventional clinical trials. In December 2022, we reported interim data from the ongoing ILLUMINATE study showing that at six months, volumetric MRI findings showed a greater disease progression for symptomatic ALSP participants versus prodromal participants based on greater reductions in brain tissue volume and greater increases in white matter lesion and ventricular volume. Baseline levels of fluid biomarkers were found to be significantly different for ALSP participants including reduced sCSF1R levels for prodromal and symptomatic individuals versus healthy volunteers, and increased NfL levels by multiple-fold, indicative of active neurodegeneration, for symptomatic individuals versus prodromal and healthy individuals.
 •Phase 1 Healthy Volunteer Trial: This clinical trial is designed as a SAD/MAD trial of VGL101 in healthy volunteers, including subjects of various ethnic backgrounds, to evaluate safety and tolerability as well as measure biomarkers to confirm target engagement such as sCSF1R, sTREM2 and induced microglial factors found in the CSF. We submitted our IND for the Phase 1 trial in 2021 and received clearance from the FDA to dose healthy volunteers in our Phase 1 SAD/MAD clinical trial at doses up to 20 mg/kg as a result of a partial clinical hold placed by the FDA. We initiated our Phase 1 trial in the U.S. in December 2021. In June 2022, we announced that we received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia to initiate a Phase 1 trial of VGL101 in healthy volunteers at doses above 20 mg/kg in Australia. In November 2022, we reported interim topline data from the ongoing Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of VGL101 in healthy volunteers. As of October 7, 2022, the trial had enrolled 82 healthy volunteers who received either VGL101 (n=68) at various doses up to 40 mg/kg or placebo (n=14). Based on these data, VGL101 was found to be generally well-tolerated at doses up to 40 mg/kg SAD and 20 mg/kg MAD. VGL101 showed a linear, predictable PK profile at all doses and a half-life that supports monthly IV dosing. Importantly, VGL101 achieved dose dependent, durable decreases in levels of sTREM2 in the CSF demonstrating proof of target engagement. 20 mg/kg repeat dosing ofVGL101 was associated with robust reduction in sTREM2 levels and decreases were still observed 28 days after the third and final dose. VGL101 is the first antibody reported to demonstrate durability of TREM2 engagement in a clinical setting and showed durable increases in sCSF1R levels in the CSF after repeat dosing. As of the date of this report, we have completed dosing SAD cohorts up to 60 mg/kg and have initiated dosing of a 60 mg/kg MAD cohort. We plan to report the full data analysis from the Phase 1 trial in the second half of 2023. Although we believe that 20 mg/kg is a clinically-relevant dose in ALSP, we continue to engage with the FDA regarding the partial clinical hold at doses above 20 mg/kg to maintain optionality to support patients across other potential indications.
 •IGNITE, Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trial in ALSP: In December 2022, we initiated IGNITE, the first-ever interventional trial for ALSP patients. The IGNITE trial is a global Phase 2, open-label proof-of-concept trial, designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VGL101 in up to 15 patients with symptomatic ALSP and have a CSF1R gene mutation. Secondary outcome assessments include the effects of VGL101 on MRI and biomarkers of neurodegeneration and target engagement. Exploratory outcome assessments include the evaluation of clinical efficacy measures using standard cognitive, motor and functional assessments as well as assessment of the PK of VGL101 in patients with ALSP. Patients enrolled in the trial will receive an intravenous, (IV) infusion of 20 mg/kg of VGL101 approximately every four weeks, for a treatment duration of one year. We plan to report six-month interim data from the first six patients enrolled in IGNITE during the second half of 2023.
 Patient Engagement and Recruitment
We have created a strong global network of KOLs, centers of excellence, and genetic counseling practices that each treat ALSP patients and work with families affected by the disease. These span all geographies but are mainly focused in areas where ALSP clusters have been identified (North America, Europe, and Asia).

We have launched the world’s first patient-facing ALSP informational website and actively support the first and only patient advocacy organization dedicated to ALSP, the Sisters’ Hope Foundation. Strong partnerships with patient organizations like Sisters’ Hope Foundation enable us to learn more about ALSP on a continuous basis and deepen our relationship with the community. We have also partnered with genetic testing companies to increase disease awareness and help with patient engagement for upcoming clinical trials.
We are also partnering with larger leukodystrophy umbrella organizations, including the United Leukodystrophy Foundation, Hunter's Hope and ALEX The Leukodystrophy Charity, as well as rare disease umbrella organizations such as National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD), Global Genes and the Every Life Foundation to provide disease education and raise awareness of ALSP.
We have formed a PCAC consisting of members who can provide a well-rounded patient and caregiver perspective. The PCAC will offer guidance on elements of the patient experience to help us embed the patient voice and insights into all aspects of our clinical program.
We play a central role in the development of an ALSP KOL network to support global collaboration. We intend for this organized KOL network to focus on streamlining and building consensus around disease status definitions and disease measurement tools, as well as working on ways to educate neurologists to recognize and test for the relevant gene mutation.
Through these efforts, we have identified a significant number of symptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and asymptomatic carriers of CSF1R mutations, which we anticipate will facilitate recruitment into our clinical program.
Indication Expansion in Rare Leukodystrophies
According to the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, leukodystrophies include more than 50 rare, genetic disorders that selectively affect the CNS’ white matter, and are typically caused by defects that affect its generation, maintenance, and repair. Collectively, they afflict approximately 99,000 people in the U.S.
We plan to pursue additional indications in this space, where a breakdown of healthy microglial function acts as either a driver or a contributor to the neurodegenerative process. Operationally, our decisions are informed by the availability of translational tools, overall disease profile, medical need and clinical development tractability, competition, and commercial feasibility. From a mechanistic perspective, our approach is to prioritize target indications which TREM2 agonists can potentially address.
We have identified several white matter diseases as potential therapeutic opportunities that share similar characteristics with ALSP and appear to be driven by either peroxisomal or lysosomal deficits such as cALD, MLD, and Krabbe. Our hypothesis is that we can restore microglial function resulting from loss-of-function mutations with TREM2 agonists in these diseases.
 Small Molecule TREM2 Agonists for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases
We are advancing our novel, orally-available, small molecule TREM2 agonist program for the treatment of more common neurodegenerative diseases, beginning with genetically defined AD populations associated with TREM2 gene variants. An orally available, highly active, TREM2-selective and CNS penetrant small molecule with a novel mechanism of action has many potential clinical and commercial advantages in large chronic indications, including ease of administration and use in outpatient settings. We also intend to explore the potential of our small molecule agonist for the general AD population, if clinical data support this approach. In 2022, we initiated IND-enabling studies for this program. We plan to submit an IND application and, subject to FDA clearance of the IND, initiate clinical development of our lead small molecule TREM2 agonist candidate in the second half of 2023.
 Our Small Molecule TREM2 Agonist Program
We have demonstrated in preclinical studies that our small molecule TREM2 agonist candidates are highly selective activators of TREM2, and which we believe are highly CNS penetrant to facilitate blood brain barrier crossing after oral dosing.


Based on our pre-clinical data, we believe the physiochemical and pharmacological attributes of certain of our small molecule TREM2 candidates make them promising for further drug development, including oral bioavailability, preclinical safety profile, pharmacokinetics supporting once-daily dosing regimen and in vivo pharmacodynamics supporting target engagement and potential pharmacological effect.
Our small molecule TREM2 agonists exhibit low single-digit nanomolar potency in in vitro assays measuring TREM2 activation in microglia derived from human iPSCs. Additionally, they retain similar levels of activity across key genetic variants of TREM2 believed to be associated with increased AD risks, thereby enabling Vigil’s precision-based approach involving initial evaluation of our small molecule TREM2 agonists in genetically defined AD segments. Our small molecule TREM2 agonists are highly selective for primate TREM2 as they do not bind to or activate human TREM1 or rodent TREM2 in in vitro assays involving human iPSC-derived microglia and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells.
Our data suggest that our small molecule TREM2 agonists function through a novel mechanism of action based on a series of biochemical, structural and molecular biology experiments we have conducted. They bind to a different site from antibody TREM2 agonists and act as molecular glue to promote receptor complex clustering required for TREM2 activation and signaling. Additionally, they potentiate the response of TREM2 to natural damage ligands, thereby potentially sensitizing TREM2 in microglia to its damage-associated ligands. Figure 7 shows dose-dependent amplification on TREM2 signaling by one of our small molecule agonists in the presence of sulfatide, a natural TREM2 ligand, at various concentrations. This synergistic interaction between our small molecule TREM2 agonists and damage-associated ligands enables greater specificity in disease states, which may support lower doses and contribute to favorable tolerability profile.
 Figure 7: Vigil’s small molecule agonists potentiate TREM2 response to damage-associated ligands
 
Cultured human iPSC-derived microglia were co-stimulated with varying nanomolar concentrations (nM, x-axis) of a brain-extracted sulfoglycolipid TREM2 ligand, Sulfatide, in the absence (pink) or presence of varying levels of Vigil small molecule (SM) TREM2 agonist (cyan curves). To quantify small molecule potentiation of TREM2 signaling, data were normalized to and expressed as the % of maximal pSYK level induced by Sulfatide stimulation in the absence of TREM2 SM agonism (0 nM set as 100%).
 Further in vivo pharmacological characterization of our small molecule TREM2 agonists show they recapitulated the agonist effects observed with an antibody TREM2 agonist in a mouse model for AD. We have demonstrated unbiased correlation across several hundreds of brain markers between our small molecule agonist and VGL101, including the same set of neuroprotective genes seen with VGL101 administration. These data indicate that Vigil’s orally available small molecule agonists were able to deliver in vivo TREM2 responses within the CNS at a magnitude and specificity similar to VGL101.


We have also conducted translational studies with non-human primates, focusing on CSF target engagement biomarkers for clinical assessment such as sTREM2. Figure 8 demonstrates CSF target engagement in non-human primates seen as the significant reduction in sTREM2, following a single oral administration of one of our small molecule TREM2 agonists, starting at very low dose levels. These data support the use of a target engagement biomarker for clinical development of our small molecule TREM2 agonists.
 Figure 8: Oral dosing of Vigil’s small molecule agonist in non-human demonstrates CNS activity via reduction of sTREM2 in CSF
 
Non-human primates were administered with a single oral dose of our small molecule TREM2 agonist and the level of sTREM2 in the CSF was measured as a percentage change over baseline (y-axis) over time (x-axis).
 Our Small Molecule TREM2 Agonist Clinical Strategy
Our strategy in AD is to follow a precision medicine approach that first establishes the role of TREM2-mediated microglial dysregulation in the pathogenesis of AD within certain genetically defined patient subpopulations, which includes TREM2 and other variants. We plan to submit an IND application and, subject to FDA clearance of the IND, initiate clinical development of our lead small molecule TREM2 agonist candidate in the second half of 2023. We anticipate initiating clinical development with a first-in-human Phase 1 SAD and MAD trial in healthy volunteers in the second half of 2023. Following successful completion of our Phase 1 trial, we plan to conduct a comparative biomarker assessment of these patient subpopulations. We believe this approach will reduce translational risk and optimize the selection of the initial patient population recruited for a Phase 2 trial that would evaluate our small molecule TREM agonist program in genetically-defined AD patient populations.
 Overview of Alzheimer’s Disease
AD is the most common cause of dementia, a general term for the loss of memory and other cognitive abilities severe enough to interfere with daily life. AD accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases, and the majority of people with AD are aged 65 and older. A progressive disease, AD usually presents with mild memory loss and progresses to include disorientation, loss of initiative or judgment, difficulty with self-care, behavioral problems, and general mental decline. People aged 65 and older survive an average of four to eight years after diagnosis, with some living as long as 20 years. These data reflect the slow, uncertain progression of the disease, which is the sixth-leading cause of death in the U.S.

The Alzheimer’s Association estimates that 6.5 million people in the U.S. are living with AD in 2022. By 2050, this number is projected to rise to nearly 13 million. The costs of health care and long-term care for people with AD to our healthcare system are substantial. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, the aggregate cost of AD and other dementias is expected to be $321 billion in 2022, and this number could increase to nearly $1 trillion by 2050.
TREM2 in Alzheimer’s Disease
Loss-of-function TREM2 variants occur in seven to eight percent of the AD population and are linked to both disease progression and worsened patient outcomes. Several genetic variants in TREM2 have emerged from GWAS that significantly increase AD risk by two- to four- fold, an increase in risk comparable to that associated with having one copy of ApoE4. The most common and most well-studied TREM2 variant known to increase the risk of AD is the R47H variant. The R47H variant, which represents two to three percent of the AD population, has been reported to triple AD risk in GWAS and is associated with a 23% more rapid progression of dementia compared with non-variant carriers. Other TREM2 variants have also been implicated as risk factors for developing AD, including R62H, H157Y and T96K, all of which are loss-of-function variants.
 Our understanding of the role of microglial dysfunction in plaque development in AD is based on the observation that normally functioning microglia reduce levels of toxic amyloid plaques in the brain, while increasing the number of inert, dense core plaques. In addition, normal TREM2 function is required to prevent AD-associated tau protein aggregates from forming. AD models have shown that TREM2 plays a protective role throughout all stages of disease progression.
In AD patients carrying the R47H TREM2 variant, the number of microglia associated with amyloid-ß plaques is reduced, indicating a defect in responding to damage signals from plaque. R47H TREM2 AD patients also experienced more rapid disease progression and a greater number of co-morbidities, such as a neuropathological protein accumulation, called -synucleinopathy.
The impaired barrier function with R47H TREM2 and Trem2 knock-out is further demonstrated in an AD mouse model which induces AD neuropathology such as amyloid-ß plaques and neuronal dysfunction. Microglia from Trem2 knock-out mice failed to form a protective barrier around amyloid-ß plaque (blue) to reduce regional amyloid neurotoxicity, compared to control (Trem2+/+) mice. The barrier defect in microglia from R47H TREM2 mice is correlated with increased neuritic dystrophy, and filamentous, neurotoxic amyloid-ß plaques and conversely, with relatively reduced inert, non-neurotoxic plaque. This pathobiology is thought to be due to defective responses to damage signals caused by reduced TREM2-ligand interactions and an inability of microglia to convert to the DAM state. The neuropathology induced in this AD mouse model, which is more enhanced with R47H TREM2 due to its reduction of function (as compared to CV TREM2), was ameliorated by treatment with a TREM2 agonist antibody.
Additionally, AD model mice demonstrated stepwise reduction of Trem2 levels that were correlated with increased neuropathology, as measured by tau accumulation and amyloid-ß pathology in the brains of mice. These results provide strong evidence that TREM2 restrains the accumulation of tau in the presence of amyloid-ß pathology. The failure of Trem2-/- microglia to restrain tau accumulation is thought to be driven by their inability to transition to the neuroprotective TREM2-dependent DAM state. We believe TREM2 agonism has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit against tau accumulation, which is believed to occur in the later stages of AD.
We believe the robust body of experimental and genetic evidence points to TREM2 as a key modulator of amyloidosis and tauopathy, and that activating TREM2 has potential to provide disease modifying benefit to those living with AD.
Material Agreements
To enhance and further exploit our product candidates, we have and may continue to enter into research, development, or commercialization agreements with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for complementary or new technologies.
Exclusive License Agreement with Amgen Inc.
In July 2020, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Amgen Inc., pursuant to which we have been granted an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by Amgen, to commercially develop, manufacture, use, distribute and sell therapeutic products containing compounds that bind to TREM2. In particular, we have been granted licenses under patents filed in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions that are owned or controlled by Amgen, including an exclusive license under certain patents claiming compounds that bind to TREM2. Our exclusively licensed patents include, but are not limited to, patents claiming the composition of TREM2 agonist compounds and methods of using the same.

Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, we must use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, gain marketing authorization and commercialize at least one mAb product and at least one small molecule product in each of several major market territories. In addition, Amgen provided us, at its expense, consulting support in connection with the transfer of the licensed materials and the exploitation of the products. We are also entitled to sublicense the rights granted to us under the license agreement.
As initial consideration for the license, we paid an upfront payment of $500,000 and also issued 6,928,566 shares of our Series A preferred stock to Amgen at the time of the initial closing with a subsequent 1,963,093 shares of our Series A preferred stock issued at the time of the milestone closing. As additional consideration for the license, we are required to pay Amgen up to $80.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones for the first mAb product and the first small molecule TREM2 agonist product and aggregate milestone payments of up to $350.0 million upon the achievement of specific commercial milestones across all such mAb products and small molecule products. No regulatory or commercial milestones have been achieved to date under the license agreement. We are also required to pay tiered royalties of low to mid single-digit percentages on annual net sales of the products covered by the license. In the event that the exploitation of a Product is not covered by a valid claim within the licensed patent rights, then the royalty rate with respect to the net sales shall be subject to a customary reduction by a certain percentage. The royalty term will terminate on a country-by-country basis on the later of (i) the expiration date of the last valid claim within the licensed patent rights, and (ii) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
The license agreement expires upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term for the products in the territory. Upon expiration of the license agreement, the licenses granted to us will be considered fully paid-up, irrevocable and non-exclusive. Either we or Amgen may terminate the license agreement if the other party commits a material breach of the agreement or defaults in the performance thereunder and fails to cure that breach within 90 days after written notice is provided or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up. Amgen has the right to terminate the license agreement in full upon written notice to us in the event we, our affiliates or sublicensees, directly challenge the patentability, enforceability or validity of any licensed patents, unless, in the event of a sublicensee challenge, we terminate the sublicense within 60 days’ notice. Amgen has the right to terminate the license agreement in the event we do not elect to treat a distracting product (as defined in the license agreement) as a newly added product under the license agreement. We shall have the right to terminate the license agreement if we conclude, due to scientific, technical, regulatory or commercial reasons, that the exploitation of the products is no longer commercially practicable.
In connection with the license agreement, Amgen entered into certain stockholder agreements related to this investment. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”
Master Services Agreement with FUJIFILM
In February 2021, we entered into a master services agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies UK Limited, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies Texas, LLC, FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc, and FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies Denmark ApS, or collectively, FUJIFILM, pursuant to which FUJIFILM provides research, development, testing and manufacturing services of certain of our product candidates, which are or will be designated as programs pursuant to scope of work agreements. The fees for such services are set out in each scope of work agreement. We may pay additional fees in consideration for certain research and development and technical consultancy services in relation to the procurement, testing and management of consumables; subcontracted work (including delivery of material to and from such subcontractors); process-specific equipment (including installation and qualification thereof); modifications; and special waste.
Either party may terminate the FUJIFILM Agreement by giving three months written notice to the other party, provided there are no uncompleted programs existing at the date such notice is given, or upon material breach that the breaching party cannot cure, does not cure within sixty (60) days if a breach for payment, or otherwise does not commence and diligently pursue a remedy within 60 days. Each scope of work will continue until the earlier of (i) the date the specified in the scope of work, or if no such date is specified, the date the program, or part of the program referred to in the scope of work, is completed, or (ii) termination of the master services agreement or the relevant scope of work. Additionally, upon providing written notice, we may cancel certain stages or programs for convenience, and FUJIFILM may terminate for certain unforeseen technical errors. We may also be required to pay FUJIFILM cancellation fees in the event that we decide to terminate the FUJIFILM Agreement pursuant to its terms, calculated as a percentage of the fees payable under the applicable scope of work agreement.

Intellectual Property
We actively seek to protect our proprietary technology, inventions, and other intellectual property that is commercially important to the development of our business by a variety of means, for example seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology for our product candidates and on continuing technological innovation, and we may rely on in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the strength of our position in the field of microglia-based therapeutics and TREM2 agonists that may be important for the development of our business. Our commercial success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain, maintain, enforce and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights for the technology, inventions and improvements and to defend any patents we may own or in-license in the future, prevent others from infringing any patents we may own or in-license in the future, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
Patent Protection
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, may not result in the issuance of patents and any issued patents we may obtain do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology or commercialize our product candidates. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in any patents we may own or in-license in the future. Any issued patents that we may own or in-license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or have the scope of their claims narrowed. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting the protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
The term of individual patents depends upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier expiring patent. The term of a U.S. patent claiming a new drug product may also be eligible for a limited patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. The term extension period granted on a U.S. patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of a clinical investigation involving human beings is begun and the submission date of an application, plus the time between the submission date of an application and the ultimate approval date. The term extension period cannot be longer than five years, and the term extension period may not extend the patent term beyond 14 years from the date of FDA approval. The United States Patent and Trademark Office reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA. In the future, if our product candidates receive approval by the FDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on any issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical studies for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties, will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustments to the terms of any patents we may own or in-license in the future. In addition, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Patent term may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our products for an adequate amount of time.
 Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business. We actively seek patent protection in the United States and foreign countries, as appropriate, for a variety of technologies, including active ingredients, such as VGL101 and small molecule TREM2 agonists, pharmaceutical compositions, and methods of use, such as for treating neurodegenerative diseases, and methods of selecting patient populations based on biomarkers. Our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets outside of the US is based on many factors, such as our available resources, the size of the commercial market, the availability of patent protection under the local patent laws and the ability to effectively enforce patents upon grant under the local patent laws.


Our product candidates are primarily protected by composition of matter and method of use patents and patent applications. As of February 28, 2023, our patent estate protecting VGL101 and our small molecule TREM2 agonists is summarized as follows.
VGL101
We have an exclusive license from Amgen to one patent family directed to VGL101 and other TREM2 antibodies and corresponding compositions and methods of use. This patent family was filed in major markets including the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, China and over 30 additional countries. Applications in this patent family have issued in certain countries including the U.S. (U.S. 11,186,636). Patents issuing in this family have a standard 20-year term that expire in 2038; in each instance provided that all appropriate maintenance fees are paid and not including any patent term adjustment, patent term extension, or Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) that may be available on a country-by-country basis.
In addition, we solely own various patent families that are directed to potentially commercially relevant methods of use that involve VGL101. When timely, the relevant patent families have been filed in major markets, including the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and oftentimes were filed more extensively in additional countries. Patents issuing in these families have a standard 20-year term that expire between 2041 and 2042; in each instance provided that all appropriate maintenance fees are paid and not including any patent term adjustment, patent term extension, or Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) that may be available on a country-by-country basis.
Small Molecule TREM2 Agonists
We jointly own with Amgen, and have exclusive rights to, two patent families that are directed to small molecule TREM2 agonist compounds, and corresponding compositions and methods of use. These patent families were filed in major markets including the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, China and over 30 additional countries. Patents issuing in this family have a standard 20-year term that expire in 2041; in each instance provided that all appropriate maintenance fees are paid and not including any patent term adjustment, patent term extension, or Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) that may be available on a country-by-country basis.
In addition, we solely own a variety of patent families that are directed to small molecule TREM2 agonist compounds, and corresponding compositions and methods of use. Patents issuing in these families have a standard 20-year term that expire in 2042; in each instance provided that all appropriate maintenance fees are paid and not including any patent term adjustment, patent term extension, or Supplementary Protection Certificate (SPC) that may be available on a country-by-country basis.
Trade Secrets
We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment or term of service. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Commercialization
We do not currently have any approved drugs, and we do not expect to have any approved drugs in the near term. As a company, we do not have sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities. We will evaluate all available options for commercialization of our potential therapies, if approved for commercialization by FDA and other relevant regulatory worldwide bodies. We may consider building out our own commercialization infrastructure in the United States, Europe, Asia and other geographies, entering into co-commercialization agreements with other biopharmaceutical companies with strong and proven commercial capabilities, and licensing select or all geographical rights for some or all of our therapies.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our drug candidates and currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates for use in human clinical trials in compliance with FDA and other

foreign regulatory requirements, and on contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) to manufacture and supply our preclinical and clinical materials.
VGL101 is a monoclonal antibody produced from a recombinant cell line. We have established non-exclusive relationships with CDMOs for the GMP manufacturing of VGL101 drug substance and drug product, and with other third parties for testing, fill finish, packaging and labeling. We have a license from Amgen Inc. for use of its proprietary cell lines and media, which we rely on for manufacturing VGL101. FUJIFILM is currently, and will be for the foreseeable future, the sole supplier of certain testing and manufacturing services for VGL101.
The small molecule compound we are developing is produced through chemical synthesis technology. Our selection of a development candidate, along with potential back up compounds, will be made not only on the basis of potential clinical activity and tolerability, but also on the relative ease and reproducibility of synthesis, reasonable cost of goods and ready availability of starting materials. We plan to retain a contract manufacturing organization to produce our small molecule agonist for use in our clinical trials.
We do not have long-term supply agreements, and we purchase our required drug product on a development manufacturing services agreement or purchase order basis. We expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. We have personnel with significant technical, manufacturing, analytical, quality, regulatory, including cGMP, and project management experience to oversee our third-party manufacturers and to manage manufacturing and quality data and information for regulatory compliance purposes.
Our product candidates for clinical trial use must be manufactured in compliance with cGMP regulations. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, pricing, reimbursement, sales, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, post-approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of drugs and biological products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining marketing approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory authorities, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Licensure and Regulation of Drugs and Biologics in the United States
In the United States, where we are initially focusing our product development, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. We are currently developing product candidates that would be regulated under the FDCA, and/or the PHSA, and their implementing regulations, as drugs or biologics, depending on the modality of each product candidate. Our product candidates are early-stage and have not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug or biologic in the United States generally must satisfactorily complete each of the following steps:
•preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations, as applicable; 
 •completion of the manufacture, under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) conditions, of the drug substance and drug product that the sponsor intends to use in human clinical trials along with required analytical and stability testing; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 


•approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB), representing each clinical trial site before each clinical trial site may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (GCP) and any additional nonclinical studies required to establish the safety, efficacy, potency and purity of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
 •preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application (NDA), or a Biologics License Application (BLA), for a biologic product, requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications, including submission of detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labeling; 
 •review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of any FDA audits of the preclinical studies and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GLP, as applicable, and GCP, and the integrity of clinical data in support of the NDA or BLA; 
 •payment of user fees under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), unless exempted; 
 •securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and 
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) and any post-approval studies or other post-marketing commitments required by the FDA. 
 The failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, including preclinical testing, clinical testing, the approval process, or post-approval process, may subject an applicant to delays in the conduct of the study, regulatory review and approval and/or administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions may include, but are not limited to, the FDA’s refusal to allow an applicant to proceed with clinical testing, refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, issuance of warning or untitled letters, adverse publicity, product recalls, marketing restrictions, product seizures, import detentions and refusals, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines and civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA or the Department of Justice (DOJ), and other governmental entities, including state agencies.
Preclinical Studies and Investigational New Drug Application
Before testing any therapeutic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate the potential for efficacy and toxicity in animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, and plans for the proposed clinical studies, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue after an IND is submitted.
An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in a clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about the product or conduct of the proposed clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In that case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before the clinical trials can begin.
As a result, submission of the IND may result in the FDA not allowing the trials to commence or allowing the trial to commence on the terms originally specified by the sponsor in the IND. If the FDA raises concerns or questions either during this initial 30-day period, or at any time during the IND review process, it may choose to impose a partial or complete clinical hold. Clinical holds may be imposed by the FDA when there is concern for patient safety, and may be a result of new data, findings, or developments in clinical, preclinical and/or chemistry, manufacturing and controls or where there is non-compliance with regulatory requirements. This order issued by the FDA would delay either a proposed clinical trial or cause suspension of an ongoing trial, until all outstanding concerns have been adequately addressed and the FDA has notified the company that investigations may proceed. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive

clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin.
Human Clinical Trials in Support of an NDA or BLA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients with the disease or condition to be treated under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, inclusion and exclusion criteria, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive GCP rules and the requirements for informed consent.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary. The GCP requirements encompass both ethical and data integrity standards for clinical trials. The FDA’s regulations are intended to help ensure the protection of human subjects enrolled in non-IND foreign clinical trials, as well as the quality and integrity of the resulting data. They further help ensure that non-IND foreign trials are conducted in a manner comparable to that required for clinical trials in the United States.
Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB either centrally or individually at each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, clinical trial design, patient informed consent, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. The FDA, IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with GCP requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board (DSMB), or data monitoring committee (DMC). This group may recommend continuation of the trial as planned, changes in trial conduct, or cessation of the trial at designated check points based on certain available data from the trial to which only the DSMB/DMC has access.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Additional studies may be required after approval.
•Phase 1 clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of healthy subjects or disease-affected patients to test the product candidate for safety, including adverse effects, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics. 
 •Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted indications and determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more costly Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3 clinical trials typically proceed if the Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase 3 clinical trials are generally undertaken within an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. A well-controlled, statistically robust Phase 3 trial may be designed to deliver the data that regulatory authorities will use to decide whether or not to approve, and, if approved, how to appropriately label a therapeutic. 
 In some cases, the FDA may approve an NDA or BLA for a product but require the sponsor to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the product’s safety and effectiveness after approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and to document a clinical benefit for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. The failure to exercise due diligence with regard to conducting Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.

Information about applicable clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA, BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDCA requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The sponsor and the FDA must reach agreement on the PSP. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Compliance with cGMP Requirements
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products like biologics whose attributes cannot be precisely defined.
Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of products must also register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Any product manufactured by or imported from a facility that has not registered, whether foreign or domestic, is deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Establishments may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other laws. Noncompliance with such requirements can lead to adverse findings by the FDA during these inspections; in instances of significant or continued noncompliance, such adverse findings can serve as the basis for additional regulatory action by the FDA, including but not limited to warning and “untitled” letters.
Review and Approval of an NDA or BLA
The results of product candidate development, preclinical testing and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The NDA or BLA must contain extensive manufacturing information and detailed information on the composition of the product and proposed labeling as well as payment of a user fee. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs are subject to an application user fee. The sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for products with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses.

The FDA has 60 days after submission of the application to conduct an initial review to determine whether to accept it for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the application. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority review of the application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs and BLAs. The review process may be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and any FDA audits of preclinical and clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If the application is not approved, the FDA will issue a complete response letter, which will contain the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application, and when possible, will outline recommended actions the sponsor might take to obtain approval of the application. The complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter have one year to submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the deficiencies identified by the FDA. The FDA will then re-review the application, taking into consideration the response, and determine whether the application meets the criteria for approval. Failure to respond to a complete response letter will serve as a withdrawal of an application. The FDA will not approve an application until issues identified in any complete response letters have been addressed.
The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee.
Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
If the FDA approves a new product, it may limit the approved indication(s) for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to further assess the product’s efficacy and/or safety after approval. The agency may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including a REMS program, to help ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patent registries. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations
FDA provides programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new products that are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. These designations are not mutually exclusive, and a product candidate may qualify for one or more of these programs. While these programs are intended to expedite product development and approval, they do not alter the standards for FDA approval.
The FDA may designate a product for fast track designation if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For products with fast track designation, sponsors may have

more frequent interactions with the FDA, the product is potentially eligible for accelerated approval and priority review, if relevant criteria are met, and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a product with fast track designation’s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a product with fast track designation may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff managers in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. Breakthrough designation may be rescinded if a product no longer meets the qualifying criteria.
The FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a product that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting adverse reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. Priority review designation may be rescinded if a product no longer meets the qualifying criteria.
Accelerated Approval Pathway
The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a product. Products granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is permitted to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval confirmatory study or studies be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Sponsors are also required to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. Under FDORA, the FDA is empowered to take action, such as issuing fines, against companies that fail to conduct with due diligence any post-approval confirmatory study or submit timely reports to the agency on their progress. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies or dissemination of false or misleading promotional materials would allow the FDA to withdraw the product from the market on an expedited basis. In addition, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Orphan Drug Designation
Orphan drug designation in the United States is designed to encourage sponsors to develop products intended for treatment of rare diseases or conditions. In the United States, a rare disease or condition is statutorily defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
Orphan drug designation qualifies a company for tax credits and market exclusivity for seven years following the date of the product’s marketing approval if granted by the FDA. An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. After FDA grants orphan designation, the product must then go through the review and approval process like any other product.
A sponsor may request orphan drug designation of a previously unapproved product or new orphan indication for an already marketed product. In addition, a sponsor of a product that is otherwise the same product as an already approved orphan drug may seek and obtain orphan drug designation for the subsequent product for the same rare disease or condition if it can present a plausible hypothesis that its product may be clinically superior to the first drug. More than one sponsor may receive orphan drug designation for the same product for the same rare disease or condition, but each sponsor seeking orphan drug designation must file a complete request for designation.
If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. If a product designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
The period of exclusivity begins on the date that the marketing application is approved by the FDA and applies only to the indication for which the product has been designated. The FDA may approve a second application for the same product for a different use or a second application for a clinically superior version of the product for the same use. The FDA cannot, however, approve the same product made by another manufacturer for the same indication during the market exclusivity period unless it has the consent of the sponsor, or the sponsor is unable to provide sufficient quantities.
Pediatric Exclusivity
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity that cover the product are extended by six months.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Extension and Marketing Exclusivity
In the United States, a patent claiming a new drug or biologic product, its method of use or its method of manufacture may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent extension of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review. Assuming grant of the patent for which the extension is sought, the restoration period for a patent covering a product is typically one-half the time between the effective date of the IND and the submission date of the NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of the NDA or BLA and the ultimate approval date, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date in the United States. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent for which extension is sought. A patent that covers multiple products for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension in consultation with the FDA.
Marketing exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to

gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the ACA, which was signed into law in March 2010, included a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA). The BPCIA established a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. A biosimilar is a biological product that is highly similar to an existing FDA-licensed “reference product.” The FDA has issued multiple guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is “biosimilar to” or “interchangeable with” a previously approved biological product or “reference product.” In order for the FDA to approve a biosimilar product, it must find that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference product and proposed biosimilar product in terms of safety, purity and potency. For the FDA to approve a biosimilar product as interchangeable with a reference product, the agency must find that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product, and (for products administered multiple times) that the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date of approval of the reference product. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Since the passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, including laws governing pharmacy practices, which are state regulated, to regulate the use of biosimilars.
Post-Approval Regulation
If regulatory approval for a product or new indication for an existing product is obtained, the sponsor will be required to comply with all post-approval regulatory requirements as well as any specific post-approval requirements that the FDA has imposed as part of the approval process. The sponsor will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling, record-keeping, and product tracking and tracing requirements. Manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon manufacturers. Accordingly, the sponsor and its third-party manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements.
A biological product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official lot release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety, purity, potency and effectiveness of pharmaceutical products.

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; 
 •complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product recall, seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drug products placed on the market. This regulation includes, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. Promotional claims about a drug’s safety or effectiveness are prohibited before the drug is approved. After approval, a drug product generally may not be promoted for uses or patient populations that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the product’s prescribing information (known as “off-label” use). In the United States, healthcare professionals are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for such off-label uses because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose rigorous restrictions on manufacturers’ communications, prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use.
If a company, including any agent of the company or anyone speaking on behalf of the company, is found to have promoted off-label uses, the company may become subject to adverse public relations and administrative and judicial enforcement by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as state authorities. This could subject a company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.
Federal and State Data Privacy and Security Laws
Under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has issued regulations to protect the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI), used or disclosed by covered entities including certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA also regulates standardization of data content, codes and formats used in healthcare transactions and standardization of identifiers for health plans and providers. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 or HITECH, and their regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, also imposes certain obligations on the business associates of covered entities that obtain protected health information in providing services to or on behalf of covered entities. In addition to federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws governing confidentiality and security of health information that are applicable to our business. In addition to possible federal administrative, civil and criminal penalties for HIPAA violations, state attorneys general are authorized to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. Accordingly, state attorneys general have brought civil actions seeking injunctions and damages resulting from alleged violations of HIPAA’s privacy and security rules. New laws and regulations governing privacy and security may be adopted in the future as well.

Additionally, states, such as California, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia and Colorado have recently enacted the consumer privacy laws that grant rights to data subjects and place increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. While we are not currently subject to laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), some observers note that the CCPA and similar legislation could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions under such laws, it is possible that some of our current or future business activities, including certain clinical research, sales and marketing practices and the provision of certain items and services to our customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such privacy and data security laws. The heightening compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and secure systems to comply with different privacy compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions could increase the possibility that we may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any applicable privacy or data security laws or regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a consent decree or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that we collect or otherwise process personal information, we may be subject to privacy or data protection laws that are in effect in such third countries foreign laws.
Regulation and Procedures Governing Approval of Medicinal Products Outside the United States
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, an applicant will need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. For example, the process governing approval of medicinal products in the European Union generally follows the same lines as in the United States. It entails satisfactory completion of preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication. It also requires the submission to the relevant competent authorities of a marketing authorization application (MAA) and granting of a marketing authorization by these authorities before the product can be marketed and sold in the European Union.
Clinical Trial Approval
In April 2014, the European Union adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (CTR), which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive. The CTR entered into application on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the CTR offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Clinical Trials Directive and the CTR if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the CTR became applicable. If the sponsor chooses to submit under the Clinical Trials Directive, the clinical trial continues to be governed by the Clinical Trial Directive until three years after the CTR became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after the CTR became applicable, the CTR will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial. The CTR overhauls the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation, which is directly applicable in all European Union Member States (meaning no national implementing legislation in each Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the European Union, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. For instance, the CTR provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The application procedure is divided into two parts; Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation. Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. Parties conducting certain clinical trials must, as in the United States, post clinical trial information in the European Union at the EudraCT website: https://eudract.ema.europa.eu.

PRIME Designation in the European Union
In March 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) launched an initiative to facilitate development of therapeutic candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines (PRIME), scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of therapeutic candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated marketing authorization application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP), or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
Marketing Authorization
To obtain a marketing authorization for a product under the European Union regulatory system, an applicant must submit an MAA, either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in European Union Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure, or mutual recognition procedure). A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the European Union. Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved pediatric investigation plan (PIP), covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA (PDCO), may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine for children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine for children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the so-called Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate extension. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union Member States, as well as the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) (EEA). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer, HIV, AIDS, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the European Union, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union.
Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP established at the EMA is responsible for conducting an initial assessment of a product. The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major public health interest particularly from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops), but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

National marketing authorizations, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the European Union, this national authorization can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national authorization in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure.
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the European Union make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the European Union, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting a marketing authorization in the United Kingdom or Great Britain.
 Data and market exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, new chemical entities (including both small molecules and biological medicinal products) approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as amended, and Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. Data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no medicinal product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be a new chemical entity so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Patent Term Extensions in the European Union and Other Jurisdictions
The European Union also provides for patent term extension through SPCs. The rules and requirements for obtaining a SPC are similar to those in the United States. An SPC may extend the term of a patent for up to five years after its originally scheduled expiration date and can provide up to a maximum of fifteen years of marketing exclusivity for a drug. In certain circumstances, these periods may be extended for six additional months if pediatric exclusivity is obtained; and in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. Although SPCs are available throughout the European Union, sponsors must apply on a country-by-country basis. Similar patent term extension rights exist in certain other foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union.
Periods of Authorization and Renewals
A marketing authorization is valid for five years, in principle, and it may be renewed indefinitely after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA (for a centrally authorized product), or by the competent authority of the authorizing Member State (for a nationally authorized product). Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization that is not followed by the

placement of the drug on the European Union market (in the case of the centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing Member State (in the case of a national procedure) within three years after authorization, or which is not placed on the market for a consecutive period of three years at any time during its authorization, ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
Regulatory Requirements After Marketing Authorization
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product, and must adhere in strict compliance with the applicable European Union laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These include compliance with the European Union’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, pursuant to which post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations can be imposed. In addition, the manufacturing of authorized products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the EMA’s GMP requirements and comparable requirements of other regulatory bodies in the European Union, which mandate the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packing of drugs to assure their safety and identity.
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statue prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is sometimes governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union member states and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the European Union.
Payments made to physicians in certain European Union member states must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the European Union. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under European Union directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition, (2) either (i) such condition affects no more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (ii) without the benefits derived from orphan status, it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the European Union would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development; (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the European Union or, if such method exists, the product would be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
An orphan designation provides a number of benefits, including fee reductions, regulatory assistance and the possibility to apply for a centralized European Union marketing authorization. Marketing authorization for an orphan medicinal product leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity being granted following marketing approval of the orphan product. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA, the European Commission or the Member States may only grant marketing authorization

to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation because, for example, the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the UK voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”), and the UK formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020. There was a transition period during which European Union pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the UK, which ended on December 31, 2020. However, the European Union and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and European Union pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented European Union legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the European Union regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore currently broadly aligns with European Union regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the European Union and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and European Union pharmaceutical legislation.
In addition, once we begin to conduct business in the United Kingdom, we will be subject to stringent data protection laws that are in effect in the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the European Union’s GDPR, the European Commission has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing.
 General Data Protection Regulation
Once we begin processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EEA, including personal health data, our activities will be subject to the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenues, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Compliance with the GDPR will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices to ensure full compliance.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels.
There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
•a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 •safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 •appropriate for the specific patient; 
 •cost-effective; and 
 •neither experimental nor investigational. 
 There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly-approved products. Increasing efforts by governmental and other third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
 Further, net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price, or ASP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.

Healthcare Reform
Payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs and those methods are not always specifically adapted for new technologies such as gene therapy and therapies addressing rare diseases such as those we are developing. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administrations or other efforts, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA, will impact our business.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. Further, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction began April 1, 2022, lasting through June 30, 2022. The 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022.
 Other legislative and regulatory changes have also been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted:
•On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the temporary suspension, a 1% payment reduction occurred beginning April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022, and the 2% payment reduction resumed on July 1, 2022.
 •On January 2, 2013, the U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers.
 •On April 13, 2017, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, published a final rule that gives states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces, which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the ACA for plans sold through such marketplaces.


•On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 •On May 23, 2019, CMS published a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. 
 •On December 20, 2019, former President Trump signed into law the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1865), which repealed the Cadillac tax, the health insurance provider tax, and the medical device excise tax. It is impossible to determine whether similar taxes could be instated in the future. 
 •In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that create a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D pricing for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. The effect of IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 •There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. 
 •At the federal level, President Biden signed an Executive Order on July 9, 2021 affirming the administration’s policy to (i) support legislative reforms that would lower the prices of prescription drug and biologics, including by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, by imposing inflation caps, and, by supporting the development and market entry of lower-cost generic drugs and biosimilars; and (ii) support the enactment of a public health insurance option. Among other things, the Executive Order also directs HHS to provide a report on actions to combat excessive pricing of prescription drugs, enhance the domestic drug supply chain, reduce the price that the Federal government pays for drugs, and address price gouging in the industry; and directs the FDA to work with states and Indian Tribes that propose to develop section 804 Importation Programs in accordance with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, and the FDA’s implementing regulations. FDA released such implementing regulations on September 24, 2020, which went into effect on November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. On September 25, 2020, CMS stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under Section 1927 of the Social Security Act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or Average Manufacturer Price purposes. Since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs, CMS further stated it will not publish a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for these drugs. If implemented, importation of drugs from Canada may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our product candidates.
 •On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an Interim Final Rule implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model under which Medicare Part B reimbursement rates would have been calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. However, on December 29, 2021 CMS rescinded the Most Favored Nations rule.
 •Additionally, on December 2, 2020, HHS published a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. Pursuant to court order, the removal and addition of the aforementioned safe harbors were delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. The IRA further delayed implementation of this rule to January 1, 2032.


•There has also been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 •We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, lower reimbursement, and new payment methodologies. This could lower the price that we receive for our products. Any denial in coverage or reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar denial or reduction in payments from private payors, which may prevent us from being able to generate sufficient revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products. It is not clear how other future potential changes to the ACA will change the reimbursement model and market outlook for our current and future therapeutic candidates.
 Other Healthcare Laws
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease, order, arrangement, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties; 
 •the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement of record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery; 
 •HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and 


willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that perform services for them that involve the creation, maintenance, receipt, use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; 
 •The U.S. federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified-nurse midwives); 
 •federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and 
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm customers. 
 Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective May 2018 also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. These characteristics also apply to the development and commercialization of treatments in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD. While we believe that our focus, expertise, scientific knowledge and intellectual property provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from several different sources, including large and small biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research organizations, that conduct research, seek and obtain patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements, sometimes exclusive, for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.

Competition can arise from third parties which are pursuing therapeutics that target the same molecular targets as our product candidates, therapeutics that are being developed for the same diseases or disorders as our product candidates, or both, therapeutics that target the same molecular targets and are being developed for the same diseases or disorders as our product candidates. In general, we consider our closest competitors as third parties that are conducting clinical trials to evaluate such therapeutics.
We further define and evaluate competition based on the nature of the disease or disorder that is potentially addressed by our product candidates. For instance, we consider competition more broadly in the context of rare diseases and more narrowly for diseases or disorders that are common. That is, we are more apt to consider a third party a competitor if it is clinically developing a therapeutic for the same rare disease in which we are developing our product candidates, irrespective of the molecular target of the third party therapeutic. On the other hand, we are less inclined to consider a third party a competitor in the case of a common disease, unless the third party is clinically developing a therapeutic that targets the same molecular target as our product candidates. Nevertheless, the competitive landscape, particularly for common diseases, is highly complex and can be influenced by the success or failure of third party therapeutics that are being developed for the same disease or disorder as our product candidates. As a result, our share price may be positively or negatively influenced by the activities of such third parties irrespective of whether we consider them to be a competitor or not.
We are aware of third parties which are pursuing therapeutics that target the same molecular targets as our product candidates. Because our current product candidates target TREM2, we consider the following third parties to be our closest competitors: Alector, Inc. (“Alector”) which is developing AL002, a TREM2 targeting antibody, for Alzheimer’s disease in collaboration with AbbVie, Inc.; and Denali Therapeutics, Inc. (“Denali”), which is developing DNL919/TAK-920, a TREM2 targeting antibody, for Alzheimer’s disease in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.
Regarding therapeutics that are being developed for the same diseases or disorders as our product candidates, we consider the main competitors as follows:
 •VGL101 for ALSP: we are not aware of any third parties that are clinically developing therapeutics for ALSP. Further, no products have been approved to treat ALSP. Academics have investigated the use of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a small number of ALSP patients, however, we believe this procedure has limited benefits and several key limitations. 
 •Small molecule TREM2 agonists for AD: we are not aware of any third parties clinically developing small molecules that target TREM2 for AD. There are, however, many third parties pursuing clinical development of therapeutics for AD. As mentioned, Alector and Denali are each clinically developing TREM2 targeting antibody therapeutics. The University of Oxford in collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV has reported a Phase I trial of JNJ-40346527 (edicotinib), a small molecule CSF-1R antagonist. Elixiron Immunotherapeutics, Inc. has reported a Phase I trial of EI-1071, a small molecule that inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of CSF-1R. In addition, there are others developing therapeutics for AD that do not target TREM2. Notable examples include those that are based on reduction of ß-amyloid plaques, such as ADUHELM® (aducanumab-avwa) and LEQEMBI (lecanemab-irmb), both of which are from Biogen, Inc. and were FDA approved in 2021 and 2023, respectively. Other ß-amyloid therapeutics and additional approaches for AD are being pursued by Roche (Genentech), Eli Lilly and others.
 Many of our competitors have significant financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting qualified scientific and management personnel as well as establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in acquiring new technologies. If we successfully obtain approval for any therapeutic candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the safety and effectiveness of our therapeutics, the ease with which our therapeutics can be administered, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage and patent position. Competing products could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, more convenient, less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products or technological approaches may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing our therapeutic candidates. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of the therapeutics we may develop could be adversely affected.
Human Capital Resources
As of February 28, 2023, we had 56 full-time employees and 19 of our employees have M.D. or Ph.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 36 employees are engaged in research and development and 20 are engaged in business development, finance,

legal, and general management and administration. Our human capital resources objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
