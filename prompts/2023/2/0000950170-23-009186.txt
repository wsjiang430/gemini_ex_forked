Item 1. Business
 We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing minimally invasive solutions to meet the distinct uterine healthcare needs of women. We have established a broad product line of commercially available, minimally invasive alternatives to hysterectomy, which are designed to address the most common causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in most uterine anatomies. Our solutions can be used in a variety of medical treatment settings and aim to address the drawbacks associated with alternative treatment methods and to preserve the uterus by avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies.
There is a significant body of peer reviewed literature that we believe validates the clinical performance of our solutions and supports the ability of our products to meaningfully improve the quality of life for women suffering from AUB. The short- and long-term safety and effectiveness of our endometrial ablation systems, which have obtained approval through the premarket approval application (PMA) process, have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials that had sites audited by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) estimates that one-third of women will seek treatment for AUB. This represents nearly 18 million women of the approximately 55 million women in the 25 to 50 age group in the United States. In addition to the existing patient population with AUB, we estimate that approximately 750,000 women in the United States suffering from AUB enter the 25 to 50 age group each year, representing a potential annual recurring market opportunity of over $900 million. We are well positioned to serve this patient population and we believe that our solutions have the potential to further change the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for AUB.
AUB is caused by a variety of factors and is characterized by menstrual blood loss in excess of 80 milliliters (ml) per menstrual cycle, which is two to three times the average blood loss during a normal menstrual cycle. These factors include structural causes within the uterus, such as fibroids and polyps, and non-structural causes, such as hormonal imbalances. AUB can have a significant impact on a woman’s quality of life. Women suffering from AUB typically need to change their sanitary products every two hours or less and pass blood clots the size of a quarter or larger. When left untreated, AUB can stop women from engaging in ordinary daily activities during menstruation, which interferes with their family, social, personal, and professional lives. Prolonged bleeding can result in fatigue and, in extreme cases, anemia.
Treatment for AUB is dependent on a number of factors, including the underlying cause of AUB, the patient’s desire for future fertility, and the anatomy of the uterine cavity. The current treatment pathway for patients suffering from AUB typically begins with medical management or drug therapy, to help manage symptoms. When drug therapies are not effective or side effects are intolerable, patients may progress to surgical management, such as endometrial ablation for non-structural causes, or tissue resection for structural causes. If endometrial ablation or tissue resection fail or are contraindicated, physicians may recommend a hysterectomy. While tissue resection preserves fertility, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are only an option for patients for whom childbearing is complete.
Our devices are designed to provide minimally invasive and clinically validated options for women suffering from AUB and significantly improve a woman’s quality of life, while avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. Our acquisition of a suite of intrauterine health assets from Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) in May 2020 enables us to offer a broad suite of products for procedures that address structural and non-structural causes of AUB in most uterine anatomies. Our devices are utilized by obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs) across a variety of medical treatment settings, including hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), and physician offices.
Our broad suite of solutions is comprised of the following:
•Minerva ES Endometrial Ablation System (Minerva ES) is a PMA-approved endometrial ablation device that utilizes our proprietary PlasmaSense technology, which is designed to dynamically direct plasma energy with real-time power modulation and to enable complete and uniform depth of ablation. This device showed clinical performance that exceeded an Objective Performance Criteria (OPC) developed by the FDA using clinical trial efficacy data from five previously FDA-approved endometrial ablation systems; 
 •Genesys HTA Endometrial Ablation System (Genesys HTA) is a PMA-approved endometrial ablation device, complementary to our Minerva ES, that is designed to deliver heated saline ablation under continuous, real-time, direct hysteroscopic visualization, and to enable treatment of a wider range of uterine cavities, including those with irregular sizes or shapes; 
 •Symphion Tissue Removal System (Symphion) is a minimally invasive uterine tissue removal system, components of which were authorized through the 510(k) clearance or received de novo classification from the FDA, that combines bladeless tissue resection and coagulation, continuous visualization, and intrauterine pressure monitoring. These features enable efficient tissue removal while reducing patient risk due to fluid intravasation overload by utilizing a self-contained, recirculating distension fluid management system; and 


•Resectr Tissue Resection Device (Resectr) is an FDA-cleared handheld surgical instrument designed to enable the hysteroscopic removal and diagnosis of endometrial polyps, utilizing an oscillating cutting blade, and be compatible with existing fluid management systems, wall suction and hysteroscopes. 
 
We believe our solutions can provide the following important benefits:
•Improved quality of life. Our solutions are designed to eliminate the pain and life disruption of unwanted, excessive menstrual bleeding;
 •Enhanced patient safety. Our proprietary safety enhancements are designed to reduce the potential complications associated with other endometrial ablation and tissue resection alternatives;
 •Favorable clinical outcomes. The clinical performance of our PMA-approved products has been evaluated in numerous clinical research studies, demonstrating high rates of procedural success driven by our continued technological innovation; 
 •Intuitive design and procedural ergonomics. Our products are designed to offer easy setup and intuitive operation, which we believe enables a rapid learning curve and fast adoption by physicians; and 
 •Increased patient comfort and convenience. Our minimally invasive solutions are engineered to maximize the patient’s experience by reducing procedure and recovery times. 
 The safety and effectiveness of our Minerva endometrial ablation system were evaluated in two clinical studies, the Minerva Single-Arm Study (Single-Arm Study) and the Minerva Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), which collectively evaluated 263 patients enrolled at clinical centers in the United States, Canada, Hungary, and Mexico. The results from these two studies served as the basis for FDA approval of our PMA in July 2015 and the results of the Single-Arm Study and RCT were published in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. The safety, effectiveness, and clinical benefits of the Genesys HTA were evaluated in a pivotal clinical trial, which included 276 patients enrolled in clinical centers in the United States. The results from this trial served as the basis for the FDA approval of this PMA in April 2001, with Genesys HTA having met all of its primary and secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints. Our Genesys HTA system has subsequently been evaluated in a large number of clinical research studies. The published results and decades of physician use have been consistent with, and we believe have supported, the validity of the data derived from the original PMA clinical study.
We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States. Our target customer base includes approximately 19,000 OB/GYNs practicing in hospitals, ASCs, and physician offices. As of December 31, 2022, our commercial team consisted of approximately 89 field-based personnel that call on OB/GYNs in all major U.S. markets. Our sales and marketing programs focus on educating physicians regarding the use of our products and on providing materials to help them educate their patients about our procedures. We also provide online patient-oriented educational materials about AUB and our products and procedures, which patients may use to consider and then discuss treatment options with their physicians.
Third-party coverage and reimbursement for endometrial ablation and tissue resection procedures performed in a hospital, ASCs, or physician office setting are well established in the United States. These procedures are routinely covered and reimbursed by private healthcare insurance, managed care payors, and government healthcare programs. In the United States, the procedures using our products are billed by these healthcare facilities and providers using established Category I Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes.
Our research and development team evaluates new product opportunities, product enhancements, and alternative applications of our proprietary technology. For example, our team is currently focused on evaluating options to expand our Symphion product line in order to provide a broader set of compatible solutions for our Symphion controller that will provide additional procedure solutions at a number of different price points. We intend to leverage our core technologies to develop and expand our product offerings through development of new products and technologies, subject to marketing clearance or approval, as well as improvement of our existing portfolio of products and acquisition of complementary products.
Our success factors
We are focused on treating AUB with device-enabled solutions that are minimally invasive and designed to improve a woman’s quality of life, while avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. We believe the continued growth of our company will be driven by the following success factors:
•Targeting a large and under-penetrated market opportunity. ACOG estimates that one-third of women will seek treatment for AUB. This represents nearly 18 million women of the approximately 55 million women in the 25 to 50 age group in the United States. In addition to the existing patient population with AUB, we estimate that approximately 750,000 women in the United States that will suffer from AUB enter the 25 to 50 age group each year, representing a potential annual recurring market opportunity of over $900 million. We are well-positioned to serve this patient population. 


•Broadening our suite of innovative and proprietary minimally invasive solutions focused on women’s intrauterine health. We have established a broad product line of commercially available, minimally invasive alternatives to hysterectomy, which are indicated for use in procedures that treat the most common causes of AUB in most uterine anatomies. Our products can be used in a variety of medical treatment settings and aim to address the major drawbacks associated with device-based alternatives, reduce risks of non-adherence to drug treatments, and preserve the uterus by avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. We believe our solutions represent a significant competitive advantage and have the potential to further change the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for AUB. 
 •Compelling body of clinical evidence. There is a significant body of peer-reviewed literature supporting the safety and effectiveness of endometrial ablation and hysteroscopic tissue resection as treatment modalities for AUB. Clinical performance of our products has been validated and the results have been published in approximately 100 peer-reviewed publications, including, among others, in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. We believe that the short- and long-term safety and effectiveness of our PMA approved products have been validated through multiple randomized controlled clinical trials that have had sites audited by the FDA. We believe our body of high-quality clinical evidence demonstrates the strong value proposition of our products and will continue to support increased adoption of our entire suite of solutions. 
 •Comprehensive and targeted approach to market development and patient engagement. We have established a systematic approach to market development that centers on active engagement with hospitals, physicians, and patients. Our target customer base includes approximately 19,000 OB/GYNs practicing in hospitals, ASCs, and physician offices. Our direct sales organization is focused on prioritizing high volume OB/GYN centers and in building long-standing relationships with key physicians. Our sales force works closely with physicians to incorporate our solution as a new service by reiterating the clinical efficacy and procedural benefits of our products. We support these physicians through all aspects of education, surgical support, and patient follow-up. We further build upon this approach with patient-oriented marketing materials and direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives to help educate patients on AUB and our procedures. We believe that our approach to engagement across multiple constituents will drive increased awareness of, and demand for, our products. In addition, we believe that our broad product portfolio is naturally supportive of our marketing efforts, as we seek to continue to extend our relationships with hospitals and physicians. 
 •Continued favorable insurance coverage and established inpatient and outpatient reimbursement. In the United States, the procedures using our products are routinely covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, including private healthcare insurance, managed care payors and government healthcare programs. Healthcare facilities, including hospitals and ASCs, and physicians use established Category I CPT codes to bill for the procedures using our products. We believe that current reimbursement in the United States is generally sufficient to cover the costs of the procedure and related patient care, including the costs of our products. 
 •Robust technical and engineering expertise, supported by our broad strategic intellectual property portfolio. We believe our products incorporate significant technological advancements in gynecologic surgery over the prior generation of endometrial ablation products. Development of our solutions requires a unique combination of expertise in engineering, product and software design, and women’s health. Our technical capabilities and commitment to innovation support a compelling opportunity to advance new technologies and enhance our products, which we believe will continue to differentiate our position. Our issued patents cover various differentiating technical advantages of our disposable devices, controllers, and methods of treatment. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 88 issued U.S. patents, 54 issued patents outside the U.S., and 19 pending U.S. and 8 pending foreign patent applications to cover key aspects of our devices and future product concepts. 
 •Proven management team with deep industry expertise. Our senior management team has over 250 years of combined experience in the medical technology and life science industries.

For example, we are currently evaluating options to expand our Symphion product line in order to provide a broader set of compatible solutions for our Symphion controller that will provide additional procedure solutions at a number of different price points. We believe our pipeline initiatives, if successfully developed and cleared or approved, will result in increased access to our products by physicians, who will be able to perform a broader range of procedures using our surgical products, thereby increasing the total number of procedures performed and growing our addressable market. 
 •Leveraging our clinical success to increase utilization and penetration among existing accounts and to expand into new international markets. We intend to leverage our clinical success to deepen and expand the relationships we have with our existing and newly acquired accounts. Our suite of minimally invasive devices has been designed to provide ease-of-use, which we believe offers a compelling value proposition for hospitals, physicians, and patients. While our current commercial focus is on the large opportunity within the United States, we plan to evaluate expanding into select international markets.
 Our market and industry
AUB is a prevalent and debilitating condition that significantly impacts the quality of life of millions of women in the United States. ACOG estimates that one-third of women will seek treatment for AUB, which would represent approximately 18 million women of the 55 million women between the ages of 25 to 50 in the U.S., as of 2019. In addition to the existing patient population with AUB, we estimate that approximately 750,000 women in the U.S. that will suffer from AUB enter the 25 to 50 age group each year, representing a potential annual recurring market opportunity of over $900 million. We believe we are well-positioned to serve this patient population and that our solutions have the potential to further change the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for AUB in patients that are not contraindicated for endometrial ablation. The Minerva ES and Genesys HTA, like all endometrial ablation products, are contraindicated in certain patients, including, but not limited to, those who are pregnant or who want to become pregnant in the future.
Menstruation
Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the endometrium, or the lining of a woman’s uterus. The endometrium is made up of two layers, the functional layer and the basal layer, and each month in preparation for a possible pregnancy, the basal layer generates a new functional layer. If a woman is not pregnant, the functional layer sheds and the period during which the functional layer is shed is referred to as menstruation. The shedding of this functional layer results in menstrual bleeding, which normally lasts from four to seven days and results in average blood loss of 30 ml per menstrual cycle. The entire menstrual cycle normally occurs within a 21-to 35-day period and the basal layer begins to regenerate a new functional layer in preparation for the next menstrual cycle. The normal menstrual cycle begins at the onset of menstruation, which typically occurs around the age of 12, and continues through the onset of menopause, which typically occurs around the age of 51.
Overview of AUB
AUB is characterized by menstrual blood loss in excess of 80 ml per menstrual cycle, which is two to three times the average blood loss during a normal menstrual cycle. Women who suffer from AUB typically experience a menstrual cycle that is shorter than the normal 21-to 35-day cycle, and often bleed for eight or more days during each menstrual cycle. AUB can have a significant impact on a woman’s quality of life. Women suffering from AUB typically need to change their sanitary products every two hours or less and

pass blood clots the size of a quarter or larger. When left untreated, AUB can keep women from engaging in ordinary daily activities during menstruation, which interferes with their family, social, personal, and professional lives. Prolonged bleeding can result in fatigue and, in extreme cases, anemia. AUB is caused by a variety of factors, including hormone imbalances and the presence of pathologies in the uterus, such as fibroids and polyps.
We believe that while the prevalence of fibroids and polyps is known to vary as a function of patient age and race, during the span between ages 25 and 50, the overall distribution between structural and non-structural causes is approximately equal. In 2011, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) introduced the PALM-COEIN classification system to establish the causality behind AUB. This classification is based on clinical- and imaging-based stratification into the structural (PALM) and non-structural causes (COEIN) of AUB:
•PALM (Polyp, Adenomyosis, Leiomyoma, and Malignancy and hyperplasia): PALM describes the structural causes of AUB, which can be diagnosed by imaging or histopathological evaluation. Among the structural causes of AUB, endometrial polyps and leiomyomas, or uterine fibroids, are most common. Endometrial polyps are hyperplastic overgrowths of cells in the endometrium, which are typically noncancerous, and are often seen in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths of the smooth muscle tissue of the uterus that often appear during childbearing years, and are the most common pelvic tumor in women.
 •COEIN (Coagulopathy, Ovulatory dysfunction, Endometrial dysfunction, Iatrogenic and Not yet classified): COEIN describes the non-structural causes of AUB, which cannot be diagnosed by imaging because identifiable structures that cause the bleeding are absent. As such, diagnosis depends on the patient’s medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Endometrial dysfunction is prevalent among the non-structural causes of AUB and is considered after exclusion of structural causes.
 The diagram below depicts a woman’s reproductive system and possible structural causes of AUB:
 


Existing treatments and their limitations
 Treatment for AUB is dependent on a number of factors, including the underlying cause of AUB, the patient’s desire for future fertility, and the anatomy of the uterine cavity. The current treatment pathway for patients suffering from AUB typically begins with medical management or drug therapy, to help manage symptoms. When drug therapies are not effective or where the side effects are intolerable, patients may progress to surgical management, such as endometrial ablation for non-structural causes, or tissue resection for structural causes. If endometrial ablation or tissue resection fail, or are contraindicated, physicians may recommend a hysterectomy, where the uterus is surgically removed. While tissue resection preserves fertility, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy are only an option for patients for whom childbearing is complete.
 Drug therapy. Drug therapy has traditionally been the initial treatment for AUB. Hormonal drugs, such as estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives and drug eluting intrauterine devices (IUDs), are most commonly used to alter the normal menstrual cycle with the objective of reducing bleeding, menstrual pain, or cramps, and provide contraception, if needed. When effective, the patient is typically required to continue drug therapy until menopause. Use of drug therapy can present increased risks and is not recommended for women who smoke, have diabetes with vascular involvement, a history of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, or an elevated risk of thrombosis. Many women being treated with hormonal drugs also experience side effects such as hot flashes, nausea, weight gain, mood swings, and depression, as well as other longer-term side effects. For these reasons, we believe many women are reluctant to continue long-term drug therapy.
 Endometrial ablation. First-and second-generation endometrial ablation procedures are less invasive, surgical alternatives to a hysterectomy that ablate the endometrium and underlying basal layer.
 •First-generation procedures. Historically, these procedures have required pre-treatment to thin the endometrium, such as a drug treatment several weeks in advance of the treatment, or a surgical procedure the day of treatment. During treatment, the uterus is distended through the use of hypotonic fluid, a hysteroscope, and a resectoscopic electrosurgical instrument, such as a rollerball or wire loop, or a laser, to ablate the endometrium and underlying basal layer. This is a procedure that takes approximately thirty 


minutes, is typically performed under general anesthesia, and requires a high level of surgical skill; therefore, it is rarely performed today. First-generation procedures can result in significant adverse events, including uterine perforation, which can cause damage to the bowel and other organs, and hemorrhaging of uterine blood vessels. Other reported complications include infections, thermal injuries, and hyponatremia (an excessive absorption of fluids), any of which can lead to seizures, congestive heart failure, brain damage, or death.
 •Second-generation procedures. These procedures are non-resectoscopic treatments, including those performed with the Minerva ES and Genesys HTA, which were developed to address many of the limitations, complications, and costs related to drug and first-generation surgical therapies. In general, these treatments use a surgical device that is inserted trans-vaginally, and through the cervical canal into the uterus to deliver energy to the uterine cavity and concurrently ablate (destroy) the entire endometrium and the underlying basal layer in a single treatment cycle. Other than the Minerva ES, commercially available devices use a single energy source, such as radiofrequency energy, cryogenic, or direct thermal conduction, each of which have shortcomings that can limit their efficacy. The leading competitor utilizes a coarse metallic mesh to deliver energy to the endometrial wall. This material can present surgical complications, such as the metallic mesh sticking to the ablated uterine tissue. Second-generation procedures are faster, require less general anesthesia or pre-treatment and, in most cases, allow for reduced complication rates when compared to first-generation procedures. However, the potential for complications still exists, including perforation of the uterus, thermal injury to adjacent tissue and organs, hemorrhaging, and infection.
 •Hysteroscopic tissue removal. Hysteroscopic tissue removal is a mechanical approach for polyp or uterine fibroid resection performed under local or general anesthesia, using a hysteroscope and distension fluid for direct visualization inside the uterus. This procedure is frequently implemented as the first-line approach for the surgical management of structural causes of AUB; however, there are significant complications to this procedure, including uncontrolled bleeding, infection, fluid overload, and perforation of the uterus. These limitations are inherent to the fundamental design of hysteroscopic tissue removal systems, in which a “cold-knife” approach is used to mechanically resect the tissue without the capability to control bleeding, thereby compromising the procedure safety and extending the procedure and anesthesia time. In addition, older systems require the use of multiple three-liter bags of distension fluid as well as additional equipment for strict fluid deficit accountability and management. This latter requirement is necessary to avoid patient injury, can be difficult for adjunct nursing personnel, and can result in higher overall procedure cost.
 •Hysterectomy. Hysterectomy, or surgical removal of the uterus, is performed when a patient has not responded to drug therapy or less invasive surgical procedures, or the patient is not a candidate for such procedures. Hysterectomy surgery must be performed under general anesthesia and typically requires from 90 minutes to several hours to complete. Patients then typically require approximately three days of hospitalization and six to eight weeks of recovery time prior to resumption of normal activities. Hysterectomy can result in serious complications, including blood clots, excessive blood loss, damage to adjacent organs, infection, and death. Additionally, hysterectomy can also result in significant long-term complications, including urinary infections and incontinence, loss of sexual desire, chronic constipation, fatigue, and psychological depression.
 Our broad suite of endometrial ablation and tissue resection devices are utilized in procedures that address the most common causes of AUB in most uterine anatomies. We have commercialized advanced devices that we believe have the potential to reduce risks of non-adherence to drug therapies, address several of the limitations associated with other device-based alternatives and preserve the uterus by avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. We believe our broad portfolio of products can be used in a variety of medical treatment settings and has the potential to further transform the treatment paradigm and become the standard of care for women suffering from AUB.

Key benefits for patients and healthcare providers
Our goal is to become the clinical leader in the treatment of AUB. We believe that our AUB solutions offer the following benefits:
•Improved quality of life. Our solutions are designed to improve the quality of life for millions of women suffering from AUB by eliminating the pain and life disruption of unwanted, excessive menstrual bleeding and reducing the rate of unnecessary hysterectomies. Our flagship product, the Minerva endometrial ablation system, has received noteworthy patient satisfaction scores, as compared to traditional rollerball treatment methods, as part of our clinical studies. In our Single-Arm Study, the overall patient satisfaction with the procedure was approximately 98%, 97%, and 99% at 12-, 24-, and 36-months follow-up, respectively. Nearly 99% of the patients stated that they maybe or definitely would recommend the Minerva procedure to a friend or a relative at 12 months, and 100% reported that they maybe or definitely would recommend the Minerva procedure at 24 and 36 months.
 •Enhanced patient safety. The proprietary safety enhancements of our solutions were designed to reduce the procedural risks associated with endometrial ablation and tissue resection. For example, our Symphion features bladeless resecting and on-demand spot coagulation designed to reduce risk of intra-operative bleeding. It also features an innovative fluid management system that is designed to detect a uterine perforation, prevent distension media overload, and automatically regulate the flow of fluid to help prevent uterine cavity collapse. In addition, our Minerva ES uses a patented two-stage uterine integrity test (UIT) featuring CO2 extension tubes that extend along the entire length of the soft, silicone array, enhancing detection of uterine perforations. 
 •Favorable clinical outcomes. Our PMA-approved products have been clinically evaluated for their potential to improve clinical outcomes in treating AUB. In our Single-Arm Study, the Minerva endometrial ablation system demonstrated a statistically significantly greater success rate at one-year follow-up, compared to the OPC. Additionally, in our Single-Arm Study, the Minerva endometrial ablation system resulted in a hysterectomy rate of 0.9% after 36 months. 
 •Intuitive design and procedural ergonomics. We believe the intuitive and ergonomic design of our solutions enables a rapid learning curve and fast adoption of our products across a wide range of medical treatment settings, including the hospital, ASCs, and physician offices. These attributes may also enable the acceleration of our minimally invasive solutions used in lower acuity treatment settings. 
 •Increased patient comfort and convenience. Our minimally invasive solutions are engineered to improve the patient’s experience by reducing procedure and recovery times. Our Minerva ES cervical sealing balloon produces a tight cervical seal 


that minimizes CO2 leakage, streamlining the treatment to reduce procedure time to approximately three minutes. It also features a soft, silicone array which minimizes the array sticking to uterine tissue and therefore reduces related discomfort during insertion and eases removal of the device. Procedures using our products are typically done on an outpatient basis with patients reporting that they are able to resume normal activities within a day.
Minerva ES
Our endometrial ablation system received PMA approval in July 2015 to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in pre-menopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding) due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete. The Minerva ES features a disposable handpiece and a controller to deliver plasma energy to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus. The Minerva ES treatment is a short procedure lasting approximately three minutes, which is performed on an outpatient basis or in-office setting, reducing the need for general anesthesia. Patients typically recover quickly and have reported that they are able to resume normal activities within a day.
The below image depicts our Minerva ES Endometrial Ablation System:


a.Minerva ES handpiece: Ergonomic and easy-to-use single-use handpiece.
 b.System controller: Continuously monitors tissue impedance (50 times per second), decreasing energy output in real time for a tailored ablation customized to each individual patient. 
 c.Cervical sealing balloon: Conforms to the cervix for a hands-free, reliable seal at the uterine opening.
 d.Plasma Formation Array (PFA): Soft silicone array opens without excessive manipulation or seating, and is designed to help prevent tissue from sticking to the array. 
 e.Activated PFA: Argon gas contained in the array is ionized to create plasma that seeks out least ablated tissue. 
 Our slender, single-use handpiece features an ergonomically designed handle, a cervical sealing balloon, a cervical sheath, and a PFA. The PFA is a soft and stretchable silicone membrane that allows easy insertion, deployment, and removal from the uterine cavity. It is designed to ablate uterine tissue to an appropriate and uniform depth, independent of the thickness of the endometrium. The Minerva ES is a low-power system and does not utilize a coarse metallic mesh, which we believe reduces potential for complications related to the array sticking to uterine tissue.
The Minerva ES controller uses our proprietary PlasmaSense technology to customize energy output and consistently deliver the optimal dose of power by continuously adjusting it during the procedure in real time as a function of the many variables unique to each individual uterine cavity. This bi-polar RF system generates a high voltage electrical field to ionize high purity argon gas, which is a common element in our atmosphere, turning it into plasma energy. This hot plasma heats the PFA silicone membrane to both ablate the tissue it contacts and also heat any intra-cavitary fluids, that then ablate areas of the uterine cavity not in direct contact with the PFA. As tissue is ablated, resistance, or impedance, of the tissue increases. Our PlasmaSense technology continuously monitors

impedance throughout the uterine cavity (50 times per second) to dynamically direct plasma energy to the least ablated tissue as measured by areas of lowest impedance. As the ablation cycle progresses, the area of tissue still requiring ablation becomes smaller. Our PlasmaSense technology dynamically reduces the total power dosage in an effort to prevent the uterine cavity from being overwhelmed with energy. This modulated power dosage allows for a uniform depth and complete ablation that is customized to each individual patient. The below images depict the modulated power dose from the plasma initiation phase to treatment completion:



Our PlasmaSense technology is able to respond in real-time to the ablation progression unique to each uterine cavity. Our leading competitor is a conventional RF energy-based endometrial ablation system, which use a fixed power level, calculated by multiplying the pre-measured surface area of the uterine cavity by 5.5 watts to determine the power level needed for patient of such cavity size. Once determined, this power level is constant and does not change during the length of the ablation procedure.
The Novasure device provides up to approximately 180 watts of RF energy, with the actual power determined by the size of the uterine cavity. The below images depict our power level and the real-time dynamic change in power level compared to the fixed, constant power employed by the Novasure device in a typical endometrial ablation procedure for a uterine cavity that is 6 cm in length and 4 cm in width.


Minerva ES—Dynamic Power | Novasure—Static Power

 
In addition to the real-time dynamic change in power level, use of our PlasmaSense technology results in much less total energy being delivered to the patient, where total energy is the product of power and time and is represented by the purple area under each of the power curves in the charts depicted above. In the case of these two graphs, as an example, the total amount of energy delivered to the patient during a Minerva ES procedure is approximately one-third of what is used by the leading competitor.
 Indications for use
The Minerva ES is indicated for ablation of the endometrial lining of the uterus in pre-menopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding) due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete.
Genesys HTA
Our time-tested Genesys HTA is a software-controlled hysteroscopic thermal endometrial ablation system that consists of an operational unit and a sterile procedure set. The Genesys HTA utilizes heated saline that is circulated throughout the interior of the uterus to ablate the endometrial lining. This method of ablation enables the treatment of non-structural causes of AUB in women, including those with a uterus of irregular shape or size, or with unusual anatomical features. The Genesys HTA treatment was designed to be quick, safe, and effective and provides the user with real-time visualization during the ablation cycle. Our Genesys HTA procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, reducing the need for general anesthesia. Patients typically recover quickly and have reported that they are able to resume normal activities within a day. The combination of our Minerva ES and Genesys HTA systems enables us to treat non-structural causes of AUB in a broad population of women.

The below image depicts our Genesys HTA Endometrial Ablation System:


a.Genesys HTA handpiece: Ergonomic and easy-to-use single-use handpiece. 
 b.ProCerva procedure sheath: Maintains a complete cervical seal, which is verified before procedure initiation and monitored during the ablation cycle. 
 c.Tapered “sieve” tip: Aids in debris handling and helps prevent clogging of device or tubing. 
 d.Controller: Displays step-by-step instructions and real-time procedure information, including time, temperature, and fluid loss monitoring.
 e.Cassette: Compact, disposable component that heats, filters, and controls fluid flow. 
 f.Hysteroscope*: Engineered for continuous direct visualization to enable treatment of a wider range of uterine cavities. *The hysteroscope is not included in the product offering, but available to physician offices. 
 Our Genesys HTA was designed for direct visualization and intuitive operation to deliver a versatile treatment for AUB. This system features a controller, intuitive graphical user interface, an adjustable-height pedestal, and a fixed-length intravenous fluid pole. Information on the display screen guides the user through each step, allowing for rapid set-up and procedural efficiency. The disposable procedure set was designed for ease-of-use and includes a cassette, a procedure sheath, and a drainage bag.
The Genesys HTA features a proprietary method of ablation that utilizes free-flowing heated saline that conforms to each patient’s uniquely shaped uterine cavity, thereby providing consistent treatment across most uterine shapes and sizes. Fluid is circulated by an impeller pump at 50 to 60 mmHg of pressure. The motor speed is preset and not adjustable by the user to ensure consistency. Fluid heating is regulated by our microprocessor-based controller and occurs in the disposable cassette via a heater with temperature sensors. Fluid temperature in the cassette is shown on the user-friendly display screen during heating, ablation, and cooling phases of the procedure.
Indications for use
The Genesys HTA is a hysteroscopic thermal ablation device indicated for ablation of the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia (excessive uterine bleeding) due to benign causes for whom childbearing is complete.
Symphion
The Symphion was designed to transform the way OB/GYNs remove uterine tissue. The Symphion consists of a controller, a disposable fluid management system, an endoscope, and a disposable resecting device. To our knowledge, the Symphion is the only minimally invasive solution to include three proprietary innovations that work as one. It combines bladeless resection and coagulation with novel recirculating fluid management and pressure monitoring technologies to provide OB/GYNs with what we believe is a differentiated surgical experience. The minimally invasive procedure performed with the Symphion requires no incisions. The

procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, during which minimal anesthesia is administered, and patients have reported that they are able to resume normal activities within one to two days. The Symphion is a fully integrated solution for resection and coagulation of uterine tissue designed to facilitate viewing with a hysteroscope during diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy. It also provides fluid management through the closed loop, recirculation of filtered distension fluid, which reduces patient risk for fluid intravasation overload. Based on the clinical research efforts to date, the Symphion technologic and procedural features may allow for reduction of the risk of complications and shortening recovery time.
Our Symphion uses a proprietary radio-frequency (RF) plasma cutting technology instead of mechanical cutting blades. The device is designed with a rounded end to reduce the risk of uterine perforation and features spot coagulation, which is unique to the Symphion. This feature allows the OB/GYNs to control bleeding and maintain adequate visualization during the procedure thereby enhancing the safety profile of the procedure. To our knowledge, it is the only system to directly monitor intrauterine pressure from inside the uterus and automatically regulate the flow of fluid to help prevent cavity collapse and maintain visibility.
The below image depicts our Symphion Tissue Removal System:


a.Disposable saline bag: One 3-liter saline bag volumetrically limits fluid overload. The system is intuitively designed to use no more than 2,500 ml of saline to reduce the possibility of fluid overload via intravasation and facilitates improved surgical workflow for nurses. 
 b.Fluid management accessories: Closed loop system that filters saline using a 0.005 micron molecular filter, limits fluid absorption, and enables continuous, clear visualization of the cavity.
 c.Controller: Integrated controller combines seamless resection and fluid management control in one system. 
 d.Foot switch: Integrated foot switch designed for OB/GYN’s ease-of-use that features a button to turn on fluid circulation, a yellow pedal to activate resection, and a blue pedal to activate spot coagulation to control bleeding for a clear and consistent view throughout the procedure. 
 e.Resection device: 3.6 mm resection device designed to enhance resection rate and efficiency. The technology features a bi-polar energized blade to allow for seamless resection of a wide spectrum of tissue types independent of their size and hardness. Additionally, the resection device features coagulation technology designed to minimize blood loss. 


f.Hysteroscope: 6.3 mm hysteroscope has four separate channels designed to address the common challenges of surgery: visibility, uterine cavity collapse, inadequate aspiration, and the ability to directly monitor uterine pressure. 
 The below image depicts in more detail the key features of our proprietary resection device and hysteroscope:
Resection device


1. Axially reciprocating RF plasma resection cutting tip (also serves as a coagulation electrode when in coagulation mode) 2. Large cutting window enables fast resection and aspiration 3. Cutting tip guide plug helps ensure reliable and effective aspiration of resected tissue 4. Orientation marks facilitate proper positioning of cutting window 

Hysteroscope


1. Outflow/working channel for tissue resection and aspiration 2. Inflow channel enables adequate inflow of saline 3. Camera lens to enable procedure visualization and guidance 4. Dedicated uterine pressure sensor channel 

 Indications for use
The Symphion is indicated to distend the uterus by filling it with saline to facilitate viewing with a hysteroscope during diagnostic and operating hysteroscopy and provide fluid management through the closed loop recirculation of filtered distension fluid. It is also intended for resection and coagulation of uterine tissue, such as intrauterine polyps and myomas, using a bipolar resecting device.
Resectr
 Resectr is an easy-to-use, minimally invasive surgical device used in hysteroscopic polypectomies providing OB/GYNs the ability to remove multiple polyps under direct visualization with one entry into the uterus. Resectr comes in two different sizes and provides the OB/GYN with a cost effective and highly functional tool for treating very common structural causes of AUB. Tissue removal with the Resectr device is a simple, minimally invasive surgical procedure that does not require hospitalization and, in many cases, can be completed in a doctor’s office for both comfort and convenience.
When using Resectr, OB/GYNs are able to both see and treat polyps that may need to be removed. Resectr is an oscillating resection device that works with existing fluid management systems, uterine wall suction, and hysteroscopes. Each resecting blade is bi-directional, internally rotating, and oscillating, to provide six rotations per handle squeeze and release cycle.

The below image depicts our Resectr Tissue Resection Device:


a.Ergonomic handle: Designed to alleviate tension and pressure on the user’s hands. 
 b.Rotating cannula: Ergonomic and intuitively designed to allow OB/GYNs the ability to position viewing window without rotating their hand. 
 c.Outflow port: Works with existing fluid management system, wall suction, and hysteroscopes. 
 d.Sheath: Available in 1.65 mm / 5 French OD (5Fr) and 3 mm / 9 French OD (9Fr) diameters for increased surgical flexibility. 
 e.Resection blade: Bi-directional and internally rotating blade to provide six rotations per handle squeeze and cycle release. Features drive-by-wire design to allow for continuous removal of tissue during resection. 
 Indication for use
The Resectr is indicated for intrauterine use by physicians trained in hysteroscopy to resect and remove tissue, including focal lesions such as endometrial polyps.
Our clinical results and studies
 OB/GYNs practice evidence-based medicine and rely on clinical data when making decisions to treat their patients suffering from AUB. We have developed a substantial body of clinical data, many of which have been published in peer-reviewed specialty journals. We believe our body of clinical evidence supports the safety and effectiveness of our PMA-approved products and strengthens our ability to facilitate adoption of our Minerva ES and Genesys HTA.
Minerva ES
 The safety, effectiveness, and clinical benefits of our Minerva endometrial ablation system were evaluated in two Company-sponsored clinical studies, the Minerva Single-Arm Study and the Minerva RCT, which collectively evaluated 263 patients enrolled at clinical centers in the United States, Canada, Hungary, and Mexico. The results from these studies served as the basis for the FDA approval of our PMA in July 2015 and the results from the Single-Arm Study and RCT were published in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. In addition, several other abstracts have been published on the safety and clinical benefits of our Minerva ES.
Summary of Minerva Single-Arm Study
Our Single-Arm Study was a Company-sponsored prospective, multi-center, single-arm, international clinical study of female patients between 25 and 50 years of age diagnosed with menorrhagia, or excessive menstrual bleeding. A total of 110 patients were enrolled across seven investigational centers in Canada, Hungary, and Mexico. Menstrual diary scores were collected pre-operatively and monthly for 12 months post-procedure. Long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes at 24 and 36 months were also collected for this study.
This investigation was designed as a single-arm study comparing the effectiveness of the Minerva endometrial ablation system with that of the FDA established objective performance criteria (OPC). The OPC was developed with input from industry and members of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel. The OPC incorporated data from the pivotal clinical trials of the five approved endometrial ablation systems, which we refer to below as the OPC comparison group. These five studies were randomized, controlled

trials that used the same active control, which was rollerball ablation, and had similar patient populations. The study sizes ranged from 260 patients to 322 patients, with either a 1:1 randomization or a 2:1 (device:control) randomization scheme. The primary endpoint was reduction in menstrual blood loss as assessed by a Pictoral Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBLAC). The inclusion criteria required either a baseline PBLAC score of greater than 150 (four studies) or greater than 185 (one study), and individual patient success was defined as a PBLAC score of 75 or less at 12 months post-procedure. The intent-to-treat population consisted of all patients randomized for either the endometrial ablation device or rollerball ablation. Patients with missing PBLAC scores at 12 months were treated as failures. A study was considered a success if the proportion of successes in the endometrial ablation device group met a pre-specified non-inferiority margin compared to the proportion of successes in the rollerball ablation control group.
The analysis of success rates for the five previously approved endometrial ablation devices was performed and provided by the FDA. Based on this success rate data (Her Option, 67.4%; Hydro ThermAblator, 68.4%; MEA, 87%; NovaSure, 77.7%; ThermaChoice, 80.2%), the average success rate for the OPC was 75.6%, with lower and upper 95% confidence bounds of 65.6% and 83.5%, respectively.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this study were consistent with those used for other endometrial ablation technologies in their respective FDA clinical studies.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was reduction in blood loss assessed using the time-tested and validated PBLAC menstrual diary scoring system. Patient success was defined as a reduction in PBLAC score from 150 or greater pre-treatment to a PBLAC score of 75 or less 12, 24, and 36 months post-procedure without incidence of acute treatment failure or additional therapy to control menorrhagia during the follow-up.
Efficacy results
Patient follow-up and compliance during this study were 100% completion of the 12-month visit and no patients lost to follow-up.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was to determine if the success rate for our Minerva endometrial ablation system was equal to or less than the OPC of 65.6%. In patients treated with our Minerva endometrial ablation system, the 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up success rates (heavy menstrual bleeding reduced to less than the normal level) were 91.8%, 91.9%, and 93.1%, respectively, and were statistically significantly greater than FDA-established OPC success rate of 66% (p < .0001). A secondary analysis performed using the same approach demonstrated that the success rate of the Minerva treatment was also statistically significantly greater than the OPC’s 95% upper confidence bound of 83.5% (p < .0001). The results are presented below:

Success rates | 12 months*(Total N = 110) | | 24 months**(Total N = 101) | | 36 months**(Total N = 101)

 N = total number of study patients; CI = confidence interval

 * Based on PBLAC diary scores
** Based on questionnaires
 Estimated number of successes using a regression multiple imputation procedure
The secondary effectiveness endpoints included amenorrhea rates (zero bleeding), patient satisfaction, treatment time, and anesthesia. Amenorrhea rates were evaluated using PBLAC diary scores during the first 12 months and based on responses to questions during the long-term follow-up an average of 4.8 years after the procedure. The amenorrhea rate was 66.4% and 57.4% at 12 months and an average of 4.8 years of follow-up, respectively. The results are presented below: 

Amenorrhea rate (At 12 months and greater than 36months post treatment) | | 12 months*(Total N = 110) | | | >36 months**(Total N = 101)

 N = total number of study patients; CI = confidence interval

 * Based on PBLAC diary scores
** Based on questionnaires; mean follow-up time 4.8 years
Patient satisfaction was also assessed at the 12-month follow-up, and out of those patients who responded to the survey, 97.6% (81/83) were satisfied or very satisfied with the Minerva procedure. Patient satisfaction during long-term follow-up was reported as 97.2%

(70/72) at 24 months, and 98.9% (92/93) at 36 months. In addition, at the 12-month follow-up interval, 98.8% (82/83) of patients stated that they maybe or definitely would recommend the procedure to a friend or a relative.
The mean procedure time from insertion of the Minerva handpiece to the time of removal was determined to be 3.9 ± 1.5 minutes. General anesthesia was administered to approximately 9% of patients. Over 57% of patients received a paracervical block with IV sedation and approximately 12% received IV sedation.
Premenstrual symptoms and dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain or cramps, were evaluated at baseline and following the Minerva procedure. At the 12-month follow-up, reduction in pre-menstrual symptoms was reported by 80.8% (84/104). At 24 and 36 months of follow-up, 65.3% (47/72) and 72% (67/93) of patients reported a reduction in pre-menstrual symptoms, respectively. For the same time intervals, 54.8% (57/104) of study patients who were treated reported a reduction in dysmenorrhea at 12 months, and 48.6% (35/72) and 55.9% (52/93) reported a reduction at 24 and 36 months, respectively.
Avoidance of hysterectomy
During the 12-month follow-up period, hysterectomy was avoided in 100% of study patients. Furthermore, no patients required any other additional medical or surgical interventions to control uterine bleeding. At 36 months of follow-up, hysterectomy was avoided in over 99% of study participants, with one patient undergoing hysterectomy between 12 and 24 months following the procedure for pre-existing pelvic pain unrelated to the endometrial ablation. No other hysterectomies were reported during the 36-month study period.
Safety results
The primary safety measure was based on the adverse events (AEs) reported during the study. AEs for the Minerva procedure were reported from the time of procedure through the 36-month follow-up. Serious adverse events (SAEs) included pelvic inflammatory disease, which was not observed during the follow-up period two weeks to 12 months post-procedure and pelvic cramping was observed in two patients (2.0%) during the follow-up period 12 to 36 months post-procedure. The type and rate of reported AEs were consistent with those commonly observed with endometrial ablation independent of the modality used.
Minerva Single-Arm Study conclusions
This multi-center study demonstrated that the Minerva system and procedure was well tolerated and produced results that were statistically significantly superior compared with the OPC. The Minerva procedure produced high amenorrhea and patient satisfaction rates, was fast, easy to use, and required less general anesthesia. We believe these results suggest that the Minerva endometrial ablation system could be considered a minimally invasive treatment method of choice since hysterectomy was ultimately avoided in all but one case.
The results of our Minerva ES Single-Arm Study as compared to the published results of the OPC comparison group studies are summarized in the table below. For the products in the OPC group, we have included the procedure times, amenorrhea rates, success rates, and hysterectomy rates. All of these important data are published in the FDA-approved Instructions for Use and Summary of Safety and Effectiveness documents for the respective products. Only success rate results were utilized by the FDA to establish the OPC that was utilized by the FDA in granting the Minerva ES PMA approval.

Summary of Minerva RCT study
Our RCT study was a Company-sponsored prospective, multi-center, randomized, international clinical study of female patients between 25 and 50 years of age diagnosed with menorrhagia, or excessive menstrual bleeding, who had received no endometrial pre-treatment. A total of 153 female patients were randomized 2:1 with 102 patients treated with the Minerva endometrial ablation system and 51 patients treated with rollerball ablation, as the control, at 13 investigational centers in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Menstrual bleeding data were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months post-procedure. Long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes at 24 and 36 months were also collected for this study.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this study were consistent with those used for other endometrial ablation technologies in their respective FDA clinical studies.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was reduction in blood loss as assessed using the Alkaline Hematin (AH) method, which is a validated, quantitative method of measuring blood loss by assessing the used sanitary products. Patient success was defined as a reduction in AH value ³ 160 ml to AH value £ 80 ml at 12, 24, and 36 months post-procedure without incidence of acute treatment failure or additional therapy to control menorrhagia during the follow-up.
Efficacy results
The 12-month follow-up success rate was 93.1% in the Minerva group and was demonstrated to be statistically significantly higher (Fisher’s exact test, p = .02) when compared to the 80.4% success rate in the control group. The results are presented below:


Success rate | | 12 months | 
 | Minerva ESN=102 | | | ControlN = 51 | p-value 
N (%) | | | 95 (93.1) | | 41 (80.4) | .02
95% CI | | | 86.4, 97.2 | | 66.9, 90.2

 N = total number of study patients; CI = confidence interval
The secondary effectiveness endpoints included amenorrhea rates, patient satisfaction, treatment time, and anesthesia. Amenorrhea rates, or no menstrual bleeding rates, were evaluated at 12 months based on AH value, or subject to certification of no bleeding during the 30-day period prior to the follow-up visit. The amenorrhea rate at 12-month follow-up was 71.6% (73/102) for the Minerva-treated patients and 49.0% (25/51) for the control group, with this difference also achieving statistical significance (Fisher’s exact test, p = .01). The results are presented below:


Amenorrhea* rates | | 12 months | 
 | Minerva ESN=102 | | | ControlN = 51
N (%) | | | 73 (71.6) | | 25 (49.0)

 N = total number of study patients; CI = confidence interval

* Based on AH value or patient’s written certification of no bleeding 30 days prior to 12-month visit
Patients were asked about their level of satisfaction with their endometrial ablation treatment for menorrhagia at the 12-month follow-up. A significantly higher rate of satisfaction was observed in the Minerva group at 91.9% versus 79.5% reported by the control group (Fisher’s exact test, p < .05). Patients were also asked if they would recommend the procedure to a friend or relative. At 12-month follow up, 94.9% (94/99) of the patients in the Minerva group and 88.6% (39/44) of patients in the control group said they maybe or definitely would recommend the procedure to a friend or relative with a similar problem.
The mean procedure time from insertion of the Minerva handpiece to the time of removal was determined to be 3.1 ± 0.5 minutes and was statistically significantly less than the procedure time for the control group, which was 17.2 ± 6.7 minutes (unequal variance t test, p < .0001). In addition, the mean cervical dilation for the Minerva group of 6.8 ± 1.1mm was statistically significantly less than the cervical dilation used for the control group, which was 9.3 ± 1.5 mm (t test, p < .0001).
The reduction of pre-menstrual symptoms at one-year post-procedure was slightly higher in the patients treated with the Minerva endometrial ablation system 53.5% (53/99) compared to the control group 43.2% (19/44). For the reduction in dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain or cramps, one year after treatment however, the outcomes were similar for the two groups, with the Minerva group showing 46.5% (46/99) and the control group 45.5% (20/44).

Safety results
The primary safety measure was based on the AEs reported during the study. AEs for the Minerva procedure were reported from the time of procedure through the 36-month follow-up. For the follow-up period from 12 to 36 months post-procedure, the only SAE (serious adverse event) considered to be related to the device or the procedure included one case of chronic pelvic pain secondary to hematometra. The percent of patients with one or more device- or procedure-related AEs was similar between the Minerva group compared to the control group during the 12-month follow-up period post-procedure. The most common AEs reported are set forth below.


Adverse Eventsand Symptoms | Follow-up period<24 hourspost-procedure | Follow-up period³24 hours to 2 weekspost-procedure | Follow-up period³2 weeks to 12 monthspost-procedure

 N = total number of study patients
Other clinical observations
During the 12-month follow-up period, hysterectomy was reported in 2.9% of patients in the Minerva group and 5.9% of patients in the control group, respectively. Compared with the Minerva group, a greater number of patients in the control group required additional medications, including oral contraceptives, tranexamic acid, or surgical treatment to control bleeding at one year. The rate of medical and surgical reintervention for excessive bleeding was 2.9% in the Minerva group, compared with 11.8% in the control group.
Long-term follow-up
Study participants were followed for a total of 36 months. A total of 88/102 (86.3%) of Minerva patients and 37/51 (72.5%) of patients in the control group completed the 36 months of follow-up, representing long-term retention rates similar or better than in other similar studies. Per FDA recommendations when conducting Intent-to-Treat (ITT) statistical analysis, all patients lost to follow-up were considered study failures, resulting in study success erosion for both arms of the study. However, the difference in success, amenorrhea, and patient satisfaction between the Minerva group and control group of the study remained statistically stable. The final study report has been submitted to the FDA and the results have been included in the product’s approved labeling.
Minerva RCT study conclusions
The results of this multicenter RCT demonstrated that at the 12-month follow-up, the Minerva procedure
produced statistically significantly higher rates of success, amenorrhea, and patient satisfaction, as well as a shorter procedure time compared with the “gold-standard” rollerball ablation. Safety results were similar for both procedures and showed that the Minerva procedure was well tolerated.
Genesys HTA
The safety, effectiveness and clinical benefits of our Genesys HTA were evaluated in a pivotal clinical trial, which included 276 patients enrolled in clinical centers in the United States. The results from this pivotal trial served as the basis for the FDA approval of a PMA in April 2001 and met all its primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints.

Summary of PMA Pivotal study
Our Genesys HTA pivotal study was a multi-center, randomized, concurrently controlled clinical trial. A total of 276 female patients across nine investigational centers in the United States were randomized 2:1 between the Genesys HTA device (HTA) or rollerball ablation, as the control, with 187 patients in the HTA group and 89 patients in the control group. Patients received one dose of Lupron 7.5mg on menstrual cycle day 21 ± 2 days and the procedure took place 19 to 27 days after injection and menstrual bleeding data were collected at baseline, two weeks, and 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. Long-term safety and effectiveness outcomes at 24 and 36 months were also collected for this study, and similar safety and effectiveness results were subsequently demonstrated in a number of clinical studies post-approval.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria used for this study were consistent with those used for other endometrial ablation technologies in their respective FDA clinical studies.
The primary effectiveness endpoint was reduction in blood loss assessed using the FDA standard and validated PBLAC menstrual diary scoring system. Patient success was defined as a statistical difference of <20% in patient success rates between the HTA and control group in the reduction in PBLAC score from 150 or greater pre-treatment to a PBLAC score of 75 or less at 12 months post-procedure. Subjects reporting amenorrhea (no menstrual bleeding), spotting, hypomenorrhea (less than normal menstrual bleeding), or eumenorrhea (normal menstrual bleeding) at 24 and 36 months were considered to have a successful outcome.
Efficacy results
The 12- 24- and 36-month follow-up success rates were 68%, 74%, and 68% for the HTA group, respectively, and 76%, 76%, and 70%, for the control group, respectively. Amenorrhea rates were also evaluated at 12, 24, and 36 months based on PBLAC diary scores. The amenorrhea rates at 12, 24, and 36 months were 35%, 37%, and 39% for the HTA group, respectively, and 47%, 38%, and 35% for the control group, respectively. The results are presented below:


Bleeding ratesN = 276 | HTAN = 187 | | ControlN = 89

* Based on diary score
** Based on questionnaire response
The secondary effectiveness endpoints included responses from a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. QoL scores at pre-treatment and 12, 24, and 36-months post-procedure for both HTA and control study groups are presented in the table below: 

Quality of Life (QoL) | HTA | | Control
Number of subjects who responded at 12 months | | 167 | | 83 
QoL score (mean ± SD) | | | | 
At baseline | | 54.2 ± 13.5 | | 53.3 ± 13.5
At 12 months | | 13.0 ± 15.0 | | 11.4 ± 15.2
Leisure activities affected | | | | 
At baseline | | 70.1% | | 66.3% 
At 12 months | | 21.6% | | 28.9% 
Work and activities of daily life affected | | | | 
At baseline | | 90.4% | | 91.0% 
At 12 months | | 19.8% | | 20.0% 
Number of subjects who responded at 24 months | | 151 | | 74 
QoL score at 24 months++ | | 11.0 | | 10.0 
Number of subjects who responded at 36 months | | 136 | | 67 


QoL score at 36 months++ | 5.0 | 4.5

 
 The QoL information was obtained from the Ruta QoL questionnaire, with a scoring scale range of 2.6 to 89.5. A higher score is associated with increased menorrhagia (e.g., mild = 37.6; moderate = 46.7; and severe = 50.7)
++ There is no standard deviation noted for 24 or 36 months
Safety results
Safety endpoints included AEs associated with each procedure, including device-related complications, time of procedure, and type of anesthesia used. AEs for both the HTA and control group were reported from the time of procedure through the 12 months of follow-up. AEs included transient change in appearance of the cervical epithelium, urinary tract infection (UTI), endometritis, hematometra, and thermal injury. The number of AEs was similar between the HTA group compared to the control group during the follow-up period three to 12 months post-procedure. There was a higher number of AEs in the HTA group compared to the control group at follow-up two weeks post-procedure. The most common AEs in the HTA group were uterine cramping, transient change in appearance of the cervical epithelium, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain.

 N = total number of study patients
Post-approval study
A multi-center, single-arm, performance goal, prospective registry study with 1,014 enrolled patients across 18 investigational sites was conducted using investigators experienced with the HTA system. The primary hypothesis of the post-approval study was that the patient rate of clinically significant burns was not significantly greater than 1.0%. The rate of clinically significant burns for the evaluated patient population was statistically significantly lower (p<.005) than the hypothesis rate of 1.0% with one clinically significant burn reported (0.1%). This result enabled preclusion of additional subject enrollment and the study ceased at 1,014 patients.
Post-market studies
The HTA system was subsequently evaluated in a large number of clinical research efforts, the results of which were published in over 76 peer-reviewed original research articles and abstracts. We believe these published results and decades of physician use have supported the validity of the data derived from the original FDA clinical study, demonstrating and re-confirming the safety and effectiveness of the HTA system.
Symphion
The safety, effectiveness, and clinical benefits of our Symphion system have been evaluated in several clinical studies that have resulted in seven publications in the peer-reviewed Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology. For example, we have interpreted the study results from Laberge P. et al. published in November-December 2014 to demonstrate that the procedure performed with the Symphion does not result in thermal damage that would be detrimental to future fertility. In an abstract published in November-December 2014, Brill et al. concluded that Symphion provides accurate fluid delivery in response to set pressure. According to an abstract published by Stockwell EL et al. in November-December 2016, Symphion had the least amount of variability when responding to changes in pressure compared to the external pressure monitors used in the Myosure and Truclear systems. We also have interpreted the abstract by Garcia A. et al. published in November-December 2014 to validate the safety of the Symphion in the office setting.
Resectr
Resectr’s effectiveness was evaluated by Demaegd, HMI et al., in an abstract published in the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology in November-December 2016, and we interpret the results of this study to demonstrate that the Resectr met the evaluators’ expectations regarding speed and simplicity of use with tissue resections occurring within less than three minutes.

Sales and marketing
We market and sell our products through a direct sales force in the United States. Our target customer base includes approximately 19,000 OB/GYNs practicing in hospitals, ASCs, and physician offices. Our commercial team works closely with our customers to ensure quality outcomes for their patients.
As of December 31, 2022, our commercial team consisted of approximately 89 field-based personnel that call on OB/GYNs in all major U.S. markets. Our sales force is organized by geographic territory and each sales territory is managed by one of our Territory Managers, who act as the primary customer contact and educate physicians in the use of our products. Most Territory Managers have extensive experience selling medical devices, generally focused on capital equipment and disposable devices used in the operating room environment. Our sales and marketing programs focus on educating physicians regarding the use of our products and on providing materials to help them educate their patients about our procedures. Additionally, we have implemented programs to assist physicians in raising patient awareness about the availability of alternative treatments for AUB by means other than drug therapy, other device-based procedures, and hysterectomy. We dedicate significant resources to educating physicians in the applicability and use of our solutions. We also provide online patient-oriented educational materials about AUB and our products and procedures, which patients may use to consider and then discuss treatment options with their physicians.
We believe that significant opportunities still exist for further targeted penetration into markets we currently serve, as well as the development of new sales territories. Our acquisition of BSC’s intrauterine health assets in May 2020 enabled us to offer a broader suite of products, each uniquely attuned to the needs of physicians so that they can treat a broader spectrum of patients. The acquisition also opened up new accounts, which had not been using the Minerva ES, to our commercial team. We believe the cross-selling opportunity for our highly complementary products will continue to accelerate our ability to reach a greater number of hospitals, physicians and patients while increasing productivity of our sales force and commercial infrastructure. Our ability to broaden and deepen our relationships with our existing and newly acquired accounts allows us to compete more effectively with our primary competitors.
We have and continue to plan to expand our commercial activities by recruiting and training additional field-based personnel in order to broaden awareness for and use of our products. We expect to continue focusing on increasing utilization of our products by existing customers and expanding our customer base. We seek to recruit sales and marketing employees with strong sales backgrounds, with direct experience with medical device products and an understanding of the reimbursement process. We believe investing in a scalable, highly focused direct sales force and continuing the development of our marketing efforts will help us increase adoption of our solutions, driving continued revenue growth and market penetration.
We intend to continue to promote awareness of our products and the solutions they provide by educating OB/GYNs. We plan to continue to develop our relationships with credible third parties, such as ACOG and AAGL, focusing on patient and physician education. We also intend to continue helping physicians in their outreach to patients and other healthcare providers. In addition, we intend to continue to publish additional clinical data in various industry and scientific journals and through presentations at various industry and healthcare conferences. We believe that many patients suffering from AUB are eager for the solutions that our products can provide. We also intend to continue direct-to-patient education through our website and other means, where patients and their physicians can find educational materials about our products, determine if they are eligible, and find contact information for OB/GYNs who perform procedures with our products.
Research and development
Our research and development team evaluates new product opportunities, product enhancements, and alternative applications of our proprietary technology. These activities are undertaken to improve patient outcomes and expand our addressable market. The research and development team also focuses on simplifying and automating the manufacturing process, reducing manufacturing costs, and improving yields. We intend to leverage our core technologies to develop and expand our product offerings through development of new products and technologies, improvement of our existing portfolio of products and acquisition of complementary products. For example, our team is currently focused on evaluating options to expand our Symphion product line in order to provide a broader set of compatible solutions for our Symphion controller that will provide additional procedure solutions at a number of different price points.
Current and future research and development efforts will also involve sustaining engineering activities focused on continued enhancements and cost reductions for our other products. Our research and development team is working on product manufacturability and reliability enhancements across all product lines in order to further enhance our products’ ease-of-use and overall system reliability for our customers.


Manufacturing and supply
Our products are manufactured, assembled, and packaged in various locations across the United States, China, Taiwan, Germany, and Costa Rica. We rely on a combination of in-house finished product manufacturing and third-party contract manufacturer organizations to produce our products. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the raw materials, components, and sub-assemblies used in our products. Our corporate headquarters in Santa Clara, California supports in-house production and distribution operations, including manufacturing, quality control, raw material, and finished goods storage. We also use a contract third-party logistics partner (3PL) in Memphis, Tennessee to provide additional distribution operations.
Our product lines include four device systems and the main composition of each system is as follows:
•Minerva ES Endometrial Ablation System: controller and single-use disposable handpiece. 
 •Genesys HTA Endometrial Ablation System: controller and single-use disposable ProCerva procedure set. 
 •Symphion Tissue Removal System: controller, hysteroscope, single-use disposable Fluid Management Accessory (FMA), and single-use disposable resecting device. 
 •Resectr Tissue Resection Device: single-use disposable 5Fr and 9Fr devices. 
 We rely on third-party contractors to manufacture components of our Minerva ES disposable handpiece, while we conduct the final assembly of the handpiece at our Santa Clara facility. We are in the process of establishing a contract manufacturer in China to act as a second source for the final assembly of the disposable handpiece. We anticipate the new contract manufacturer will be operational in the first half of 2023 pending FDA approval. We have the Minerva RF controller manufactured in the United States for use with our single-use disposable handpiece. In most cases these manufacturers are single source suppliers. Our controllers are tested and packaged at our Santa Clara facility and then placed in finished goods inventory.
 We transferred the manufacturing of the Genesys HTA controller from BSC to a third-party contract manufacturer and received FDA approval for the transfer. Additionally, we transferred the manufacturing and sterilization of the Genesys HTA ProCerva procedure set to third-party contract manufacturers and are waiting for FDA approval for these transfers. BSC has agreed to supply additional products on commercially reasonable terms through March 2022 in order to ensure a smooth transition to the third-party contract manufacturers which we expect to complete before year end.
Our Symphion and Resectr supply chains will remain unchanged from the processes that were in place at the time we acquired these assets from BSC pursuant to the asset purchase agreement (APA) (described below). Our Symphion product line will continue to be produced by contract manufacturers in the United States, Germany, and Costa Rica. Our Resectr continues to be assembled by a contract manufacturer in the United States.
We have a standard operating procedure for supplier evaluation and monitoring. We depend on a limited number of single-source suppliers to manufacture our components, sub-assemblies, and materials, and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers, which makes us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These single source suppliers provide us with dual pressure sensor monitors, plasma array balloons, custom injection molded and ceramic parts, hollow fiber filters, and complex programmable logic devices, among others. These components, sub-assemblies, and materials are critical and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply. We have not qualified or obtained necessary regulatory approvals for additional suppliers for most of these components, sub-assemblies, and materials and we do not carry a significant inventory of these components.
Many of our third-party contractors are single-source suppliers. We have supply agreements with our contract manufacturers while procuring our materials on a purchase order basis. Order quantities and lead times for components purchased from suppliers are based on our forecasts derived from historical demand and anticipated future demand. Lead times for components may vary depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components, specific supplier requirements, and current market demand for the components, sub-assemblies, and materials. Suppliers are routinely evaluated, qualified/re-qualified, and approved based on industry standards and through a stringent supplier management program including on-site audit, as required. This qualification process includes various evaluations, assessments, qualifications, validations, testing, and inspections to ensure the supplier can meet acceptable quality requirements. We have a strict change control policy with our suppliers to ensure that no design or process changes are made without our prior approval. Our current suppliers are capable of continuing to meet our specifications while maintaining high quality standards. We typically maintain one to two months of finished product in inventory.
We moved to our current Santa Clara facility in April 2020. Our manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to regulatory requirements of the FDA’s QSR for medical devices sold in the United States, set forth in 21 CFR part 820. We are also subject to applicable local regulations relating to the environment, waste management, and health and safety matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment, transportation, discharge, disposal, sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment, and remediation of hazardous substances. The FDA monitors compliance with the QSR through periodic inspections of our facilities, which may include inspection of our suppliers’ facilities as well. We believe our manufacturing operations in Santa Clara and the manufacturing operations of our subcontractors are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA, QSR requirements, and

other governmental regulators. We believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated manufacturing needs for at least the next two years.
Our failure, or the failure of our third-party suppliers, to maintain acceptable quality requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations or the recall of our products. If one of our suppliers fails to maintain acceptable quality requirements, we may have to qualify a new supplier, which could adversely affect manufacturing of our products and result in manufacturing delays as well as have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
Our agreements with Boston Scientific Corporation (BSC) related to the acquisition of the Genesys HTA, Symphion, and Resectr assets are as follows:
Asset Purchase Agreement (as amended)
We entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with BSC and certain of its affiliates on April 28, 2020, which was subsequently amended on May 14, 2021 and September 9, 2021 (the BSC Purchase Agreement), pursuant to which we purchased the right to certain products and technology for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding (the Transferred Intellectual Property), including the Genesys HTA, Symphion, and Resectr (collectively, the IUH Products), in exchange for 1,331,411 shares of our Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock and an aggregate amount in cash equal to $30.0 million, $15.0 million of which was paid at the closing on May 11, 2020. The remaining $15.0 million was paid after the completion of the IPO. In addition, the BSC Purchase Agreement contains three separate milestone payments for up to an additional $30.0 million that we may be obligated to pay through 2023 as described below:
•A revenue-based milestone payment equal to $5.0 million, if net revenue from the IUH Products is less than or equal to $30.0 million in calendar year 2021, and an additional $5.0 million if net revenue is greater than $30.0 million in calendar year 2021 (the First Revenue Milestone). The First Revenue Milestone was paid in the first quarter of 2022. 
 •A revenue-based milestone payment equal to $5.0 million, if net revenue from the IUH Products exceeds $30.0 million in calendar year 2022, and an additional $5.0 million if net revenue is greater than $37.0 million in calendar year 2022 (the Second Revenue Milestone). Revenue generated for IUH products did not meet the $30.0 million, as such the Second Revenue Milestone Payment did not take place.
 •A development-based milestone payment equal to $10.0 million, was earned when BSC delivered into finished goods inventory at least 20 Symphion controllers that were available for sale, at least 50% of which fully incorporated certain design revisions (the Development Milestone). We have agreed that this milestone was earned, and the Development Milestone was paid in November 2021, subsequent to the completion of the IPO.
 Minerva Out-License Agreement
In connection with the BSC Purchase Agreement, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with BSC on May 11, 2020, pursuant to which we granted BSC a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property rights transferred under the BSC Purchase Agreement (the Transferred Intellectual Property) within fields of use other than the intrauterine resection of tissue or the intrauterine ablation of tissue. BSC separately granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any improvement, enhancement, or modification made by or on behalf of BSC to the Transferred Intellectual Property, within the field of use relating to the intrauterine resection of tissue or the intrauterine ablation of tissue. Unless terminated earlier, the Minerva Out-License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of the last of the patents included in the Transferred Intellectual Property.
BSC Out-License Agreement
In connection with the BSC Purchase Agreement, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with BSC on May 11, 2020, pursuant to which BSC granted us an exclusive, royalty-free license to certain intellectual property rights (Licensed Intellectual Property), within the field of use relating to the intrauterine resection of tissue or the intrauterine ablation of tissue. We separately granted BSC a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any improvement, enhancement, or modification made by or on our behalf to the Licensed Intellectual Property, within fields of use other than the intrauterine resection of tissue or the intrauterine ablation of tissue. The BSC Out-License Agreement will remain in effect in perpetuity.
Transition Services Agreement
In connection with the BSC Purchase Agreement, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the TSA) with BSC on May 11, 2020, pursuant to which BSC must provide certain services, including IUH Products-related operations and transfer complaint processing and reporting, distribution services, finance, information technology, customer service, supplier management, regulatory matters, sales training, and marketing (collectively, the Seller Services) to us for a transitional period following completion of the sale of the Transferred Intellectual Property. With respect to any Seller Service, we must pay for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party costs or expenses incurred by or on behalf of BSC, any agreed-upon fees, and any taxes incurred. The TSA will end on the date on which all Seller Services have been terminated or are no longer being provided or because their terms have expired or, as to any particular Seller Service, upon the end of the time period set forth for such Seller Service in the TSA, whichever is earlier. All

Seller Services were completed in the second quarter of 2022. Each party to the TSA has the right to terminate it by written notice to the other if the other party is in material breach of its obligations and the other party fails to remedy that breach within 30 days after receiving written notice.
Supply Agreement
In connection with the BSC Purchase Agreement, we entered into a Supply Agreement with BSC on May 11, 2020 (the Supply Agreement), pursuant to which BSC agreed to manufacture and supply the IUH Products to us in accordance with our instructions, and we agreed to order the IUH Products using our form purchase order at agreed-upon product prices.
Unless terminated earlier, the Supply Agreement will continue in full force and effect until the expiration or termination of the TSA. Upon termination or expiration of the Supply Agreement, BSC must fulfill any open purchase orders and we must purchase all IUH Products subject to such open purchase orders, unless the termination was due to BSC’s breach of the Supply Agreement. In addition, we must purchase from BSC, at cost, all raw material and components used in the IUH Products and work in progress and finished inventory of IUH Products held by BSC at the time of termination or expiration of the Supply Agreement.
The Supply Agreement ended in the second quarter of 2022 concurrent with the end of the Transition Services Agreement.
 Competition
The medical device industry, including the market for the treatment of AUB, is highly competitive and subject to change. It is significantly affected by the introduction of new products and technologies and other market activities of industry participants. Many other methods exist for the treatment of AUB. Competing therapies utilize a variety of energy sources and delivery techniques. We currently face direct competition for the treatment of AUB primarily from Hologic, Inc., Medtronic plc, and CooperSurgical, Inc., each of which currently markets an FDA-approved endometrial ablation or tissue resection device. In addition to these devices, alternative treatments of AUB exist, such as drug therapy and hysterectomy.
As drug therapy is an alternative to our procedures, our competitors also include many major pharmaceutical companies that manufacture hormonal drugs for women. Some of our competitors that sell hormonal drugs or other devices for endometrial ablation and tissue resection are large companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, including:
•greater name recognition; 
 •established relationships with healthcare professionals, customers, and third-party payors; 
 •established distribution networks; 
 •additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives; and 
 •greater resources for product development, sales, and marketing. 
 We anticipate that other companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products and therapies. Current or future competitors may develop technologies and products that cost less or demonstrate better safety or effectiveness, clinical results, or ease of use than our products. Our products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product safety and proven long term effectiveness; 
 •strength of high-quality clinical evidence;
 •reliability and ease of use; 
 •customer marketing, service, and distribution;
 •effective physician and patient education;
 •physician, physician organization, and key opinion leader acceptance;
 •patient outcomes and feedback;
 •availability of reimbursement; and 
 •patent protection. 
 Our competitors may acquire or in-license competitive products and could directly compete with us. Competitors may also try to compete with us on price both directly, through rebates and promotional programs to high volume physicians, and indirectly, through attractive product bundling with complementary products that offer convenience and an effectively lower price compared to the total price of purchasing each product separately. Smaller companies could also launch new or enhanced products and services that we do

not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly. Additionally, certain of our competitors may challenge our intellectual property, may develop additional competing or superior technologies and processes and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we can. As companies develop new intellectual property in our market, there is the possibility of a competitor acquiring patents or other rights that may limit our ability to update our technologies and products which may impact demand for our products. In addition to competing for market share, we also compete against our competitors for personnel, including qualified sales and other employees that are necessary to grow our business.
Government regulation
United States Food & Drug Administration
Our products and operations are subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and its implementing regulations, as well as other federal and state regulatory bodies in the United States. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, record keeping and reporting, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, import and export, and post-marketing surveillance of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, approval from the FDA of a PMA, or receipt of de novo classification from the FDA. The 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, and de novo classification processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available.
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes – Class I, Class II or Class III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Minerva Surgical manufactures and provides for sale products that fall into each of the following three categories:
 •Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the general controls for medical devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of current good manufacturing practice regulations known as the Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful, and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. 
 •Class II devices are those that are subject to the general controls and special controls, as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents, and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. 
 •Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use or use advanced technology that are not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA process, which is generally more costly and time-consuming than the 510(k) process. 
 The 510(k)-clearance process
Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent,” as defined in the statute, to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees and for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2021, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification submission is $12,432.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device.
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process or

seek risk-based reclassification of the device through the de novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance or de novo classification, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA or de novo classification. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until marketing authorization is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k)-clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k)-clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.
More recently, in September 2019, the FDA finalized guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and will continue to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.
The PMA approval process
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling.
Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA, although in practice the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA will generally conduct pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA applications are also subject to the payment of user fees, which for fiscal year 2021 includes a standard application fee of $365,657.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer

might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
De Novo classification
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination.
Ongoing regulation by FDA
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
 •the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 
 •labeling regulations, advertising and promotion requirements, restrictions on sale distribution or use of a device, each including the FDA general prohibition against the promotion of investigational products or promotion of approved or cleared products for any uses other than those authorized by the FDA, which are commonly known as “off label” uses; 
 •requirements related to promotional activities; 
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;
 •medical device reporting (MDR) regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
 •FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulation; 
 •medical device corrections, recalls, and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufactures report to the FDA field corrections, recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health; 
 •device tracking requirements; and 
 •post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation, and 


servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled and unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of marketed products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or approval, or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory clearance or approval of our products under development.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties; been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to various interpretations. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Also, we may be subject to private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state and foreign laws described above or any other current or future fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results.
 United States healthcare reform
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenue, and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future products. The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, or expanding access. Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may limit coverage of or lower reimbursement for the procedures associated with the use of our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could impact our revenue from the sale of our products.
The implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, as amended, (ACA) in the United States, for example, has changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers substantially, and affected medical device manufacturers significantly. The ACA, among other things, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research, and implemented payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models. Additionally, the ACA expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs and created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration or other efforts, if any, to challenge, repeal and replace the ACA will impact the law or our business.

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included reductions to CMS payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through the end of 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced CMS payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
We believe that there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators, and third-party payors to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the rates we will be able to charge for our current and future products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our current and future products from governmental agencies or third-party payors. Current and future healthcare reform legislation and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

 U.S. coverage and reimbursement
In the United States, our currently cleared products are not separately reimbursed by any third-party payors and if covered, are paid for as part of the surgical procedure. Our commercial success depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for the procedures during which our products are used. Because there is often no separate reimbursement for products used in surgical procedures, the additional cost associated with the use of our products can impact the profit margin of the hospital or ASCs where the surgery is performed. As a result, failure by physicians, hospitals, ASCs, and other users of our products to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used, or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors’ coverage and reimbursement policies, may adversely impact demand for our products.
The process for determining whether a third-party commercial payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible.
Third-party coverage and reimbursement for endometrial ablation and tissue resection procedures performed in the hospital, ASCs or physician office setting is well established in the United States. These procedures are generally covered and reimbursed by private healthcare insurance and managed care payors.


Intellectual property
We actively seek to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, which includes seeking and maintaining patents covering our technology and products, proprietary processes and any other inventions that are commercially or strategically important to the development of our business. We also rely upon trademarks to build and maintain the integrity of our brand, and we seek to protect the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.
To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, and other intellectual property laws, employment, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and protective contractual provisions with our employees, contractors, consultants, advisors, suppliers, partners, and other third parties. We generally require our employees, contractors, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment, consulting or advisory relationships with us. We also generally require our employees, contractors, consultants, and advisors who we work with on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the scope of their work or services provided, using our property or resources or which related to our business. Despite any measures we take to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.
As of December 31, 2022, we owned 27 issued U.S. patents covering the Minerva ES, with expected expiration ranging from August 2029 to January 2038, not accounting for potentially available patent term adjustment or extension. We owned 17 issued U.S. patents and 24 issued foreign patents in Germany, Great Britain and Ireland covering the Genesys HTA, with expected expiration ranging from November 2028 to December 2035, not accounting for potentially available patent term adjustment or extension. We owned 24 issued U.S. patents and 31 issued foreign patents in France, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland covering the Symphion, with expected expiration ranging from October 2031 to April 2037, not accounting for potentially available patent term adjustment or extension. We owned five issued U.S. patents covering the Resectr, with expected expiration ranging from February 2031 to February 2036, not accounting for potentially available patent term adjustment or extension.
In May 2020, we acquired a portfolio of patents from BSC pursuant to the BSC Purchase Agreement. The patents acquired from BSC expire between March 2025 and October 2037. Some of the acquired patents were subject to a third-party license.
As part of the BSC Purchase Agreement, we also acquired licenses to patents that expire between June 2032 and March 2036. The patents and licenses acquired through the BSC Purchase Agreement cover our Symphion, Genesys HTA, and Resectr products.
We entered into a license agreement with Hermes Innovations, LLC (Hermes) in October 2008 (the Hermes License Agreement), pursuant to which Hermes has granted us a worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free license to certain of its patents related to tissue ablation to develop, manufacture, commercialize and otherwise exploit products covered by such patents, including our Minerva ES system, solely in the field of use of medical devices for treating a female patient’s uterus and fallopian tubes (Field of Use). Concurrently, we granted to Hermes a worldwide, perpetual, exclusive, irrevocable, paid-up, royalty-free license under all improvements we made between October 2008 and October 2011 relating to the licensed patent rights to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and otherwise exploit products covered by such improvements outside the Field of Use.
The Hermes License Agreement will expire upon the cancellation or expiration of the last-to-expire patent licensed to us. The last to expire of these patents will expire in August 2029.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 33 pending patent applications globally, including 20 in the United States and 13 outside the United States.
As of December 31, 2022, we had trademark registrations for “Minerva,” “Minerva ES”, “Symphion”, “Genesys HTA”, “Genesys HTA Procerva”, and “PlasmaSense” in the United States, and various other countries. Including these trademark registrations, our trademark portfolio contained 43 trademark registration applications.
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. For example, we are in litigation with Hologic, Inc., involving one of our patents. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Furthermore, even if our patents are found to be valid and infringed, a court may refuse to grant injunctive relief against the infringer and instead grant us monetary damages and/or ongoing royalties. Such monetary compensation may be insufficient to adequately offset the damage to our business caused by the infringer’s competition in the market. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” and “Item 3–Legal proceedings." below for more information on risks related to intellectual property litigation.
Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using the product, any of which could severely harm our business.
We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property and proprietary know-how as trade secrets, and generally require our partners to execute non-disclosure agreements prior to any substantive discussions or disclosures of our technology or business plans. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Facilities
Our corporate headquarters, research and development facilities, and manufacturing and distribution centers are located at 4255 Burton Drive, Santa Clara, CA 95054. The facility is approximately 33,000 square feet and is compliant with all relevant state and federal requirements. Our lease on this facility runs through May 2023. On July 29, 2022, the Company entered into a new non-cancellable operating lease arrangement for its current facility commencing on June 1, 2023 and will expire on May 31, 2028.We do not own any real property and believe that our current facilities are sufficient to meet our ongoing needs for at least the next two years and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
Human capital resources
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees and consultants into our company. As of December 31, 2022, we have 174 full-time employees in the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. We believe that our diverse backgrounds, unique strengths, talents, and viewpoints make up the fabric of a strong culture. We strive to maintain an environment which is collaborative, and provides for open communication and mutual respect.
Our people and culture objectives include identifying, recruiting, retaining, and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors, and consultants into our company and culture. We offer what we believe is an attractive mix of cash and stock-based compensation and benefit plans to support our employees and their families’ physical, mental, and financial well-being. Our compensation programs also help to increase stockholder value and contribute to the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our short- and long-term business goals. We have developed an equitable, merit-based total compensation and rewards program for our employees. Below are some of the benefits offered to employees, most of which become effective shortly following their start date:
•medical, dental and vision insurance; 
 •401K retirement plan; 
 •flexible spending accounts for medical expenses, childcare, parking, and transit; 
 •health savings accounts (with employer contribution); 
 •life insurance;
 •short & long-term disability; 
 •voluntary benefits; 
 •paid time off and leave of absences; 
 •employee assistance program; and 
 •wellness program. 
 We believe our personal and professional growth and development is key to our success. We invest in training, education and coaching for our employees. Our commercial team employees initially train for three weeks and subsequently continue ongoing professional development throughout their tenure to support our customers with high standards of quality and service.
 We are also committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. We are an equal-opportunity employer. We make employment decisions on the basis of a person’s qualifications, and our business needs. We believe in the richness and quality of a working environment that is diverse and inclusive.
Employee safety is a continuing priority. We provide assessment, identification, and implementation of measures to support the health and safety of our employees via our safety committee and external partners. We have maintained strict protocols and provided personal protective equipment during the pandemic to continue to successfully operate within the recommended CDC and local county health department guidelines.
 Seasonal Trends and Economic Incentives
 We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, revenue seasonality at the end of the year primarily due to the annual cycle around patient medical deductibles and co-payments. We have seen higher procedure volume in the second half of the calendar year for the past several years as our procedures have an elective element to them, and while the procedures in which our products are used are considered elective by many insurance companies, the procedures are fully reimbursed by virtually all private and government insurance payors. The desirability of our solution can be impacted by the availability and value of various governmental, regulatory and tax-based incentives which may change over time.
Corporate Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters and principal executive offices are located at 4255 Barton Dr, Santa Clara ,CA 95054, and our telephone number is (855) 646-7874. Our headquarters is used for administration, research and development, and sales and marketing and also houses one of our manufacturing facilities.
