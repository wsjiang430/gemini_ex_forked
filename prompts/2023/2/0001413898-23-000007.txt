Item 1. Business

DallasNews Corporation, formerly A. H. Belo Corporation, and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively herein as “DallasNews” or the “Company.” DallasNews was formed in February 2008 through a spin-off from its former parent company and is registered on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq trading symbol: DALN). DallasNews is the Dallas-based holding company of The Dallas Morning News and Medium Giant. 

The Dallas Morning News is Texas’ leading daily newspaper with a strong journalistic reputation, intense regional focus and close community ties. The company has won nine Pulitzer Prizes and is the oldest continuously operated business in Texas, dating back to 1842.

In addition, the Company has a full-service agency, Medium Giant, with capabilities including strategy, creative and media management with a focus on strategic and digital marketing, and data intelligence that provide a measurable return on investment to its clients.

Business Overview

The Company’s goal is to create value for investors by being the premier provider of relevant and original local journalism in North Texas so citizens can make informed choices about their lives and the life of the communities in which they live. This commitment to excellence in journalism attracts and retains subscribers to the print edition, the digital site, and applications.

The print media industry has encountered continuous declines in revenue primarily due to the secular shift of readers and advertisers to digital platforms. The Company has sought to limit its exposure to these industry risks through greater development of its digital platforms for delivery of news and advertising, and leveraging its brand and personnel to enhance its media agency solutions. However, these improvements may not result in a sufficient increase in revenue to offset the declines the Company is experiencing in its traditional print media business.

The Company operates The Dallas Morning News (dallasnews.com), Texas’ leading newspaper and various niche publications targeting specific audiences. These operations generate revenue from sales of advertising within the Company’s newspaper and digital platforms, subscriptions and retail sales of its newspapers, commercial printing and distribution services primarily related to national newspapers, and preprint advertising. 

The Dallas Morning News’ first edition was published on October 1, 1885. The News is one of the leading metropolitan newspapers in the United States. The newspaper is distributed primarily in Dallas County and five surrounding counties. This coverage area represents one of the most populous and fastest growing metropolitan areas in the country. The News has been awarded nine Pulitzer Prizes for news reporting, editorial writing and photography. The News also publishes Briefing and Al Dia, an award-winning Spanish-language newspaper, both distributed on Wednesdays at no charge to households in select coverage areas. Unless otherwise noted, the financial and operating results of all publications are reported as The Dallas Morning News.

Businesses producing and providing services within the print and newspaper industry have encountered significant declines in revenue as a result of increasing use of the internet for delivery of information. These businesses have been challenged to find alternative solutions to offset the loss of revenue. The majority of revenues within the newspaper industry were historically generated from display and classified advertisements followed by revenues from subscriptions and retail sales of newspapers. Revenues from subscriptions and retail sales of newspapers have experienced greater resilience as readers have been willing to pay higher prices for the product, which has substantially offset lower circulation volumes. The Company has faced ongoing revenue declines primarily in print advertising and expects these trends to continue. As a result the Company is moving to a more digital news format to offset some of its declines in print, specifically around advertising.

In addition to traditional print and digital advertising, the Company has a full-service agency, Medium Giant, with capabilities including strategy, creative and media management with a focus on strategic and digital marketing, and data intelligence that provide a measurable return on investment to its clients. Through the full-service capabilities, we are able to offer businesses comprehensive, strategic and creative marketing solutions which allow our clients to connect with their business, their brand and their audiences to drive growth. The Company has aligned management and its sales teams to provide a cross-functional integrated approach to maximize the development of these businesses. Digital marketing services are provided through the following service offerings:

Multi-channel marketing solutions through subscription sales of the Company’s cloud-based software, allowing customers to manage and individualize their marketing campaigns. In addition, multi-channel marketing services are provided to customers without access to the proprietary software. 

Digital and strategic marketing services, paid media strategy and management, and other marketing related services. Multi-channel digital advertising and marketing services campaigns for customers, allowing them to target demographic audiences using data analytics and determine the delivery media such as email campaigns, banner impressions or video views on third-party websites. 

The following describes the Company’s various revenue streams.

Advertising and Marketing Services Revenue - Advertising and marketing services revenue accounted for approximately 46 percent of total revenue for 2022.

The Company has a comprehensive portfolio of print advertising products, which include display, classified and preprint advertising. Display revenue results from sales of advertising space within the Company’s core newspapers and niche publications to local, regional or national businesses with local operations, affiliates or resellers. Classified revenue, which includes automotive, real estate, employment, obituaries and other, results from sales of advertising space in the classified and other sections of the Company’s newspapers. Preprint revenue results from sales of preprinted advertisements or circulars inserted into the Company’s core newspapers, niche publications, and distributed to publications in other markets, or distributed by mail or through third-party distributors to households in targeted areas in order to provide total market coverage for advertisers. The Company’s capabilities allow its advertisers to target preprint distribution selectively at the sub-zip code level in order to optimize coverage for the advertisers’ locations. Preprint advertising also includes other services revenue related to the Company’s niche publications.

The Company’s digital advertising and marketing services revenue consists of strategic marketing services, consulting, branding, paid media strategy and management, creative services, search optimization, direct mail and the sale of promotional materials, as well as providing multi-channel marketing solutions through subscription sales of the Company’s cloud-based software. In addition, it includes digital sales of banner, classified and native advertisements on the Company’s news and entertainment-related websites and mobile apps, as well as targeted and multi-channel (programmatic) advertising placed on third-party websites.

Circulation Revenue - Circulation revenue accounted for approximately 43 percent of total revenue for 2022 and includes subscriptions and single copy sales related to the Company’s core newspapers in print and digital formats. DallasNews’ steadfast commitment to producing superior, unduplicated local journalism enables the Company’s newspapers to charge premium subscription rates. The Dallas Morning News’ goal is to maximize the amount of recurring revenue from consumers of the Company’s print and digital products. The Company continuously assesses the journalism provided to subscribers and their willingness and ability to pay higher rates by geographic area. The Company has implemented effective rate increases to select subscribers or retailers. A digital replica version of The Dallas Morning News is offered for subscribers to purchase if they prefer to consume news through a digital device in a more traditional format. DallasNews’ newspapers and the newspaper industry as a whole are challenged to maintain and grow print circulation volume. To the extent circulation volume declines cannot be offset by rate increases, the Company will realize lower circulation revenue. Circulation volume declines could also result in lower rates and volumes for advertising revenue.

The Company’s news websites, including dallasnews.com and aldiadallas.com, are the leading English and Spanish news and entertainment digital platforms in the North Texas region. The news websites offer late-breaking and other up-to-date news coverage, user-generated content, advertising, e-commerce and other services. Readers can access news content across multiple digital platforms and obtain relevant local customized content and advertising. The Company’s journalists have expanded their reach and deepened their engagement with audiences by delivering news and content through social media platforms such as blogs, Facebook and Twitter, which direct traffic to the core websites. The Company’s success depends to a significant extent on its ability to develop and manage the digital business in response to the changes in consumers’ preferences and behaviors, as well as changes to advertising expenditures, as described above.

Printing, Distribution and Other Revenue - Printing, distribution and other revenue accounted for approximately 11 percent of total revenue for 2022 and includes commercial printing, distribution, and shared mail packaging services. The Company’s commercial printing and distribution services leverage the capacity of its production and distribution assets. The Company believes the incremental revenue from these services allows a greater return from the Company’s operating assets.

Commercial printing and delivery services are provided for certain national newspapers. A shared mail packaging business is operated in Tempe, Arizona, providing mailed advertisements for business customers.

Raw Materials and Distribution

The basic material used in publishing newspapers is newsprint. The Company has a Paper Supply Agreement, expiring in August 2025, with Gannett Supply Corporation (“Gannett”), a newsprint broker, which will be the Company’s sole supplier of newsprint from designated newsprint suppliers at market-based prices during the term of the agreement, except in certain specified instances. The agreement is renewable for successive one-year terms upon mutual agreement of the parties, and is terminable by either party on 180 days prior written notice. This agreement allows the Company access to multiple mills at competitive pricing. Prior to the Gannett agreement, the Company’s newsprint was obtained through a purchasing consortium. Management believes the Gannett agreement provides adequate sources of newsprint to meet the Company’s current needs. Significant increases in newsprint costs or the Company’s inability to obtain an adequate supply of newsprint in the future could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.

During 2022, Company operations consumed 7,735 metric tons of newsprint at an average cost of $728 per metric ton. Consumption of newsprint in 2021 was 8,405 metric tons at an average cost of $572 per metric ton.

The Company’s newspapers and other commercial print products are produced at its facility in Plano, Texas. Distribution of printed products to subscribers, retailers and newsstands is made under terms of agreements with third-party distributors. The Company believes a sufficient number of third-party distributors exist to allow uninterrupted distribution of the Company’s products. However, if third-party service providers face financial difficulties or terminate their relationship with the Company, this could adversely affect the Company’s ability to satisfy its customers or operate the business, and could affect results of operations.
Competitive Strengths and Challenges
The Company’s strengths include:
the largest news-gathering operation in North Texas
the opportunity to build valuable first-party data sets about consumers in North Texas due to the millions of unique visitors who come to the Company’s websites monthly

The Company’s challenges include:
timely growth of revenue and profits related to the Company’s agency, digital services and digital subscriptions businesses that would provide for an offset to declines in revenue and profits related to the Company’s print advertising and print circulation
operating in a competitive environment with increased competition from other media, particularly internet-based media provided to customers at no cost
effective monetization of locally-created online content on the Company’s websites while balancing the impact of potential lower traffic volumes with an established metered-based model

In response to the decline in print revenue, the Company has developed agency and digital advertising capabilities through multiple media channels. The Company leverages its news content to improve engagement on the Company’s digital platforms that results in increased digital subscriptions and associated revenue. The Company also continues to diversify its revenue base by leveraging the available capacity of its existing assets to provide print and distribution services for newspapers and other customers requiring these services, by introducing new advertising and marketing services products, and by increasing circulation prices. 

Because of declining print circulation, the Company has developed broad digital strategies designed to provide readers with multiple platforms for obtaining online access to local news. The Company continues to obtain additional key demographic data from readers, which allows the Company to provide content desired by readers and to modify marketing and distribution strategies to target and reach audiences valued by advertisers. The Company has access to programmatic digital advertising platforms that provide digital ad placement and targeting efficiencies and increases utilization of digital inventory within the Company’s websites. Additionally, in order to optimize owned and operated digital advertising revenue, the Company has adopted a holistic yield management approach powered by real-time bidding technologies and data analysis to ensure the optimal mix of direct sales and programmatic ad sales is achieved.

Competition

DallasNews’ newspapers, niche publications and related websites primarily serve audiences in the North Texas area. The Company competes for advertising revenue for its newspapers and websites with other print and agency companies. Advertising revenues for the Company’s newspapers and websites are responsive to circulation and traffic volumes, demographics of their subscriber bases, advertising results, rates and customer service. Advertising on digital platforms is highly competitive and largely dominated by large internet companies. As advertisers reallocate marketing expenditures from print to digital channels, the Company believes its strong local brand and its full-service agency, Medium Giant, has capabilities that will allow it to offer exclusive advertising and digital marketing solutions to local businesses on a competitive scale.

The Dallas Morning News has the highest paid print circulation in the North Texas area while competing with one other metropolitan newspaper in parts of its geographic market. Circulation revenues are challenged primarily due to free and readily-accessible news, entertainment, advertising and other content available through the internet. This secular shift from print to digital media continues as consumer lifestyles embrace technological advancements, particularly with mobile devices, which provide access to a wide variety of digital news and advertising alternatives, including news and social media websites, online advertising networks and exchanges, online classified services, and direct email advertising. Competition for readers is primarily based on mode of delivery, quality of the Company’s journalism, price, timeliness of interaction with audiences, and customer service. News and other digital content produced by the Company’s newspapers and niche publications are available via its websites, mobile applications and through email. The Company offers competitive technology for accessing digital content on mobile devices and via personal computers. Journalists engage online readers through blogs, Twitter and other social media posts. 

Seasonality

DallasNews’ advertising revenues are subject to moderate seasonality, with print and digital advertising revenue typically higher in the fourth calendar quarter of each year because of the holiday shopping season. The level of print and digital advertising sales in any period may also be affected by advertisers’ decisions to increase or decrease their advertising expenditures in response to anticipated consumer demand and general economic conditions.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 663 employees of which approximately 21 percent were represented by a labor union. The Company is in the process of finalizing an initial collective bargaining agreement. While there have not been any operational disruptions to date, the Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of these negotiations. 
The Company considers its relationships with its employees to be very good and is committed to an equitable and inclusive workplace that reflects the diversity of its local readers and the communities it serves.
