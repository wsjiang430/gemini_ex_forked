ITEM 1.    Business
General
Noodles & Company is a restaurant concept offering lunch and dinner within the fast-casual segment of the restaurant industry. Our core offerings include noodle and pasta dishes, staples of many different cuisines, with the goal of delivering fresh ingredients and flavors from around the world under one roof. Today, our globally-inspired menu includes a wide variety of high quality, cooked-to-order dishes, including noodles and pasta, salads, soups and appetizers. We believe that we offer our customers value, with per person spend of $12.50. As of January 3, 2023, we operated 461 restaurants in 31 states, which included 368 company locations and 93 franchise locations.
We offer approximately 20 globally-inspired and highly customizable dishes together on a single menu that can be enjoyed inside our restaurants, taken to-go, or delivered to our customers. We believe we will continue to benefit from recent trends in consumer preferences such as the increasing desire for convenience and to engage with brands digitally, as well as the broader demand for international cuisines. At many restaurants, customers are limited to a particular ethnic cuisine or type of dish, such as a sandwich, burrito or burger. At Noodles & Company, we aim to eliminate the “veto vote” by satisfying the preferences of a wide range of customers, whether a family or parent with kids, a group of coworkers, an individual or a large party.
Our menu is well suited for off-premise dining occasions in which customers order at our restaurant or online but then eat their meal from the comfort of their home or office. Our menu items travel particularly well, with a high variety of options to meet a broad range of lifestyle needs. In addition, our digital capabilities position the brand well for consumer trends focused on convenience. We also believe that our globally-inspired menu, focused on noodle and pasta dishes, differentiates us from other restaurants. We believe our attributes—global flavors, variety, dishes prepared-to-order and fast service—allow us to compete against multiple segments throughout the restaurant industry and provide us a larger addressable market for lunch and dinner than competitors who focus on a single cuisine. We strive to provide a pleasant dining, pick-up or delivery experience by quickly preparing fresh food with friendly service at a price point we believe is attractive to our customers. 
Noodles & Company is a Delaware corporation that was organized in 2002. Noodles & Company and its subsidiaries are sometimes referred to as “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” in this report. We refer to our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, as our “common stock.” 
Our Concept and Business Strengths
Convenience. Our customers experience the Noodles brand through our company-owned and franchise operated locations, through our website www.noodles.com and through our mobile app. In 2022, approximately 54% of our sales were derived from digital ordering, where guests have the opportunity to select in restaurant quick pick-up or delivery to their home or office. In select restaurants, particularly new locations, we offer the added convenience of order-ahead drive through windows. We believe that the breadth of ways that consumers can access our brand, the variety inherent in our menu, and how well our food travels is a business strength in relation to consumer trends towards convenience. 
Variety. We have purposefully chosen a range of healthy to indulgent dishes to satisfy multiple dietary and lifestyle preferences. Our menu encourages customers to customize their meals to meet their tastes and nutritional preferences with our selection of a variety of fresh vegetables and seven proteins. Additionally, customers are able to customize the noodle that their dish is prepared with, including healthy options such as our zucchini noodle (“Zoodles”), gluten free pipette noodle or the recently launched LEANguini noodle (“LEANguini”), which features significantly fewer carbs and more protein than a traditional wheat noodle.
All of our dishes are cooked-to-order with fresh, high quality ingredients sourced from our carefully selected suppliers. Our commitment to the freshness of our ingredients is further demonstrated by our use of fresh produce and healthy add-in options such as seasoned tofu. Our culinary team strives to develop new dishes and limited time offerings to further reinforce our brand positioning and regularly provide our customers with additional options. Choice and customization have always been a great strength of the brand, and we continue to innovate in ways that allow guests to enjoy the world flavors they know and love, as well as discover new ones with all of the benefits of healthier options. This focus on culinary innovation allows us to prepare and serve high quality food, meet changing consumer trends and acquire new customers. As we add healthy alternatives, we additionally from time to time introduce more classic noodle and pasta dishes, such as our Tortelloni.

Value. The quality of our food and the welcoming ambiance of our restaurants creates an overall customer experience that we believe is unique and differentiated. Our per person spend is competitive not only within the fast-casual segment, but also within the quick-service segment. Our digital menu available on our mobile app and website, features an Everyday Value landing page where guests can select an entry-level item for around $7 per dish. During 2022, we featured our Everyday Value menu through a brand marketing message called 7 for $7. In addition, we also offer kids meals which, at a fixed low price, provide the opportunity for parents to feed their children a balanced meal with sides such as broccoli, applesauce and a smaller portion of our house made rice crispy treat.
Our Brand Experience. Our locations are designed individually, which we believe creates an inviting restaurant environment. We believe the ambiance is warm and welcoming, with muted lighting and colors, comfortable seating and our own custom music mix, which is intended to make our customers feel relaxed and at home. We believe we deliver an exceptional overall dining experience. Our customers expect not only great food from our restaurants, but also warm hospitality and attentive service.
Consistent with our culture of enhanced customer service, we seek to hire, develop and retain individuals who will deliver prompt, attentive service by engaging customers the moment they enter our restaurants. Our training philosophy empowers both our restaurant managers and team members, also referred to as employees, to add a personal touch when engaging with our customers. Our restaurant managers are critical to our success, as we believe that their entrepreneurial spirit and outreach efforts build our brand in our communities.
Our guests also experience the Noodles brand through our digital platforms, including orders placed on our website or our mobile app, contactless and in-restaurant pick-ups and delivery through our own channels or a third-party aggregator. Our multi-channel approach allows us to adapt to potential changes in customer behavior, and has been strengthened by our investments in our off-premise channel, such as our elevated technology capabilities and our quick-pick up counters. Additionally, in some of our locations, we provide curbside pick-up available to our guests directly through our mobile app and website. Finally, the majority of our new locations have incorporated order ahead drive-thru windows to increase our level of convenience.
Our Operational Strategy 
We believe our brand and globally-inspired menu resonates with consumers, and we believe our restaurants, team members and online engagement provide customers a unique and high-quality experience. We are focused on offering customers flavorful, cooked-to-order dishes in a warm and welcoming environment at an attractive value.
Restaurant initiatives. Our plan to improve our performance includes the following four key strategies:
•Enhancing convenience for our customers. We have meaningfully improved convenience for customers during the past few years. In 2022, we revamped our website and digital app layout which enhanced customization of orders and quick add options. In addition, we added convenience with group ordering, Apple pay and order status. Our Noodles Rewards program, relaunched in 2019 incorporates points and tier-based rewards to further drive customer engagement. We believe there still remains a significant opportunity to enhance our Noodles Rewards program and digital experience for our guests. Additionally, we have reduced friction for off-premise channels through the use of our quick pick-up counter within our locations and through our third-party delivery program. 
•Focusing on our global flavors and menu offerings. We believe that our globally-inspired menu, focused on noodle and pasta dishes, differentiates us from other restaurants. We also believe this global variety, which includes a range of healthy to indulgent dishes that are cooked to order with fresh, high-quality ingredients, remains a competitive strength. Our menu innovation has significant potential to broaden awareness and drive new guests with our healthy noodle alternatives, including zucchini and LEANguini dishes, and continued innovation in our classic noodle dishes. 

•Improving efficiencies and unit-level margins. The increased demand for off-premise and digital sales has accelerated our ability to optimize our staffing model and vendor efficiencies. We are actively enhancing our supply chain and food preparation procedures to reduce inbound ingredient costs and improve labor efficiency through our ongoing Kitchen of the Future Initiative. Since 2018, the Kitchen of the Future Initiative has identified several areas of in-restaurant labor reductions, including upgrading to a sales-based labor model, reducing hours for front of house cashiers, optimizing pre-prepared ingredients and investing in steamer equipment. This ongoing initiative is anticipated to further optimize our restaurant efficiencies by identifying new processes, equipment and technology which we believe will help offset increases in food and wage inflation.
•Improving manager selection, training and development of our teams. Team member retention is a critical component to our success. We have increased our focus on the selection, training and development of our restaurant teams by implementing certain changes to our restaurant compensation program and an expanded benefits program. Our previous investments in extensive training tools and learning management systems have improved overall training execution, improved employee turnover and encouraged career development within our teams. 
Restaurant Portfolio and Franchising
Restaurant Portfolio. As of January 3, 2023, we had 368 company-owned restaurants and 93 franchise restaurants in 31 states. Our restaurants are typically between 2,000 and 2,600 square feet and are located in end-cap, in-line or free-standing locations across a variety of suburban, collegiate and urban markets. We are currently executing a smaller square footage design which largely includes order ahead drive-thru windows as we embed an off-premise focused operating model into new restaurants. We anticipate that this design will better facilitate future expansion and better meet the needs of the changing consumer experience.
Restaurant Development. In 2022, we opened sixteen new company-owned restaurants and three franchised locations. We anticipate approximately 7.5% new unit growth in 2023, and between 7% to 10% during 2024 and beyond, based on our disciplined identification of sites and growing pipeline. We anticipate this unit growth to include a combination of both company and franchise development.
Certain Restaurant Closures. We closed five company-owned restaurants in 2022, most of which were at or approaching the expiration of their leases or in trade areas that are not as well positioned for current consumer trends. We currently do not anticipate a significant number of restaurant closures for the foreseeable future; however, we may from time to time close or relocate certain restaurants, that are at, or near, the expiration of their leases or in trade areas that are not as well positioned for current consumer trends.
Franchising. As of January 3, 2023, we had 93 franchise units in 18 states operated by 11 franchisees. In 2022, our franchisees opened three restaurants and closed one restaurant. We have a total of eight area developers who have signed development agreements providing for the opening of 97 additional restaurants in their respective territories. In January of 2022, we completed the sale of 15 restaurants in California to a new franchise partner (the “Warner Sale”). We expect franchising to be a part of our growth strategy in future years. We look for experienced, well-capitalized franchise partners who are able to leverage their existing infrastructure and local knowledge in a manner that benefits both our franchisees and us. We expect to continue to offer development rights in markets where we do not intend to build company-owned restaurants. We may offer such rights to larger developers who commit to open 10 or more units, or to smaller developers who may commit to open fewer restaurants. We do not currently intend to offer single-unit franchises. We believe the strength and attractiveness of our brand will attract experienced and well-capitalized area developers.
Site Development and Expansion
We consider our site selection and development process critical to our long-term success. We have used a combination of our own internal team and outside real estate consultants to locate, evaluate and negotiate new sites using various criteria. In making site selection decisions, we use several analytical tools designed to uncover the key site, demographic, business, retail, competitive and traffic characteristics that drive successful locations. Once a location has been approved by our executive-level selection committee, we begin a design process to match the characteristics and feel of the location to the trade area.
Restaurant Management and Operations
Friendly Team Members. We believe our genuine, friendly team members separate us from our competitors. We value the individuality of our team members, which we believe results in a management, operations and training philosophy distinct from that of our competitors. We strive to hire team members who share our values, a passion for food, have a competitive spirit and will operate our restaurants in a way that is consistent with our high standards. We seek to hire individuals who will deliver prompt, attentive service by engaging customers at all points during the Noodles brand experience. We empower our team members to enrich the experience of our customers and directly address any concerns that may arise in a manner that contributes to the success of our business.
Restaurant Management and Employees. Each restaurant typically has a general manager, an assistant general manager, multiple shift managers and team members. We cross-train our employees in an effort to create a depth of competency in our critical restaurant functions. To lead our restaurant management teams, we have area managers (each of whom is responsible for between five and 10 restaurants), as well as regional directors (each of whom is responsible for between approximately 50 and 60 restaurants).
Training and Career Development. We believe that our training efforts create a culture of continuous learning and professional growth that allows our team members to continue their career development with us. Within each restaurant, two to four team members are designated to lead the training efforts and ensure a consistent approach to team member development. We produce training materials that encourage individual contributions and participation from our team members while also requiring adherence to certain guidelines and procedures.
Food Preparation and Quality. Our teams use classic professional cooking methods, including sautéing many of our vegetables, in full kitchens resembling those of full-service restaurants. All team members, including our restaurant managers, spend their first several days working solely with food and learning these techniques, and we spend a significant amount of time ensuring that each team member learns how to prepare and cook our food properly.
The majority of our restaurants have exhibition-style kitchens. This design demonstrates our commitment to cooking fresh food in an accessible manner. We provide each customer with individual attention and make every effort to respond to customer suggestions and concerns in a personal and hospitable way.
We require all of our dishes to be cooked to order at food safe temperatures or, in the case of salads, subject to our produce washing protocols, which helps to ensure that the food we serve to our customers is safe. We have designed our food safety and quality assurance programs to maintain high standards for our food and food preparation procedures. Our director of quality assurance oversees comprehensive restaurant and supplier audits based upon the potential food safety risk of each food. We also consider food safety and quality assurance when selecting our distributors and suppliers. Our suppliers are inspected by federal, state and local regulators or other reputable, qualified inspection services, which helps ensure their compliance with all federal food safety and quality guidelines. We regularly inspect our suppliers to ensure that the ingredients we buy conform to our quality standards and that the prices we pay are competitive. We also rely on our own recipes, specifications and protocols to ensure that our food is consistently the best quality that is possible when it is served, including a physical examination of ingredients when they arrive at our restaurants. We train our employees to pay detailed attention to food quality at every stage of the food preparation cycle, and we have developed a daily checklist that our employees use to assess the freshness and quality of food supplies. Finally, we encourage our customers to provide feedback regarding our food quality so that we can identify and resolve problems or concerns as quickly as possible.
Restaurant Marketing
Our strategic marketing efforts seek to drive sales and increase brand loyalty by highlighting our competitive strengths through a variety of channels including digital marketing, social media, public relations, guest engagement and local marketing. We focus on attributes that set us apart including the breadth and customization of our menu and our best-in-class convenience offerings, and ultimately use a data-driven approach to guide our strategy. 
•Our Menu Offering. At the heart of our marketing is our ongoing mission to always nourish and inspire every team member, guest and community we serve. We focus some of our marketing efforts on new menu offerings to broaden our appeal to our customers. For example, during 2022, our new menu offering efforts centered around the launch of 

LEANguini, our proprietary low-carb, high-protein noodle dish. Most of these marketing efforts are focused on prompt consumer action to directly drive traffic and trial. 
•Brand Platform. During 2022, we launched a new brand platform called Uncommon Goodness, under the tagline “we infuse Uncommon Goodness in everything we do.” The focus of the platform is to strengthen our brand awareness, introduce the Noodles brand to new guests and remind existing guests what makes Noodles unique. 
•Loyalty Program. Our Noodles Rewards program grew 12.5% during 2022 to more than 4.5 million members and allows us to connect directly with each guest. The program allows guests to accumulate reward points associated with each purchase that can be redeemed for offers such as free bowls, shareables and delivery. Rewards members are typically the first to learn about new offerings, and in some cases are provided exclusive access to certain menu items. The data acquired from rewards members is used to target and personalize offers and communications. 
•Seamless Digital Experiences. Digital properties inclusive of our website and our app offer guests a differentiated and seamless ordering experience. Our digital experience has been carefully designed to showcase our food. From exploring, selecting and ordering new dishes, to finding the perfect shareable or redeeming rewards points, the digital experience is a critical part of the guest journey. 
•Digital Marketing. We use targeted digital advertising across all markets spanning email, search, display, social, video and other related channels. This helps to increase top of mind awareness with potential guests and drives frequency, trial and guest spend. We leverage zero-party and first-party data to drive effective and efficient advertising spend, ensuring we are improving the return on our investment. In addition, digital advertising provides us with the opportunity to promote specific product categories, highlight convenient off-premise channel offerings, communicate rewards and encourage consumer action, resulting in immediate increases in our customer traffic and long-term customer loyalty. In 2022, we began the rollout of digital menu boards across our locations, which we expect to complete in 2023. Digital menu boards allow us to showcase key menu features, target guest communication, enhance our pricing capabilities and increase flexibility for culinary testing.
Human Capital Management
We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a brand. This is largely attributed to our team members who strive every day to create an environment for our guests where they feel welcomed and cared for. Therefore, one of our strategic priorities is to develop people as a differentiator, including investing in the following areas of focus:
Oversight and Management. We recognize the diversity of our team members, guests and communities, and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our Human Resources department is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation and benefit planning, performance management and talent development. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as team member retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks.
Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters as part of their overall engagement in our Environmental, Social and Governance practices. Our Compensation Committee, with input from members of our management and a third-party compensation consultant who provides benchmarked data, has responsibility for administering and approving annually certain elements of compensation, including our incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans. Management provides input into the design of our incentive compensation programs to ensure that these programs support the Company’s business objectives and strategic priorities. The annual business plan initially established by our management, but approved by our Board, is an important element of our Compensation Committee’s decision-making process for performance measures and goals. 

Total Rewards. We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of our team members with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible team members under our stock incentive programs. Additionally, we provide incentive compensation through annual bonus plans for all eligible team members. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive, targeted and innovative benefits to all eligible team members. This includes comprehensive health, dental and vision insurance coverage, a 401(k) program and paid time off. 
In 2022, we announced the expansion of our already comprehensive team member benefits program called LifeAtNoodles. The new benefits include financial planning services, immigration reimbursement program, GM equity partner program, introduction of Noodles Resource Groups and expansion of our balance bucks program.
•GM Equity Partner Program. Continuity of our General Managers (“GM”) is directly correlated to the positive financial performance of our restaurants. Our new GM Equity Partner Program is designed to reward and motivate our top performers. Twice a year top performing GMs (identified by performance against key financial and operational metrics) are invited into the program and are granted RSUs with a three year cliff vest. We firmly believe that investing in this key talent will drive retention of our leaders. 
•Immigration Reimbursement Program. Many of our team members come from different parts of the world. Remaining eligible to work in the United States can be timely and costly. We provide financial reimbursement to support our team members as they navigate their immigration process.
•Noodles Balance Bucks Program. We offer numerous mental, financial and physical health benefits to our team. In 2022, we expanded on our existing Balance Bucks Program, which allows eligible team members to be reimbursed for fitness and physical health related purchases and expenses. In 2022, this program expanded to support a broader range of eligible expenses and now includes purchases and expenses related to team members mental and financial well-being, along with physical fitness and health. We also expanded eligibility of this program in 2022 so that now all Assistant General Managers and above are eligible for the program. 
•Inclusion & Diversity. At Noodles, we live our core values every day by working towards creating an inclusive and welcoming environment for all. In 2022, we believe we have made much traction in this area. One of the most impactful programs we put in place in 2022 in this space are Noodles’ versions of Employee Resource Groups, called NRGs (“Noodles Resource Groups”). We introduced two different NRGs in 2022 that are led by executive sponsors. One group, THRIVE, supports the BIPOC community and their allies. Our second group is PROUD which supports the LGBTQIA+ community and their allies. These groups are designed to help elevate the voice of these underrepresented populations and increase recruiting and retention efforts. These groups also support Noodles by bringing forward key ideas that can help advance the business and identify additional ways for Noodles to improve its community presence by getting involved in various community organizations and events.
We are continually focused on how we can offer the best workplace in our industry and we are proud of these benefits that honor our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We were named one of America's Favorite Restaurants by Newsweek, and one of the Top 500 Franchises by Franchise Times. Noodles has been recognized by Forbes as one of America's Best Employers for Diversity in 2021 and 2022 and one of America's Best Employers for Women in 2021. Additionally, QSR recently named Noodles one of 2022's Best Brands to Work For, and the Denver Business Journal has called Noodles one of the Best Places to Work for its unique culture focused on Uncommon Goodness and built on the value of "Loving Life," which begins by nourishing and inspiring its communities and every team member and guest who walks through the door. We have also earned the Women in the Lead Certification for our investment in women-empowering initiatives for its female team members and have proudly partnered with the Multicultural Foodservice & Hospitality Alliance to build cultural intelligence within our teams. Finally, we released our first Nourish & Inspire impact report in October of 2021 detailing the progress we have made across four important areas of our business: food, people, planet, and community.
As of January 3, 2023, we had approximately 8,100 employees, including approximately 600 salaried employees and approximately 7,500 hourly employees. None of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.

Suppliers
Maintaining a high degree of quality in our restaurants depends in part on our ability to acquire fresh ingredients and other necessary supplies that meet our specifications from reliable suppliers. We carefully select suppliers based on quality and their understanding of our brand, and we seek to develop mutually beneficial long-term relationships with them. We work closely with our suppliers and use a mix of forward, fixed and formula pricing protocols. In some cases, we have made efforts to increase the number of suppliers for our ingredients, which we believe can help mitigate pricing volatility. We monitor industry news, trade issues, weather, crises and other world events that may affect supply prices.
Seasonality/Quarterly Financial Information
Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters, due to reduced winter and holiday traffic, and higher in the second and third quarters. Other factors also have a seasonal effect on our results. For example, restaurants located near colleges and universities generally do more business during the academic year. Seasonal factors, however, might be moderated or outweighed by other factors that may influence our quarterly results, such as worldwide health pandemics, fluctuations in food or packaging costs, or the timing of menu price increases or promotional activities and other marketing initiatives.
Our quarterly results are also affected by other factors such as the amount and timing of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax rate impacts, impairment charges and non-operating costs, timing of marketing or promotional expenses, the number and timing of new restaurants opened in a quarter, and closure of restaurants. New restaurants typically have higher operating costs following opening because of the expenses associated with their opening and operating inefficiencies in the months immediately following opening. Accordingly, results for a particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. 
Competition
We face competition from the casual dining, quick-service and fast-casual segments of the restaurant industry. These segments are highly competitive with respect to taste, price, food quality and presentation, service, location and the ambiance and condition of each restaurant, among other things. Our competition includes a variety of locally owned restaurants and national and regional chains who offer dine-in, carry-out and delivery services. Many of our competitors have existed longer and have a more established market presence with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we have. Among our competitors are a number of multi-unit, multi-market fast-casual restaurant concepts, some of which are expanding nationally. As we expand, we will face competition from these concepts and new competitors that strive to compete with our market segments. 
We also face competition from firms outside the restaurant industry, such as grocery stores and home meal replacement services, who sell prepared meals for takeout and in some cases, offer delivery service.
Intellectual Property and Trademarks
We own a number of trademarks and service marks registered or pending with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also have certain trademarks registered in certain foreign countries. In addition, we own the internet domain name www.noodles.com. The information on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not part of this report. We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property rights have significant value and are important to the marketing of our brand, and it is our policy to protect and defend vigorously our rights to such intellectual property.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to extensive and varied federal, state and local government regulation, including regulations relating to public and occupational health and safety, sanitation and fire prevention. We operate each of our restaurants in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, an inability to obtain or retain health department or other licenses could adversely affect our operations. Although we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular restaurant or group of restaurants.

In addition, in order to develop and construct restaurants, we need to comply with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. Federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date, but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new restaurants. We are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.
In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws governing similar matters including minimum wages, overtime, workplace safety and other working conditions. Our failure to fully comply with these laws could subject us to potential litigation and liability. We are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations.
We are also subject to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”), which requires health care coverage for many previously uninsured individuals and expands coverage for those already insured. We began offering such benefits in 2015.
We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances (“environmental laws”). These environmental laws can provide for significant fines and penalties for non-compliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such substances. We are not aware of any environmental laws that will materially affect our earnings or competitive position, or result in material capital expenditures relating to our restaurants. However, we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered, interpreted or enforced, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, environmental laws. It is possible that we will become subject to environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Management Information Systems
We use a variety of applications and systems to securely manage the flow of information within each restaurant, and within our central support office infrastructure. All of our restaurants use computerized management information systems, which we believe are scalable to support any future growth plans. We use point-of-sale (“POS”) computers designed specifically for the restaurant industry. Our POS system provides a touch screen interface, a graphical order confirmation display and integrated, high-speed credit card and gift card processing. Our online ordering system allows customers to place orders online or through our mobile app. Orders taken remotely are routed to the point-of-sale system based on the time of customer order pickup. The POS system is used to collect daily transaction data, which generates information about daily sales, product mix and average check that we actively analyze. All products sold and prices at our company-owned restaurants are programmed into the system from our central support office. We also continue to modernize and make investments in our information technology networks and infrastructure, specifically in our physical and technological security measures, to anticipate cyber-attacks and defend against breaches and to provide improved control, security and scalability. Enhancing the security of our financial data, customer information and other personal information is a high priority for us.
Our in-restaurant back office computer system is designed to assist in the management of our restaurants and provide labor and food cost management tools. These tools provide restaurant operations management and our central support office quick access to detailed business data and reduces restaurant managers’ administrative time. The system provides our restaurant managers the ability to submit orders electronically with our distribution network. The system also supplies sales, bank deposit and variance data to our finance department on a daily basis. We use this data to generate daily sales information and weekly consolidated reports regarding sales and other key measures. 

Franchisees use similar point of sale systems and are required to report sales on a daily basis through an online reporting network and submit their restaurant-level financial statements on a quarterly and annual basis. We also offer certain restaurant technology support services to our franchisees.
Financial Information About Segments
We operate as a single accounting segment. Financial information related to our business is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Available Information 
We maintain a website at www.noodles.com, including an investor relations section at investor.noodles.com, on which we routinely post important information, such as webcasts of quarterly earnings calls, and any related materials.
