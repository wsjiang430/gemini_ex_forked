 ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Audacy is a leading, scaled, multi-platform audio content and entertainment company. We are the leading creator of live, original, local, premium audio content in the United States and the nation’s leader in local sports and news radio. We are also one of the country’s leading podcasters and operate a digital marketing solutions business, an events and experiences business, and the Audacy digital audio streaming platform featuring a wide array of broadcast audio, podcasting and exclusive digital content. Through our multi-channel platform, we engage our consumers each month with highly immersive content and experiences from voices and influencers our communities trust. Our robust portfolio of assets and integrated solutions help advertisers take advantage of the burgeoning audio opportunity through targeted reach and conversion, brand amplification and local activation - all at a national scale. 
We are home to more than 40 professional sports teams and dozens of top college athletic programs. As one of the country’s two largest radio broadcasters, we offer local and national advertisers integrated marketing solutions across our broadcast, digital, podcast and event platform, delivering the power of local connection on a national scale. Our nationwide footprint of radio stations includes leading positions concentrated in the top 50 markets in the US. We were organized in 1968 as a Pennsylvania corporation.
Our Digital and Live Events Platforms
We operate digital properties on multiple platforms, including websites, mobile apps, and social media. We expand our reach and engagement with unique digital content and amplify brand impact through social media integration with influential local talent.
Audacy App. We provide streaming services through our Audacy app and website, our integrated digital platform where consumers discover and connect live with premium, curated content powered by over 856 programmed radio stations and their websites, podcasts, audio on-demand, and exclusive content across entertainment, music, news and sports. Harnessing the power of our cumulative audience, this robust platform is delivering strong growth and deep engagement twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.
Podcast Studios. Through our strategic acquisitions of Pineapple, Cadence13 and Podcorn (as defined below), along with the launch in 2022 of our 2400Sports podcast studio and our podcast creation efforts across our footprint of local newsrooms and studios, we are one of the top podcasters in the United States creating, distributing and monetizing premium podcasts to our audiences with more than 40 million monthly listeners across hundreds of premium owned and partner shows.
Our unique leadership position in podcasting leverages our scale across the top 50 markets, our enhanced targeted data capabilities, our top-rated portfolio of spoken word brands, and Cadence13, Pineapple Street and 2400Sport's capabilities as among the industry's leading developers and sellers of original podcast content. 
Podcorn. In March 2021, we completed an acquisition of podcast influencers marketplace, Podcorn Media, Inc. ("Podcorn"). This acquisition expands our product offering for advertisers and builds on our position as one of the country's three largest podcast publishers. Podcorn creates an infrastructure for enabling direct podcaster and advertiser relationships, surfacing the most relevant matches to scale native branded content, driving higher ROI for brands, and enhancing how podcast creators monetize their content. 
Sports Platform. We are the nation's leading collection of sports talk stations covering 25 of the top 50 markets and broadcast partner to over 40 professional sports teams and numerous college athletic programs. In November 2020, we acquired sports data and iGaming affiliate platform QL Gaming Group ("QLGG"), which brings data, analytics and insight-driven content to Audacy's sports broadcast stations, podcasts and our Audacy platform.
AmperWave. In October 2021, we completed an acquisition of WideOrbit's audio streaming and advertising technology business (“WO Streaming”). We operate WO Streaming under the name AmperWave. This acquisition gives us control of our product roadmap to deliver enhanced consumer-facing streaming features for our listeners and ad tech and ad product capabilities to better serve customers and drive new revenue opportunities..
Live Events. We are a leading creator of live, original events, including large-scale concerts, intimate live performances with big artists on small stages. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy focuses on accelerating growth by capitalizing on scale, efficiencies and operating expertise to consistently deliver excellent premium audio content across our radio stations, podcasts, and exclusive digital programming to build and expand our audiences across our various distribution channels including our Audacy digital streaming platform. In addition, we focus on growing revenues by working to enhance our capacity to serve customers compelling opportunities to access our large and targeted audiences and deliver highly effective marketing programs across our various platforms utilizing our emerging toolkit of broadcast radio, network, endorsements, events and experiences, digital audio streaming, podcasting, digital marketing solutions, social media, and more. We also strive to offer a great place to work, where our talented high achievers can grow and thrive
Sources Of Revenue
The primary source of revenue for our radio stations is the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers and national network advertisers who purchase commercials in varying lengths. A growing source of revenue is from station-related digital product suites, which allow for enhanced audience interaction and participation, and integrated digital advertising solutions. A station’s local sales staff generates the majority of its local and regional advertising sales through direct solicitations of local advertising agencies and businesses. We retain a national representation firm to sell to advertisers outside of our local markets.
Our stations are typically classified by their format, such as news, sports, talk, classic rock, urban, adult contemporary, alternative and country, among others. A station’s format enables it to target specific segments of listeners sharing certain demographics. Advertisers and stations use data published by audience measuring services to estimate how many people within particular geographical markets and demographics listen to specific stations. Our geographically and demographically diverse portfolio of radio stations allows us to deliver targeted messages to specific audiences for advertisers on a local, regional and national basis.
A growing source of our revenues are derived from our digital and podcasting operations. The podcast advertising market is growing rapidly and we believe the acquisitions of Cadence13, Pineapple and Podcorn along with the 2022 launch of or 2400Sports studio and locally produced podcast content across our newsrooms and studios in top US markets position us well for sustained success in this space due to the scale of our radio broadcasting platform, and the powerful symbiotic opportunities, driven by our leading position in sports, news, and local personalities. The primary source of revenue for our podcasting operations is the sale of advertising time to regional and national advertisers who purchase commercials in varying lengths. 
Spot Revenues
We sell air-time to advertisers and broadcast commercials at agreed upon dates and times. Our performance obligations are broadcasting advertisements for advertisers at specifically identifiable days and dayparts. The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize is fixed based upon contractually agreed upon rates. We recognize revenue at a point in time when the advertisements are broadcast and the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenues are recorded on a net basis, after the deduction of advertising agency fees by the advertising agencies. 
Digital Revenues
We provide targeted advertising through the sale of streaming and display advertisements on our station streams and digital platforms. Performance obligations include delivery of advertisements over our platforms or delivery of targeted advertisements directly to consumers. We recognize revenue at a point in time when the advertisements are delivered and the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenues are recorded on a net basis, after the deduction of advertising agency fees by the advertising agencies.
We also provide embedded advertisements in our owned and operated podcasts and other on-demand content. Performance obligations include delivery of advertisements. We recognize revenue at a point in time when the advertisements are delivered and the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenues are recorded on a net basis, after the deduction of advertising agency fees by the advertising agencies.
We also operate a premier digital agency business that serves local and national advertisers. Our offerings span all facets of digital advertising, with a suite of products that can fit nearly every advertiser's needs, helping them generate strong returns from their digital campaigns. Advertisers can seamlessly buy across our broadcast platform, our owned digital assets like streaming and podcasting, and our third-party digital offerings like search, social, email and video. 
Through our acquisition of Pineapple, we create podcasts, for which we earn production fees. Performance obligations include the delivery of episodes. These revenues are fixed based upon contractually agreed upon terms. We recognize revenue over the term of the production contract.
Network Revenues
We sell air-time on our Audacy Network. The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize is fixed based upon contractually agreed upon rates. We recognize revenue at a point in time when the advertisements are broadcast and the performance obligations are satisfied. Revenues are recorded on a net basis, after the deduction of advertising agency fees by the advertising agencies. 
Sponsorship and Event Revenues
We sell advertising space at live and local events hosted by us across the country. We also earn revenues from attendee-driven ticket sales and merchandise sales. Performance obligations include the presentation of the advertisers' branding in highly visible areas at the event. These revenues are recognized at a point in time, as the event occurs and the performance obligations are satisfied.
We also sell sponsorships including, but not limited to, naming rights related to our programs or studios. Performance obligations include the mentioning or displaying of the sponsors' name, logo, product information, slogan or neutral descriptions of the sponsors' goods or services in acknowledgement of their support. These revenues are fixed based upon contractually agreed upon terms. We recognize revenue over the length of the sponsorship agreement based upon the fair value of the deliverables included.
Other Revenues
We earn revenues from on-site promotions and endorsements from talent. Performance obligations include the broadcasting of such endorsements at specifically identifiable days and dayparts or at various local events. We recognize revenue at a point in time when the performance obligations are satisfied. 
We earn trade and barter revenue by providing advertising broadcast time in exchange for certain products, supplies, and services. We include the value of such exchanges in both net revenues and station operating expenses. Trade and barter value is based upon management's estimate of the fair value of the products, supplies and services received. We recognize revenue at a point in time when the advertisements are broadcast and the performance obligations are satisfied.
Competition
The radio broadcasting, digital and podcasting industries are highly competitive. We compete for listeners and advertising revenue with other radio stations, podcasters, audio and event companies. Specifically, we compete for audiences and advertising revenues with other media including: digital audio streaming, podcasts, satellite radio, broadcast television, digital, satellite and cable television, newspapers and magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail, yellow pages, wireless media alternatives, cellular phones and other forms of audio entertainment and advertisement. 
We believe our robust portfolio of assets and integrated solutions offer advertisers today's most engaged audiences through targeted reach, brand amplification and local activation at a national scale, which allows us to compete effectively against other broadcast radio operators and other media. 
Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting
Overview. The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing government regulation of, among other things, ownership limitations, program content, advertising content, technical operations and business and employment practices. The ownership, operation and sale of radio stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”).
The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of certain specific FCC regulations and policies. This summary is not a comprehensive listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations, you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and FCC public notices and rulings.
FCC Licenses. The operation of a radio broadcast station requires a license from the FCC. We hold the FCC licenses for our stations in wholly owned subsidiaries. While there are no national radio station ownership caps, FCC rules do limit the number of stations within the same market that a single individual or entity may own or control.
Ownership Rules. The FCC sets limits on the number of radio broadcast stations an entity may permissibly own within a market. Same-market FCC numeric ownership limitations are based: (i) on markets as defined and rated by Nielsen Audio; and (ii) in areas outside of Nielsen Audio markets, on markets as determined by overlap of specified signal contours.
Ownership Attribution. In applying its ownership limitations, the FCC generally considers only “attributable” ownership interests. Attributable interests generally include: (i) equity and debt interests which when combined exceed 33% of a licensee’s or other media entity’s total asset value, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of a station’s total weekly programming or has an attributable interest in any same-market media (television, radio, cable or newspaper), with a higher threshold in the case of investments in certain “eligible entities” acquiring broadcast stations; (ii) a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor, in which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; (iii) any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; and (iv) any position as an officer or director of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent.
Foreign Ownership Rules. The Communications Act prohibits the issuance to, or holding of broadcast licenses by, foreign governments or aliens, non-U.S. citizens, whether individuals or entities, including any interest in a corporation which holds a broadcast license if more than 20% of the licensee’s capital stock is owned or voted by aliens. In addition, the FCC may prohibit any corporation from holding a broadcast license if the corporation is directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens if the FCC finds that the prohibition is in the public interest. The Communications Act gives the FCC discretion to allow greater amounts of alien ownership. The FCC considers investment proposals from international companies or individuals on a case-by-case basis.
License Renewal. Radio station licenses issued by the FCC are ordinarily renewable for an eight-year term. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. All of our licenses have been renewed and are current or we have timely filed license renewal applications. 
The FCC is required to renew a broadcast station’s license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations; and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. If a challenge is filed against a renewal application, and, as a result of an evidentiary hearing, the FCC determines that the licensee has failed to meet certain fundamental requirements and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction, the FCC may deny a license renewal application. In certain instances, the FCC may renew a license application for less than a full eight-year term. Historically, our FCC licenses have generally been renewed for the full term.
Transfer or Assignment of Licenses. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of broadcast licenses or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant such approval, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the existing licensee and the proposed licensee, including: (i) compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties in a given market; (ii) the “character” of the proposed licensee; and (iii) compliance with the Communications Act’s limitations on alien ownership as well as general compliance with FCC regulations and policies.
Programming and Operation. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest.” A licensee is required to present programming that is responsive to issues in the station’s community of license and to maintain records demonstrating this responsiveness. The FCC regulates, among other things, political advertising; sponsorship identification; the advertisement of contests and lotteries; the conduct of station-run contests; obscene, indecent and profane broadcasts; certain employment practices; and certain technical operation requirements, including limits on human exposure to radio-frequency radiation. The FCC considers complaints from listeners concerning a station’s public-service programming, employment practices, or other operational issues when processing a renewal application filed by a station, but the FCC may consider complaints at any time and may impose fines or take other action for violations of the FCC’s rules separate from its action on a renewal application.
FCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time as well as the broadcast, between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., of material it considers “indecent” or “profane”. The FCC has historically enforced licensee compliance in this area through the assessment of monetary forfeitures. Such forfeitures may include: (i) imposition of the maximum 
authorized fine for egregious cases ($479,945 for a single violation, up to a maximum of $4,430,255 for a continuing violation); and (ii) imposition of fines on a per utterance basis instead of a single fine for an entire program. There may be indecency complaints that have been submitted to the FCC of which we have not yet been notified.
Enforcement Authority. The FCC has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the Communications Act, including the imposition of monetary fines, the issuance of short-term licenses, the imposition of a condition on the renewal of a license, the denial of authority to acquire new stations, and the revocation of operating authority. The maximum fine for a single violation of the FCC’s rules (other than the rules regarding indecency and profanity) is $59,316.
Proposed and Recent Changes. Congress, the FCC and other federal agencies are considering or may in the future consider and adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could: (i) affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership and profitability of our radio stations; (ii) result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations; or (iii) affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or to finance those acquisitions.
Federal Antitrust Laws. The federal agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), may investigate certain acquisitions. For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and to observe specified waiting-period requirements before consummating the acquisition. 
HD Radio
AM and FM radio stations may use the FCC selected In-Band On-Channel (“IBOC”) as the exclusive technology for terrestrial digital operations. IBOC is known as “HD Radio.” We currently use HD Radio digital technology on most of our FM stations. The advantages of digital audio broadcasting over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality, the availability of additional channels and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,539 full-time employees and 1,430 part-time employees. With respect to certain of our stations in our Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Hartford, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and St. Louis markets, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ("SAG-AFTRA"). With respect to certain of our stations in our Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City markets, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with the Writers Guild of America East ("WGAE") and/or Writers Guild of America West ("WGAW"). Our Pineapple Street Studios also recently recognized the WGAE as representing certain employees of that division and is in the process of negotiating an initial contract. With respect to certain of our stations in our Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and St. Louis markets, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers ("IBEW"). Finally, the Digital and Multimedia Workers Union recently was certified to represent certain employees in our San Francisco market. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
We believe that our future success depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and an employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. 
We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI") Council, comprised of representatives from across our Company, supports our current DEI initiatives, and is responsible for championship and communicating future DEI initiatives. Through our year-long fellowship experiences, which include on-the-job learning and growth opportunities, we welcome recent college graduates from underrepresented groups and underserved communities, as well as others who demonstrate the talent and desire to pursue a career in audio to fill key openings across our organization. The fellowship program is a structured one-year job assignment complete with coaching, mentoring and career development experiences to foster a rapid learning and growth environment among the cohort, while increasing the successful integration of early career talent within our team. 
Corporate Governance
Code Of Business Conduct And Ethics. We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to each of our employees, including our principal executive officers and senior members of our finance department. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can be found on the “Investors” sub-page of our website located at www.audacyinc.com/investors/corporate-governance.
Board Committee Charters. Each of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee has a committee charter as required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). These committee charters can be found on the “Investors” sub-page of our website located at www.audacyinc.com/investors/corporate-governance.
Corporate Governance Guidelines. NYSE rules require our Board of Directors (the “Board”) to establish certain Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines can be found on the “Investors” sub-page of our website located at www.audacyinc.com/investors/corporate-governance.
Environmental Compliance
As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business.
Seasonality
Seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures. Typically, revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year. Due to this seasonality and certain other factors, the results of interim periods may not necessarily be indicative of results for the full year. In additions, our operations are impacted by political cycles and generally experience higher revenues in congressional and presidential election years. This cyclicity may affect comparability between years.
