ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
General
We were formed on March 13, 2018, as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware and we converted into a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on June 18, 2019. We are a specialty finance company organized to maximize the total return to our shareholders primarily in the form of current income achieved through primarily investing in senior secured loans to private equity-owned U.S. middle market companies. Effective June 1, 2020, we changed our name from “Nuveen Churchill BDC, Inc.” to “Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp.”
We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “1940 Act”). In addition, we have elected, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Code”). 
Immediately prior to our election to be regulated as a BDC, Nuveen Churchill BDC SPV I LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“SPV I”), merged with with Churchill Middle Market CLO V Ltd. (the “Predecessor Entity”), with SPV I as the surviving entity in the merger ("Merger"). SPV I is a Delaware limited liability company that was formed on November 13, 2019. SPV I had no assets or operations prior to completion of the Merger and, as a result, the historical books and records of the Predecessor Entity became the books and records of SPV I, the surviving entity in the Merger. The Predecessor Entity was a Cayman exempt limited company and was formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands on November 14, 2017 and commenced operations on January 12, 2018. The Predecessor Entity and SPV I were entities under common control prior to the Merger. On May 20, 2022, SPV I completed a term debt securitization and, in connection therewith, changed its name to Churchill NCDLC CLO-I, LLC (“CLO-I”). CLO-I is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and is consolidated in our consolidated financial statements commencing from the date of its formation. 
Nuveen Churchill BDC SPV II, LLC (“SPV II”) and Nuveen Churchill BDC SPV III, LLC ("SPV III"), both Delaware limited liability companies, were formed on March 19, 2020 and commenced operations on September 21, 2020, the date of their first investment transaction. SPV II and SPV III primarily invest in first-lien senior secured debt and unitranche loans (other than last-out positions in unitranche loans). SPV II and SPV III are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company and are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements commencing from the date of their formation.
Our investment objective is to provide investors with attractive risk-adjusted returns mainly through current income by primarily investing in senior secured loans to private equity-owned U.S. middle market companies. Our portfolio primarily consists of first-lien senior secured debt and unitranche loans (other than last-out positions in unitranche loans) (collectively “Senior Loans”). We also opportunistically invest in junior capital opportunities (second-lien loans, subordinated debt, last-out positions in unitranche loans and equity co-investments, and similar equity-related securities) (collectively “Junior Capital Investments”). 
Each of the Advisers is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the state of Delaware, is an investment adviser registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and are controlled by Nuveen, LLC (“Nuveen”). Nuveen is the investment management arm of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (“TIAA”), a life insurance company founded in 1918 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the companion organization of College Retirement Equities Fund. Nuveen markets a wide range of specialized investment solutions that provide investors access to the capabilities of Nuveen’s investment management affiliates.
The Investment Adviser — Nuveen Churchill Advisors LLC 
Nuveen Churchill Advisors LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, serves as the investment adviser to the Company pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the "Investment Advisory Agreement"). The Adviser is responsible for the overall management of the Company’s activities pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. 
The Adviser has delegated substantially all of its day-to-day portfolio-management obligations as set forth in the Investment Advisory Agreement to Churchill pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement, which was originally entered into on December 31, 2019 and which, with the approval of the board of directors of the Company (the "Board"), including a majority of our independent directors, was amended and restated on December 11, 2020, October 7, 2021 and March 8, 2022 (as amended and restated, the "Sub-Advisory Agreement” and, together with the Investment Advisory Agreement, the “Advisory Agreements”). The Adviser has general oversight over the investment process on behalf of the Company and manages the capital structure of the Company, including, but not limited to, asset and liability management. The Adviser also has ultimate responsibility for the Company’s performance under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement.
The Investment Sub-Adviser — Churchill Asset Management LLC
Churchill serves as a sub-adviser to the Company pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement. In addition to serving as a sub-adviser to the Company, Churchill manages other middle-market investment strategies for affiliated entities such as TIAA, its ultimate parent company, as well as for third-party institutional investors, private funds, collateralized loan obligation vehicles ("CLOs") and separate accounts, Nuveen Churchill Private Capital Income Fund, a BDC, and NC SLF Inc., a closed-end fund registered under the 1940 Act.
As of December 31, 2022, Churchill manages (directly or as a sub-adviser) $45.5 billion of committed capital in BDCs, a registered closed-end fund, separate accounts, CLOs, and private funds investing in private middle-market leveraged loans, subordinated debt, equity related securities, private equity, limited partner commitments, and related strategies. The investment advice that Churchill provides through its team of investment professionals dedicated to Senior Loan investment opportunities (the “Senior Loan Investment Team”) is limited primarily to investments in first-lien secured and unitranche loans made principally to private U.S. middle market companies whose typical profile is consistent with below-investment grade debt ratings categories and that are, in most cases, controlled by private equity investment firms. As of December 31, 2022, the Senior Loan Investment Team manages $23.0 billion of committed capital. The investment advice that Churchill provides through teams of investment professionals dedicated to Junior Capital investment opportunities (the “Junior Capital Investment Team” and, together with the Senior Loan Investment Team, the “Investment Teams”) is limited primarily to investments in private equity, equity co-investments and similar equity-related securities, subordinated debt and second-lien loans, in each case made principally in respect of the U.S. middle market. As of December 31, 2022, the Junior Capital Investment Team manages $22.5 billion of committed capital. 
Churchill provides investment advisory and management services to the Company. Under the terms of the Sub-Advisory Agreement, Churchill: (i) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of investments (including performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies); (ii) closes and monitors investments; and (iii) determines the securities and other assets to be purchased, retained or sold. The Adviser and Churchill have entered into the Sub-Advisory Agreement, which has been approved by the Board, and the terms of which provide Churchill with broad delegated authority to oversee the Company’s portfolio.
Joint Investment Committee
All investment decisions for the Company require the unanimous approval of the members of a joint investment committee (the “Joint Investment Committee”) comprised of senior investment personnel of both Investment Teams. The members of the Joint Investment Committee are Ken Kencel, Jason Strife and Randy Schwimmer. The Joint Investment Committee is also advised by the investment committees of the Senior Loan Investment Team (the “Senior Loan Investment Committee”) and the Junior Capital Investment Team (the “Junior Capital Investment Committee”), respectively. The Senior Loan Investment Committee is currently comprised of Ken Kencel, Randy Schwimmer, Shai Vichness, Chris Cox and Mat Linett. The Junior Capital Investment Committee is currently comprised of Ken Kencel, Jason Strife, Derek Fricke, Anne Philpott, and Nicholas Lawler.
Investment Advisory Agreement
The Adviser is responsible for the overall management of the Company’s activities pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Adviser has delegated substantially all of its day-to-day portfolio-management obligations as set forth in the Investment Advisory Agreement to Churchill pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Adviser has general oversight over the investment process on behalf of the Company. The Adviser also has ultimate responsibility for the Company’s performance under the terms of the Advisory Agreement. 
Base Management Fee
The Company pays a management fee (the “Management Fee”) to the Adviser. The Management Fee is payable quarterly in arrears. Prior to any listing of shares on a national securities exchange (the “Exchange Listing”), or any listing of its securities on any other public trading market, the Management Fee will be calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of average total assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents and undrawn capital commitments and including assets financed using leverage (“Average Total Assets”), at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For purposes of this calculation, cash and cash equivalents include any temporary investments in cash-equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality investment grade debt investments that mature in 12 months or less from the date of investment. Following an Exchange Listing, the Management Fee will be calculated at an annual rate of 1.25% of Average Total Assets.
The Adviser retains 32.5% of the Management Fee. The remaining amount will be paid by the Adviser to Churchill as compensation for services provided by Churchill pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement. 
Incentive Fee
Prior to an Exchange Listing, or any listing of its securities on any other public trading market, the Company will pay no incentive fee to the Adviser. 
Following an Exchange Listing, the Company will pay an incentive fee to the Adviser that will consist of two parts. The first part will be calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the preceding quarter. Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the Management Fee, any expenses payable under the administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”) with Nuveen Churchill Administration LLC, our administrator (the “Administrator”), and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred shares, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income will include, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with payment-in-kind ("PIK") interest, preferred shares with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. The Adviser is not under any obligation to reimburse the Company for any part of the incentive fee it received that was based on accrued interest that the Company never receives.
Pre-incentive fee net investment income will not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital gains or losses. If any distributions from portfolio companies are characterized as a return of capital, such returns of capital would affect the capital gains incentive fee to the extent a gain or loss is realized. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter in which it incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if it has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses.
Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed “hurdle rate” of 1.50% per quarter (6% annually). If market interest rates rise, the Company may be able to invest in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for the Adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income.
Following an Exchange Listing, the Company will pay the Adviser with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
•no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.50% (6% annually);
•100% of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 1.76% in any calendar quarter following an Exchange Listing. The Company refers to this portion of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income as the “catch-up” provision. Following an Exchange Listing, the catch-up is meant to provide the Adviser with 15% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 1.76% in any calendar quarter; and
•15% of the amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.76% in any calendar quarter following an Exchange Listing.
The following is a graphical representation of the quarterly calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee payable following an Exchange Listing. 
These calculations will be appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter.
Following an Exchange Listing, the second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that will be determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 15.0% of the Company’s realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year following an Exchange Listing. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Adviser, the Company will calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in the Company’s portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the amortized cost of such investment. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the amortized cost of such investment since inception. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable calculation date and the amortized cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that will serve as the basis for the calculation of the capital gains incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to our portfolio of investments. If this number is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year equals 15.0% of such amount, as applicable, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in respect of the Company’s portfolio in all prior years following an Exchange Listing.
The Adviser will retain 32.5% of the incentive fee. The remaining amount will be paid by the Adviser to Churchill as compensation for services provided by Churchill pursuant to the Sub-Advisory Agreement.
Expense Support Agreement
The Company entered into an expense support and conditional reimbursement agreement (the “Expense Support Agreement”) with the Adviser. The Adviser may pay certain expenses of the Company, provided that no portion of the payment will be used to pay any interest expense of the Company (each, an “Expense Payment”). Such Expense Payment will be made in any combination of cash or other immediately available funds no later than forty-five days after a written commitment from the Adviser to pay such expense, and/or by an offset against amounts due from the Company to the Adviser or its affiliates. For more information on the Expense Support Agreement see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Employees
We do not have any internal employees. We depend on the investment expertise, skill and network of business contacts of the senior investment professionals of Churchill, who evaluate, negotiate, structure, execute, monitor and service our investments in accordance with the terms of the Sub-Advisory Agreement.
Competitive Advantages
Churchill believes that the foundations of its competitive advantage are its long-standing market presence, ability to invest in size, strong relationships with private equity firms, sourcing capabilities, and ability to compete on factors other than pricing. Churchill believes that it has built a reputation of professionalism and collaboration that positions it to be a preferred capital provider for private equity sponsors’ capital needs. Churchill believes that this reputation in the marketplace is built upon several factors: strong relationships with private equity firms combined with meaningful private equity fund investments; a robust origination and underwriting capability that offers creative and flexible capital solutions; an experienced and deep management team with substantial middle market finance experience; the benefits of alignment with Nuveen and TIAA, its ultimate parent company and largest client.
•Strong relationships with private equity firms combined with meaningful private equity fund investments
The Senior Loan Investment Team is led by the members of the Senior Loan Investment Committee, who average over 27 years of middle market lending experience. A majority of the Senior Loan Investment Committee have worked together for more than 15 years, focusing exclusively on originating, underwriting and monitoring middle market senior loans. During this time, the team has developed deep relationships with hundreds of private equity sponsors and has become a preferred partner to them. Dedicated origination professionals source deal flow from these long-established sources, allowing Churchill to review upwards of 1,000 Senior Loan opportunities per year. The Senior Loan Investment Team’s partnership approach and strong value proposition to private equity firms, as one of a handful of middle market lenders with the ability to commit up to $500 million per transaction, ensure that Churchill sees a wide range of Senior Loan transactions in the market and can be highly selective with regards to which borrowers it ultimately decides to provide capital.
The Junior Capital Investment Team is led by the members of the Junior Capital Investment Committee. This team, acting on behalf of TIAA, has been an active private equity fund investor since 1998, with what Churchill believes is a blue-chip reputation as a limited partner. Since 2011, the Junior Capital Investment Team has committed over $10 billion of limited partnership commitments with over 125 core private equity firms, with advisory board representation in the majority of relationships. (See sections below entitled “—Investment Process Overview” for more information). Churchill believes that the Junior Capital Investment Team’s advisory board representation sets it apart from smaller investors who do not participate in a meaningful way and places it in an attractive position to generate deal flow. 
Churchill has existing relationships with over 400 middle market private equity funds and significant advisory board representation, and has been involved in significant financial activity with (including in some cases investing as a limited partner or similar equity holder of) over 270 of the most active middle market private equity firms in the United States. TIAA and Nuveen have been investors in the private debt and equity markets for over 40 years and, as of December 31, 2022, Churchill and its private capital affiliates held a portfolio of approximately $89 billion in assets that are broadly diversified by industry and region.
•Creative and flexible capital solutions
Because all transactions are unique and require different capital solutions, Churchill’s ability to offer a variety of capital solutions is both differentiated in the market and valued by sponsors. For example, the Senior Loan Investment Team has the ability to pivot between traditional first-lien senior secured loans and unitranche loans, while the Junior Capital Investment Team has the ability to pivot between junior secured or unsecured debt instruments, and also can structure investments in other forms, such as PIK securities and other instruments that may be similar to preferred equity or equity-like in nature. Both Investment Teams can also offer borrowers delayed draw term loans, further enhancing flexibility. Often, capital requirements change over the course of a transaction. Having the latitude to pivot across investment solutions without compromising the objective of superior risk-adjusted returns has enabled Churchill and its affiliates to build market share over time.
•Robust origination and underwriting platform
Churchill has developed a robust investment process and benefits from a team of professionals that have extensive experience in structuring investments and constructing middle-market loan and junior capital portfolios (See section below entitled “—Investment Process Overview” for more information). For instance, the members of Churchill’s Senior Loan Investment Committee have on average more than 27 years of industry experience and have focused expertise in originating, underwriting, and monitoring middle market Senior Loan investments. In addition, many of the senior members of the Investment Teams have held senior management and other positions at a number of leading middle market firms and have existing relationships with many of the active participants in the middle market. As a result, we expect that the Company will continue to be well positioned to take advantage of the demand for capital in the middle market, particularly from private equity sponsored companies, a market segment where Churchill has years of investing experience.
In addition, on the basis of the relationships and partnerships that Churchill has established over the years, Churchill believes that it will be able to provide the Company with a large and diverse pipeline of middle market investment opportunities, thereby allowing it to be highly selective and to maintain underwriting standards. Using a disciplined approach, the Investment Teams will seek to minimize credit losses through comprehensive due diligence of portfolio company fundamentals, terms and conditions and covenant packages. Similarly, following each middle market investment, it implements a regimented credit monitoring system that involves daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly reviews and analysis by the investment professionals, which it believes may enable it to identify problems before it faces difficult liquidity constraints.
•Experienced and deep management
Churchill is led by industry veterans who bring an average of more than 27 years’ experience in middle market investing. Senior management and the Investment Teams have a long history of working together focused exclusively on originating, underwriting, and monitoring middle market investments. The predecessor company managed by Churchill’s senior management team, Churchill Financial, LLC (“Churchill Financial”), was founded in 2006 by current senior management team members Kenneth Kencel, Randy Schwimmer and Christopher Cox (the “Churchill Financial Founders”). The Churchill Financial Founders have together unanimously approved all of the approximately 800 loans made by Churchill Financial and Churchill since 2006. This core management team has been strengthened with the additions of David Heilbrunn, an original Churchill Financial team member, as Head of Product Development and Capital Raising in 2016, Shai Vichness as Chief Financial Officer in 2018 (solidifying the significant role he had in launching Churchill as a part of TIAA’s asset management division (now doing business as Nuveen) in 2015); and Mathew Linett, a long-time senior investment professional of Churchill Financial and Churchill (who now serves as Co-Head of Senior Lending alongside Randy Schwimmer). The Churchill Financial Founders, together with Messrs. Vichness and Linett, now comprise the Senior Loan Investment Committee. 
Additionally, in January 2020, Nuveen’s Private Equity and Junior Capital team became part of Churchill, combining Nuveen’s middle market private-capital capabilities in one team to achieve increased collaboration and scale and a unified brand in connection with our activities in the middle market private equity space. As a result of this combination, Churchill provides investors with a focused strategy for capitalizing on opportunities in the middle market, extensive market knowledge and a differentiated platform. The team includes over 140 professionals in New York, Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas investing $11 billion annually and overseeing nearly $46 billion in committed capital across multiple investment vehicles and limited partner commitments. In connection with this combination, Jason Strife joined the Churchill Financial Founders and Messrs. Heilbrunn, Vichness and Linett as part of the Churchill Management Team. The Junior Capital Investment Team brings rich experience in middle market private equity, mezzanine lending, investment banking, and capital markets roles, with several team members having experience investing across the entire balance sheet.
•Benefits of alignment with Nuveen and TIAA
Churchill benefits substantially from the scale and resources of its ultimate parent company, Nuveen, and Nuveen’s parent company, TIAA. Nuveen is a $1.1 trillion asset manager with approximately $89 billion of assets invested in private capital, in each case as of December 31, 2022. Churchill leverages experience and functionality across Nuveen’s platform, allowing it to focus on its middle market investment expertise. Additionally, Churchill invests in Senior Loans on behalf of TIAA’s general account side-by-side with third party investors. The Junior Capital Investment Team also invests on behalf of TIAA’s general account, with TIAA constituting a majority of its invested capital. This alignment ensures that Churchill consistently thinks and acts like a long-term investor in the asset class.
Investment Strategy
We primarily target loans to U.S.-based middle market companies that require capital for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, and refinancings, with a focus on companies controlled by private equity investment firms. In addition, we may also make investments in non-private equity owned public or private companies of various sizes. We seek to partner with strong management teams executing long-term growth strategies. Target Portfolio Companies will typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics:
•annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $10 million - $100 million, adjusted by certain add-backs per investment, with a focus on adjusted EBITDA of $10 million - $50 million; 
•significant cash equity capitalization supported by a private equity sponsor;
•sustainable leading positions in their respective markets;
•scalable revenues and operating cash flow;
•experienced management teams with successful track records and the ability to successfully operate in a leveraged environment and to adapt to challenging economic or business conditions;
•strong recurring revenue or “re-occurring” revenue, with good visibility of backlog and revenue;
•stable, predictable cash flows with low technology and market risks;
•diversified product offering and customer base;
•low capital expenditure requirements;
•a North American base of operations;
•strong customer relationships;
•products, services or distribution channels having distinctive competitive advantages; and
•defensible niche strategy or other barriers to entry.
While Churchill believes that the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in prospective Portfolio Companies, not all of these criteria necessarily will be met by each prospective portfolio company. In addition, subject to its Charter and Bylaws, the Company may change its investment objective and/or investment criteria over time without notice to or consent from shareholders.

Investment Process Overview
Churchill views the investment process employed on behalf of the Company as consisting of four distinct phases described below:
Origination. Each Investment Team will source middle market investment opportunities through the investment team’s network of relationships with private equity firms and other middle market lenders. Each Investment Team believes that the strength and breadth of its relationships with numerous middle market private equity funds and overall deal sourcing capabilities should enable them to maximize deal flow, support a highly selective investment process, and afford the Company the opportunity to establish favorable portfolio diversification.
Investment Evaluation. Each Investment Team intends to utilize a systematic, consistent approach to credit and portfolio company evaluation, with a particular focus on an acceptable level of debt repayment and deleveraging as well as accretive growth and exit assumptions under a “base case” set of projections (the “Base Case”); this Base Case generally reflects a more conservative estimate than the set of projections provided by a prospective portfolio company, which the Investment Teams refer to as the “Management Case,” and that of the private equity sponsor purchasing/financing the portfolio company, as applicable. The key criteria that each Investment Team evaluates includes (i) strong and resilient underlying business fundamentals, (ii) a substantial equity cushion in the form of capital ranking junior in right of payment to the Company’s investment and (iii) a conclusion that the overall Base Case and in most cases a “Downside Case” allows for adequate debt repayment and deleveraging. In evaluating a particular investment opportunity, each Investment Team will put more emphasis on credit considerations (such as (i) debt repayment and deleveraging under a Base Case set of projections, (ii) the ability of the company to maintain a modest liquidity cushion under a Base Case set of projections, and (iii) the ability of the portfolio company to service its fixed charge obligations under a Base Case set of projections) than on profit potential and loan pricing (among other considerations both quantitative and qualitative). Each Investment Team’s due diligence process for middle market credits will typically entail:
•a thorough review of historical and pro forma financial information (including both performance metrics and proposed capital structure and growth prospects);
•meetings and discussions with management and financial sponsors and their advisors;
•a review of loan documents and material contracts impactful to the operation and profitability of the business in question;
•third-party “quality of earnings” accounting due diligence;
•when appropriate, background checks on key management and/or sponsors;
•third-party research relating to the company’s business, industry, markets, products and services, customers, competitors and regulatory exposure/treatment;
•the commission of third-party analyses when appropriate;
•sensitivity of Management Case and “sponsor case” projections; and
•various comprehensive cash flow analyses and sensitivities.
Each Investment Team’s deal screening, underwriting, approval and closing processes are substantially similar. The following chart summarizes the investment process of the Investment Teams:

• Assess each potential financing opportunity based on defined screening criteria, or “credit box”, with a commitment to provide initial feedback in a timely manner• Evaluate worthwhile transactions through staged “Early Read” or “Matrix” process which employs proprietary screening and underwriting templates• Selected transactions clear the “Early Read” or “Matrix” process and enter due diligence | • Understand sponsor investment thesis and risk considerations• Assess qualitative factors, e.g., management meetings and site visit• Evaluate industry diligence to determine market position and competitive advantage• Review quarterly earnings, industry reports, and consultant reports• Produce financial models including management projections, proprietary base case projections, and break-even analysis | • Prepare Investment Approval Memorandum for review and approval by the applicable Investment Committee and by the Joint Investment Committee of the Company• Review and negotiate transaction documents• Closing Memo documents any changes from approval or provides results of any additional post-approval due diligence• Closing Memo required for funding 

Execution. In executing transactions, each Investment Team will apply what it believes is a thorough, consistent approach to credit evaluation, and maintain discipline with respect to credit, pricing and structure to ensure the ultimate success of the financing. Upon completion of due diligence, the investment professionals working on a proposed Portfolio Investment will deliver a memorandum to the relevant Investment Committee(s). Once an investment has been approved by a unanimous vote of such Investment Committee, the memorandum will be delivered to the Joint Investment Committee of the Company. Once an investment has been approved by a unanimous vote of the Joint Investment Committee, it will move through a series of steps, including an in-depth review of documentation by deal teams, negotiation of final documentation, including resolution of business points and the execution of original documents held in escrow. Upon completion of final documentation, a Portfolio Investment is funded after execution of a final closing memorandum.
Monitoring. The Investment Teams view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of the investment process and further consider regular dialogue with company management and sponsors as well as detailed, internally generated monitoring reports to be critical to monitoring performance. The Investment Teams will implement a monitoring template designed to reasonably ensure compliance with these standards. This template will be used as a tool by the Investment Teams to assess investment performance relative to plan.
As part of the monitoring process, the Senior Loan Investment Team has developed risk policies pursuant to which it will regularly assess the risk profile of each of the Company’s Senior Loan investments, and in a similar manner the Junior Capital Investment Team will regularly assess the risk profile for each of the Company’s Junior Capital Investments. The Investment Teams will rate each investment based on our “Internal Risk Ratings”. For more information on the Internal Risk Ratings of our portfolio, see Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Portfolio and Investment Activity.”
The Investment Teams monitor and, when appropriate, change the investment ratings assigned to each investment in the Company’s portfolio. Each Investment Team reviews the investment ratings in connection with monthly and quarterly portfolio reviews. In addition, the Investment Teams employ what they believe is a proactive monitoring approach as illustrated in the chart below:

Daily/ weekly | Monthly | Quarterly | Ongoing 
• Weekly Joint Investment Team pipeline meeting• Investment Team meeting as required• Review news stories on borrowers/industries and market data via news wires and email alerts• Assess potential covenant defaults• Upgrades/downgrades of internal risk ratings evaluated by deal teams and senior management as information is learned | • Monthly meetings to discuss Management Notice and Watchlist Investments• Evaluate internal risk rating• Credit Surveillance Reports and/or Portfolio Review Templates updated monthly or quarterly following review of financials• Conduct analysis of company results, industry trends, key ratios, and liquidity | • Senior management review of portfolio level metrics and trends• Deals covered in portfolio review depend on internal risk rating with downgraded Senior Loan investments and all Junior Capital Investments reviewed each quarter• Review quarterly financials and compliance certificates• Complete portfolio valuations• Compare financials to prior year, budget, and the Base Case• Evaluate cushion to breakeven cash flow and covenant default levels• Review and confirmation of internal risk rating | • Amendments and waivers negotiated, approved, documented, and closed by deal team• Conduct calls with agent, sponsor, and borrower as needed• Junior Capital Investment Team attends advisory board meetings to the extent they have observation rights• Monitor ESG risks, concerns and opportunities 

Environmental, Social and Governance Policies 
Churchill has established an environmental, social and governance ("ESG") policy for its investment program. Churchill is focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns to its clients, including the Company, while upholding the highest ethical standards, including certain ESG factors, throughout its origination, underwriting and portfolio management processes. Churchill's ESG policy requires that it evaluate ESG-related risks that have the potential to damage a company’s operations and reputation, and perform an analysis of the issuer’s operating history to determine whether such risks are managed to minimize defaults that could give rise to investment losses. Pursuant to the ESG policy, Churchill’s investment teams apply a set of criteria against each investment opportunity through the use of an ESG rating template, the output of which is included in the materials presented to and reviewed by the applicable investment committee underwriting the investment opportunity. The ESG rating template used by Churchill requires an assessment of the materiality of ESG-related risks, review of ‘high-risk’ business activities that may violate applicable underwriting standards, and a management assessment. Using a proprietary ESG methodology, the template rates individual issuers based on its perceived management of ESG risk relative to peers. Post-investment, the ESG policy requires the relevant investment teams to conduct reviews with company management to discuss any ESG-related issues that have arisen. Any such issues are discussed and considered by the Churchill investment teams during periodic portfolio review meetings in order to perform an ongoing risk assessment.
Churchill’s ESG policy is updated as needed to reflect changing practices and industry standards. The consideration of ESG factors as part of Churchill’s underwriting and portfolio management process, however, does not mean that the Company will pursue a specific ESG investment strategy or that a portfolio company will be selected solely on the basis of ESG factors. Churchill may make investment decisions for the Company other than on the basis of ESG considerations. 
Competition
The Company’s primary competitors in acquiring credit investments in middle market companies include other BDCs, public and private funds, CLOs, commercial and investment banks, other middle market asset managers and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of the Company’s potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than those available to the Company. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than those of the Company, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than those established by the Investment Teams. There cannot be any assurance that the competitive pressures faced by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.
Emerging Growth Company
We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and we are eligible to take advantage of certain specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”). We expect to remain an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”) or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues equals or exceeds $1.07 billion, (ii) December 31 of the fiscal year that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the preceding three-year period. In addition, we will take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
The Private Offering
Pursuant to a private offering of our shares of common stock (the "Private Offering"), we are offering shares of our common stock to “accredited investors” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. There is no limit on the number of shares or the amount of capital raised in connection with the Private Offering. Each investor will make a capital commitment to purchase shares of our common stock pursuant to a subscription agreement entered into with us. At each closing in the Private Offering, investors will be required to purchase additional shares up to the amount of their respective unfunded capital commitments. The initial closing of the Private Offering was held on March 13, 2020 (the “Initial Closing”). On September 1, 2021 our board of directors (the "Board") determined to extend the fundraising period from 18 months to 24 months after the Initial Closing. As a result of the foregoing, we extended the period during which we may hold Subsequent Closings from September 13, 2021 to March 13, 2022 (the “Fundraising Period”). On March 8, 2022, our Board determined to conduct a follow-on private offering of our shares of common stock following the end of the Fundraising Period, which ended on March 13, 2022 (the “Follow-on Offering”). We held our final closing of the Follow-on Offering on June 15, 2022. If we are unable to list our shares on a national securities exchange (an "Exchange Listing") or effectuate another permissible liquidity event (as described in our offering documents) within five years of the Initial Closing, subject to up to two one-year extensions at the discretion of the Board, then we will use its best efforts to wind down and/or liquidate and dissolve.
Potential Liquidity Options
Subject to approval by the Board, the Company may seek an Exchange Listing and may complete an IPO in connection with such Exchange Listing. If the Company is unable to complete an Exchange Listing within five years of the Initial Closing, subject to up to two one-year extensions in the discretion of the Board, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to wind down or liquidate pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Charter and Bylaws.
Regulation as a Business Development Company
The following discussion is a general summary of the material prohibitions and descriptions governing BDCs generally. It does not purport to be a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs.
Qualifying Assets. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as “qualifying assets,” unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to the Company’s business are any of the following:
(1)Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which:
(a)is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States;
(b)is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and
(c)satisfies any of the following:
(i)does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange;
(ii)has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million;
(iii)is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or
(iv)is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2 million; 
(2)Securities of any eligible portfolio company controlled by the Company;
(3)Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements;
(4)Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and the Company already owns 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company;
(5)Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities; or
(6)Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment.
In addition, a BDC must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2) or (3) above.
Significant Managerial Assistance. A BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above. A BDC must also offer to make available to the issuer of the qualifying assets significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through monitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising a portfolio company’s officers or other organizational or financial guidance. The Administrator or its affiliate provides such services on our behalf to portfolio companies that accept our offer of managerial assistance.
Temporary Investments. Pending investment in other types of qualifying assets, as described above, the Company’s investments can consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which are referred to herein, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of the Company’s assets would be qualifying assets.
Issuance of Warrants, Options or Rights. Under the 1940 Act, a BDC is subject to restrictions on the issuance, terms and amount of warrants, options or rights to purchase shares of stock that it may have outstanding at any time. In particular, the amount of shares that would result from the conversion or exercise of all outstanding warrants, options or rights to purchase shares cannot exceed 25% of the BDC’s total outstanding shares.
Senior Securities; Asset Coverage Ratio. The Company is generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our shares if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 150% (i.e., we can borrow $2 for every $1 of equity), if certain requirements are met. In connection with the organization of the Company, the Board and TIAA (as the Company’s initial shareholder) authorized the Company to adopt the 150% asset coverage ratio requirement.
In addition, while certain types of senior securities remain outstanding, the Company will be required to make provisions to prohibit the payment of any dividend distribution to our shareholders or the repurchase of such shares unless we meet the asset coverage ratio requirement at the time of the dividend distribution or repurchase. The Company will also be permitted to borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our total assets for temporary purposes, which borrowings would not be considered senior securities. The Company’s borrowings, whether for temporary purposes or otherwise, are subject to the asset coverage requirements of Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act.
We currently have in place a revolving credit facility (the “Subscription Facility”), two special purpose vehicle asset credit facilities (the “Wells Fargo Financing Facility,” and the “SMBC Financing Financing Facility,” respectively), and a term debt securitization (the "2022 Debt Securitization"),and in the future may enter into additional credit facilities and term debt securitizations. For more information on our credit facilities and the 2022 Debt Securitization, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Code of Ethics. The Company and each of the Advisers are each subject to a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions by the Company’s officers and the Adviser’s employees. The Company has also adopted a separate code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions by the Company’s independent directors. Individuals subject to these codes are permitted to invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by the Company, so long as such investments are made in accordance with such code’s requirements. You may obtain copies of these codes of ethics by e-mailing our Adviser at Investor.relations@churchillam.com, or by writing to our Adviser at Investor Relations c/o Churchill Asset Management, 430 Park Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10022. The code of ethics is also available on the EDGAR database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov. You may also obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov.
Affiliated Transactions. The Company may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from conducting certain transactions with its affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. 
The Company expects to co-invest on a concurrent basis with other affiliates of the Company and the Advisers, unless doing so would be impermissible under existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations, the terms of any exemptive relief granted to the Company and its affiliates, and the allocation procedures of Churchill. On June 7, 2019, the Advisers, the Company, and certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by either of the Advisers and/or their affiliates were granted an order (the “Order”) that permits the Company to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain funds and entities managed by the Advisers or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co-investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, subject to the conditions of the Order. The Company believes that the ability to co-invest with similar investment structures and accounts sponsored or managed by either of the Advisers and their affiliates will provide additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest with our affiliates if a ‘‘required majority’’ (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our directors who are not “interested persons” (as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act) of the Company make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. The Board will regularly review the allocation policy of Churchill.
In addition, pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC on April 8, 2020 and applicable to all BDCs through December 31, 2020 (the “Temporary Relief”), the Company was permitted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to complete follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company. Without the Temporary Relief, such private funds would not be able to participate in such follow-on investments with us unless the private funds had previously acquired securities of the portfolio company in a co-investment transaction with the Company. Although the Temporary Relief expired on December 31, 2020, the SEC’s Division of Investment Management had indicated that until March 31, 2022, it would not recommend enforcement action, to the extent that any BDC with an existing co-investment order continues to engage in certain transactions described in the Temporary Relief, pursuant to the same terms and conditions described therein. The conditional exemptive order is no longer effective; however, on October 14, 2022, the SEC granted the Company’s request to amend the Order to make the Temporary Relief permanent for the Company and permit the Company to continue to complete follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates that are private funds if such private funds did not hold an investment in such existing portfolio company.
Other. The Company will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act, and be subject to the periodic reporting and related requirements of the Exchange Act.
The Company is also required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to insure against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, the Company is prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to shareholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
The Company is also required to designate a chief compliance officer and to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws and to review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation.
The Company is not permitted to change the nature of its business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of its outstanding voting securities. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (i) 67% or more of such company’s shares present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of such company.
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
The Board has delegated the responsibility for voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Company to the Adviser, and has approved the delegation of such responsibility from the Adviser to Churchill, and has directed Churchill to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Company consistent with the duties and procedures set forth in Churchill’s policies and procedures. Churchill may retain one or more vendors to review, monitor and recommend how to vote proxies in a manner consistent with the duties and procedures set forth in such policies and procedures, to ensure that such proxies are voted on a timely basis and to provide reporting and/or record retention services in connection with proxy voting for the Company.
Churchill acts as a fiduciary of the Company and must vote proxies in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In discharging this fiduciary duty, Churchill must maintain and adhere to its policies and procedures for addressing conflicts of interest and must vote proxies in a manner substantially consistent with its policies, procedures and guidelines, as presented to the Board.
Any actual or potential conflicts of interest between the Company and Churchill arising from the proxy voting process will be addressed by the application of Churchill’s proxy voting procedures. In the event Churchill determines that a conflict of interest cannot be resolved under Churchill’s proxy voting procedures, Churchill is responsible for notifying the Board or the Audit Committee of such irreconcilable conflict of interest and assisting the Board or the Audit Committee with any actions it determines are necessary.
Proxy Policies
Churchill will vote all proxies relating to our portfolio securities in the best interest of our shareholders. Churchill reviews on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a shareholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by the Company. Although Churchill will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients’ portfolio securities, Churchill may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. Churchill will abstain from voting only in unusual circumstances and where there is a compelling reason to do so. Churchill may retain one or more vendors to review, monitor and recommend how to vote proxies in a manner consistent with the duties and procedures set forth in its policies and procedures, to ensure that such proxies are voted on a timely basis and to provide reporting and/or record retention services in connection with proxy voting for the Company.
Churchill’s proxy voting decisions are made by members of the applicable Investment Team who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. Any actual or potential conflicts of interest between the Company and Churchill arising from the proxy voting process will be addressed by the application of the Churchill’s proxy voting procedures. In the event Churchill determines that a conflict of interest cannot be resolved under Churchill’s proxy voting procedures, Churchill will be responsible for notifying the Board or the audit committee of the Board of such irreconcilable conflict of interest and assisting the Board or the audit committee of the Board with any actions it determines are necessary. 
Proxy Voting Records
You may obtain information about how Churchill voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending Corp., 430 Park Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY 10022, Attention: Chief Compliance Officer, Thomas Grenville or by emailing our investor relations team at NCDL-IR@churchillam.com. 
Privacy Policy
The following information is provided to help investors understand what personal information the Company collects, how the Company protects that information and why, in certain cases, the Company may share information with select other parties.
In order to provide you with individualized service, the Company collects certain nonpublic personal information about you from information you provide on your subscription agreement or other forms (such as your address and social security number), and information about your account transactions with the Company (such as purchases of our shares and account balances). The Company may also collect such information through your account inquiries by mail, email, telephone, or web site.
The Company does not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law. Specifically, so that the Company, the Advisers and their affiliates may continue to offer services that best meet your investing needs, the Company may disclose the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform administrative or marketing services on behalf of the Company, such as transfer agents, or printers and mailers that assist us in the distribution of investor materials. These companies will use this information only for the services for which they have been hired, and are not permitted to use or share this information for any other purpose.
We will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice if you no longer hold our shares of the Company.
The Company and the Advisers maintain internal security procedures to restrict access to your personal and account information to those officers and employees who need to know that information to service your account. The Company maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal information. 
Reporting Obligations
We furnish our shareholders with annual reports containing audited financial statements, quarterly reports, and such other periodic reports as we determine to be appropriate or as may be required by law. We are required to comply with all periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and other applicable requirements under the Exchange Act.
Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, as well as reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 regarding directors, officers or 10% beneficial owners of us, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a), 15(d) or 16(a) of the Exchange Act, are available free of charge by contacting the Adviser at: 430 Park Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, NY, 10022. Shareholders and the public may also view any materials we file with the SEC on the SEC’s website (http://www.sec.gov).
Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company
We have elected, and intend to qualify annually thereafter, to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Code. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends. Rather, dividends distributed by us generally will be taxable to our shareholders, and any net operating losses, foreign tax credits and other tax attributes of ours generally will not pass through to our shareholders, subject to certain exceptions and special rules for certain items such as net capital gains and qualified dividend income recognized by us. 
To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to be eligible to be taxed as a RIC, we generally must timely distribute to our shareholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of realized net short-term capital gains over realized net long-term capital losses (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). The following discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement.
If the Company:
•qualifies as a RIC; and
•satisfies the Annual Distribution Requirement,
then we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income that is timely distributed (or is deemed to be timely distributed) to our shareholders as dividends. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on the portion of our income that is not timely distributed (or deemed distributed) to our shareholders.. 
We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gain that we recognized in preceding years, but were not distributed during such years and on which we did not pay U.S. federal income tax (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”). While we intend to make distributions to our shareholders in each taxable year that will be sufficient to avoid any U.S. federal excise tax on our earnings, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entirely avoiding this tax.
In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things:
•continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year;
•derive in each taxable year at least 90% of gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale or other taxable disposition of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships,” or other income derived with respect to the business of investing in such stock or securities (the “90% Income Test”); and
•diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:
◦at least 50% of the value of its assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of its assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and
◦no more than 25% of the value of its assets is invested in (i) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (ii) securities, other than securities of other RICs, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) the securities of certain “qualified publicly traded partnerships” (the “Diversification Tests”).
For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company may be required to include in our taxable income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash. For example, if the Company holds debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount ("OID") (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), it must include in its taxable income in each year the portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by the Company in the same taxable year. The Company may also have to include in its taxable income other amounts that it has not yet received in cash, such as accruals on a contingent payment debt instrument or deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Because OID or other amounts accrued will be included in the Company’s investment company taxable income for the year of accrual and before the Company receives any corresponding cash payments, it may be required to make a distribution to shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though it would not have received any corresponding cash payment.
Accordingly, to enable us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may need to sell some of our assets at times and/or at prices that we would not consider advantageous, we may need to raise additional equity or debt capital or we may need to forego new investment opportunities or otherwise take actions that are disadvantageous to our business (or be unable to take actions that are advantageous to our business). If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources to enable us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we may fail to qualify for the U.S. federal income tax benefits allowable to RICs and, thus, become subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates (and any applicable state and local taxes).
We may be prevented by financial covenants contained in our debt financing agreements, if any, from making distributions to our shareholders. In addition, under the 1940 Act, we are generally not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain "asset coverage" tests are met. Limits on distributions to our shareholders may prevent us from satisfying the Annual Distribution Requirement and, therefore, may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a RIC or subject us to the 4% U.S. federal excise tax.
Although the Company does not presently expect to do so, we may borrow funds and sell assets in order to make distributions to our shareholders that are sufficient for us to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. However, the Company’s ability to dispose of assets may be limited by (i) the illiquid nature of its portfolio and/or (ii) other requirements relating to its status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If the Company disposes of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement, it may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If the Company is unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, it may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation.
Certain of the Company’s investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things: (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions; (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income; (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited); (iv) cause the Company to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash; (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of securities is deemed to occur; (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions; and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test described above. The Company will monitor its transactions and may make certain tax decisions in order to mitigate the potential adverse effect of these provisions.
A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, ordinary income plus the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses). If Company expenses in a given year exceed investment company taxable income, the Company would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, the Company may, for tax purposes, have aggregate taxable income for several years that it is required to distribute and that is taxable to shareholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income it actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. The Company may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event the Company realizes net capital gains from such transactions, a shareholder may receive a larger capital gain distribution than it would have received in the absence of such transactions.
Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
If we fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates (and also will be subject to any applicable state and local taxes), regardless of whether we make any distributions to our shareholders. If we have qualified as RIC and then we subsequently fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year or quarter of such taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions of the Code apply (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain U.S. federal income taxes at corporate rates or to dispose of certain assets). If we fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC and such relief provisions do not apply to us, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates (and also will be subject to any applicable state and local taxes), regardless of whether we make any distributions to our shareholders. In any taxable year that we do not qualify as a RIC, distributions would not be required and, if distributions were made, any such distributions would be taxable to our shareholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain holding period requirements and other limitations under the Code, any such distributions to non-corporate shareholders may qualify as "qualified dividends" that are subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 20%, and corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. The term “return of capital” merely means distributions in excess of our earnings and as such may constitute a return on an investor's individual investments and does not mean a return on capital..
Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under Subchapter M of the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the non-qualifying year, we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized during the five-year period after our requalification as a RIC, unless we made a special election to pay U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on such built-in gain at the time of our qualification or requalification as a RIC.
