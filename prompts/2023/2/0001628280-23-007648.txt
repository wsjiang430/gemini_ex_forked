Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Ovid is a biopharmaceutical company that is dedicated to reducing seizures and meaningfully improving the lives of people affected by rare epilepsies and seizure-related neurological disorders. We believe that epilepsy represents a substantial opportunity, both scientifically and commercially. Over the last decade, scientific understanding of the underlying biology of neuronal excitability and the pathophysiology of epilepsy has improved. This understanding of disease, coupled with advances in preclinical research tools, is improving the predictive potential of early research, and thereby, may increase the probability of successful clinical development of anti-seizure medicines ("ASMs"). The large global epilepsy market opportunity reflects the medical and economic potential. Epilepsy therapeutics today represent an $8 billion market globally, which is expected to grow. Evidence supporting the opportunity, includes the number of recent acquisitions of epilepsy assets. These have included acquisitions of rare epilepsy companies with a single, marketed product, which have secured values of greater than one billion dollars. The unmet need of people affected by seizures remains significant, with approximately three million Americans living with epilepsies today.
We have proven capabilities and expertise in the successful clinical development of ASMs. We have applied our knowledge to build a differentiated pipeline of medicines with potential first-in-class or best-in-class drug mechanisms of action ("MoA") to treat seizures. This pipeline has produced two epilepsy programs with potential first-in-class MoAs, and one epilepsy program with a potential best-in-class MoA. These programs include: soticlestat, which is a novel cholesterol 24 hydroxylase inhibitor. Takeda purchased our rights to soticlestat, and is currently evaluating it in two pivotal Phase 3 trials for Dravet syndrome and Lennox Gastaut syndrome. OV350 is a potential first-in-class direct activator of the KCC2 transporter, and is one among many KCC2 activator compounds in our portfolio. OV329 is a next-generation GABA aminotransferase ("GABA-AT") inhibitor that we believe has the potential to be best-in-class. It is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 study.
Our epilepsy development programs are anticipated to create a range of value-creating milestones in the near- and mid-term for investors. 
The Opportunity: Epilepsies and Seizure-Related Neurological Disorders
Although it is one of the earliest known maladies documented by humanity four millennia ago, today epilepsy remains a common, and often intractable, medical diagnosis. Approximately 50 million people globally experience epilepsy, including an estimated three million adults living with epilepsy in the United States. 
While modern drug discovery efforts have produced more than 30 anti-seizure medicines over the last 100 years, a substantial number of epilepsy patients, approximately 30 – 40%, continue to experience damaging breakthrough seizures. Many of these individuals suffer from rare forms of epilepsies. The seizures they suffer can have a devastating impact both upon patients and their families, by triggering permanent motor, cognitive and developmental delays, as well as epileptogenesis, which is a cascade of seizures begetting more seizures. Some patients with developmental epileptic encephalopathies experience even greater rates of refractory seizures that are resistant to drug therapy. 
With an estimated 70% of epilepsy diagnoses occurring in people less than 20 years of age, the need to treat seizures early and effectively is critical to mitigate worsening and permanent later-life disability. To achieve seizure control, approximately half of patients take a polypharmacy regimen of five or more ASMs, requiring careful management of drug side effects and interactions. The large population of patients requiring multiple drug therapies to control seizures, and persistent rates of breakthrough seizures, signal the urgent need for effective new medicines.
Scientific progress, including the availability of genetic testing, is illuminating the genetic underpinnings of seizures. Today, more than 1,000 genes are already associated with epilepsies. The great unmet medical need and scientific advancements have set the stage for a potential wave of neurotherapeutics, which we believe will be led by anti-seizure medicines.
The Ovid Strategy
The science underlying the discovery and development of new drugs for the brain has changed fundamentally over the last decade. We believe that major developments in the understanding of the biology of these diseases means that key areas of unmet need, including many epilepsies, are now addressable and offer significant medical and commercial potential. Our team has proven expertise in understanding MoAs that underlie seizures and shaping potential therapies to

treat rare epilepsies. This know-how affords us an ability to build Ovid in a manner deeply focused on delivering exciting and successive, novel medicines for epilepsies and seizure-related neurological conditions. 
Our strategy is to create sustainable, long-term value by advancing a broad pipeline of anti-seizure medicines. Our long-term intent is to complement our current pipeline with additional assets via focused business development activities that will eventually form the basis of a fully integrated epilepsy company with multiple commercial medicines and clinical stage programs. This corporate strategy is underpinned by specific research and development, financial and business development strategies. In addition, our Company seeks to protect shareholder value by creating multiple sources of potential revenue via clinical and commercial milestones from our pipeline, strategic collaborations and partnerships. 
Our approach to building an epilepsy franchise has already resulted in success, namely the development and subsequent repurchase of our rights to soticlestat by Takeda. In 2017, we in-licensed a 50% stake in soticlestat for $26 million, and further invested $57 million in designing and executing soticlestat’s early and mid-stage clinical trials. In 2021, following encouraging Phase 2 findings, which we delivered six months ahead of schedule, we entered into a Royalty, License and Termination Agreement ("RLT Agreement") through which we sold back our rights to soticlestat to Takeda. The RLT Agreement provided us with $196 million paid in Q1 2021 and, if soticlestat is approved and successfully commercialized, we are eligible to receive up to $660 million in sales and regulatory milestones payments and up to 20% of potential net sales-based tiered royalty payments. The RLT Agreement provides us with a potential stream of non-dilutive capital. The funds received from this transaction have enabled us to invest in our organization during a period when we believe the cost of capital would have been unduly expensive. 
In 2022, as we committed to our focus on rare epilepsies and seizure-related disorders, we conducted a strategic pipeline and organizational review. This led to a decision to out-license or terminate non-core programs, which we are in the process of executing. In addition, we determined and subsequently executed a reshaping of the organization, which led to a workforce reduction of approximately 20%. 
Expert Team and Customized Infrastructure
As a result of the strategic changes implemented in 2022, we have built a highly specialized and focused infrastructure that we believe will support us in our chosen area of epilepsies and make us a partner of choice for leading biopharmaceutical companies that wish to pursue valuable drug candidates or research platforms in seizure-related neurological conditions. This infrastructure spans the critical domains of research, development, delivery and commercial and market access strategy.
We have recruited a diverse team of professionals with subject-matter expertise in seizures and neurological conditions. This includes epileptologists, physicians, academic scientists, commercial and biopharmaceutical industry leaders. In total, we have five individuals with M.D. degrees and 13 professionals with Ph.D. degrees specializing in the sciences. Our operational and commercial leaders have extensive experience fostering market access and sales for leading neurological medicines. In total, our team’s collective professional experience has involved the successful development or commercial launch of 25 CNS medicines, including several epilepsy products.
Our cohesive focus in epilepsies and seizures, reinforced by our professional experience and pipeline of differentiated assets, gives us confidence we can succeed in our mission.
Research & Development Strategy
We pursue research and development for epilepsies and seizure-related disorders in a manner that is scientifically driven, patient focused, and which is enhanced by business development and academic collaborations. Whereas some epilepsy developers expressly focus on one biological target, we believe multiple MoAs are needed to treat the heterogeneous causes of seizures. Accordingly, our pipeline seeks to amass and develop a unique set of compounds and mechanisms that will collectively become a differentiated, leading epilepsy franchise.
Pipeline Focus
We cultivate a pipeline that utilizes a range of potential first-in-class or potential best-in-class MoAs to intercept and mitigate the neuronal excitability that causes seizures. The pipeline includes novel small-molecules compounds and genetic therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides, to treat rare, genetic seizure disorders. Collectively, our differentiated pipeline contains multiple potential value-creating drug programs. 
Table of Contents

Since we were founded in 2014, three potential MoAs to reduce seizures have emerged from our development efforts. Our portfolio of distinct development programs endeavors to maximize therapeutic opportunities by treating different types of seizures and underlying causes of neuronal hyper-excitability, while simultaneously mitigating potential risks that could occur from unforeseen setbacks associated with any single program. Our development programs seek to pursue the objective of delivering powerful seizure reduction while also striving for safe and well-tolerated side effect profiles. For epilepsy patients and clinicians who must regularly manage side effects associated with polypharmacy regimens, it is preferable to have medicines that are well tolerated and exhibit few drug-drug interactions. 
Our drug development approach generally seeks rare, resistant epilepsies as initial “sentinel” indications. Pursuing rare seizure conditions can enable us to demonstrate the rapid proof-of-concept for our compounds in resistant epilepsies, while additionally exploring efficient regulatory pathways and incentives. Case studies of the life-cycle management for prior anti-seizure medicines suggest that demonstration of refractory seizure reduction is often indicative of therapeutic effect in more common and tractable seizure types. Simply put: effective therapeutic outcomes in highly resistant seizures often bodes well for treating conditions with similar, but less severe seizure types.
As the field of anti-seizure medicine advances, we believe connections may be established between the root cause of seizures and other neurological conditions affecting larger populations. Our strategy focuses initially on evaluating our investigational medicines for pathways and targets impacting rare seizure conditions. If effective in rare disease, our intent is to explore expanding on that success to broader conditions of the brain for which the MoA may hold therapeutic relevance. Accordingly, in the future, we expect to be able to extend our knowledge and drug programs to other neurological conditions. This approach is supported by research indicating that more than ten ASMs are used in treatment of other (non-epilepsy) neurological diseases today.
Scientifically Driven
We take a scientifically driven approach to identify promising drug candidates for our pipeline. We are building our portfolio based on the existence of known biological rationales in excitability that are often associated with validated targets, and clear endpoints, such as seizures, for study in clinical trials. Leveraging our deep understanding of neurology, we identify differentiated MoAs for initial drug candidates. As we advance our drug candidates through nonclinical and clinical evaluation, we apply a systematic approach for de-risking compounds using emerging tools, animal models and trial designs. This paradigm is continuously informed and refined with emerging scientific and clinical insights to strengthen and de-risk development for prospective programs and trials.
Specifically, our approach is driven by the following scientific principles:
•Pursuit of validated and emerging targets. Because the underlying etiology and presentation of seizures is broad and varied, multiple drug MoAs will continue to be needed to treat epilepsy. We are building a pipeline of therapeutic development programs representing distinct MoAs, including validated and emerging biological targets in epilepsy. We seek to target biological pathways or genes for which proof-of-concept has been established via in vitro or animal models. Additionally, we prioritize targets that are uniquely expressed in the central nervous system, such as: cholesterol 24 hydroxylase, GABA-AT, and KCC2 co-transporters. 
•Blood brain barrier ("BBB") penetrant. The brain is one of the most difficult organs in the body to treat, in part due to the challenge of penetrating the blood brain barrier. Ovid’s drug development programs include potential small molecule therapies that demonstrate penetration of the BBB as well as antisense oligonucleotides. 
•Clinically translatable preclinical models. Recent advances in genetics enable us to employ predictive in vitro and in vivo genetic models of certain epilepsies and seizure-related disorders. We believe these predictive models will allow us to evaluate and observe a drug candidate’s potential activity prior to initiation of human trials. Applying these models, we believe we will be able to select the most relevant indication and seizure endpoints for our studies and increase the potential for clinical success.
•Clear primary endpoints and scales. We primarily focus on disorders that are characterized by epilepsy-related symptoms and seizures. Many seizure types afford clear observable endpoints and biomarkers that help capture and measure evidence of the clinical impact of our drug candidates. Our team of development experts has extensive experience designing scales to measure other symptoms common among seizure-disorders, such as 
Table of Contents

cognitive declines, movement deficiencies and behavioral manifestations. These skills support our desire and ability to develop medicines that may provide a clinical benefit across multiple aspects of patient health.
•Trial design enables early observation of proof-of-concept. By employing clinical endpoints that are highly relevant and designed to detect meaningful clinical benefits, we anticipate that many of our studies may provide early proof-of-concept in clinical development, thereby directing the use of our capital to projects with higher probability of later-stage success. 
•Motivated and accessible patient populations. We are targeting our programs for disorders with motivated and accessible patient populations. We believe that the patients and caregivers affected by epilepsies and seizure disorders have increasing access to diagnostics and genetic testing. Additionally, many are avid users of social media, through which they learn new insights about their conditions and share relevant information and experiences. We conduct patient disease community outreach and activities on digital platforms to efficiently identify new patients for our clinical trials, raise disease awareness and help connect with patients and caregivers. 
Pipeline Enhanced with Disciplined Business Development & Academic Collaborations
To support our strategy, we plan to enhance and expand our pipeline to include additional indications, therapeutic assets and technologies. We intend to facilitate our pipeline expansion via two, complementary efforts: (1) internal research and development efforts in collaboration with external leaders in the field and academic collaborators; and (2) business development activities to in-license or partner assets in our chosen area of seizures. 
Ovid conducts limited internal drug discovery, which helps us maintain lower costs for laboratory facilities. Instead, we seek to identify compounds with what we believe is untapped value sitting in other organizations’ pipelines and look to in-license or enter into collaborative agreements to secure such assets and advance clinical development. This strategy directs our efforts where we excel at creating value, which is specifically shaping translational and clinical-stage development in our therapeutic area. An integral part of our process is establishing collaborations with academic research centers to support translational expertise for our programs.
We believe that we are well positioned to execute on our business development strategy due to the extensive experience and networks of our management team. Specifically, members of our executive team have had extensive business development careers in the biopharmaceutical industry. Collectively, our senior management has transacted hundreds of in-licensing deals and collaborations.
Patient Focused
Ovid is developing product candidates that we believe have the potential to transform the lives of individuals affected by epilepsies and related neurological disorders. We believe that our therapeutic candidates may be able to meaningfully reduce harmful seizures, mitigate burdensome symptoms, and potentially alter the progression of disease, especially if they can be administered early in life in progressive epilepsy conditions. 
Patient communities are critical to informing every aspect of our approach. Each disorder for which we are developing potential neurotherapeutics is a condition that carries serious risk of morbidity and requires extensive and specialized involvement from the patients’ families, caregivers, physicians and from patient advocacy groups. 
Our strategy is enhanced by the following patient focused principles:
•pursue under-addressed rare conditions that can be evaluated via scaled clinical trials;
•develop close relationships with patient communities, caregivers, families, disease foundations and key opinion leaders, to better understand the history of these disorders, raise awareness, identify patients and facilitate enrollment of clinical trials;
•identify clinically meaningful endpoints, including seizures, cognitive and behavioral scales that are based on input from the patient communities and their physicians and caregivers; and
•develop digital capabilities to be deeply informed and engaged with the patient communities we serve.

Financial Strategy
We are focused on delivering long-term value for shareholders. Our financial strategy seeks to apply our capital in a focused manner to advance a differentiated pipeline of anti-seizure medicines, which we believe may generate multiple value-creating milestones from data and ultimately, commercial sales. 

Management believes that we have a sufficient cash runway to fund the operations of Ovid into the first half of 2025. If soticlestat is successfully approved and commercialized by Takeda, we will be eligible to receive additional capital, via potential milestone payments and royalties. These potential payments may provide a future source of non-dilutive capital to contribute to funding our operations and business development activities. 
Ovid Pipeline
Our efforts have already brought drug candidates from proof-of-concept into human clinical trials. Today, we are one of the few epilepsy-focused companies that has researched and developed three distinct MoAs to target seizures. We believe this pipeline of potential first-in-class or potential best-in-class mechanisms differentiates us and provides the basis of an attractive franchise of potential small molecule epilepsy medicines. 
The following table (Figure 1) sets forth our drug candidate programs and their development status, MoA, and anticipated near-term milestones:

Soticlestat: Eligible for Financial Stake Due to RLT Agreement with Takeda Pharmaceuticals
We retain significant financial interest in soticlestat, a novel cholesterol 24 hydroxylase (CH24H) inhibitor for the potential treatment of patients with resistant epilepsies, following our role in its successful early and mid-stage development program. We believe soticlestat has the potential to become a first-in-class compound targeting the metabolism of cholesterol in the brain. It has been shown to gradually reduce inflammation in the brain as well as indirectly acting on the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) pathway. We believe that this dual mechanism plays an important role in modulating excitatory signals involved in epilepsy, and thereby suppressing seizures.
Soticlestat is currently being studied by Takeda Pharmaceuticals in two global, pivotal Phase 3 trials for people with Lennox Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS). Takeda has stated in the first quarter of 2023, that if 
Table of Contents

these studies are successful, it anticipates submitting new drug applications ("NDAs") to support soticlestat in these indications in its fiscal year 2024 (April 2024 – March 2025). 
If soticlestat secures regulatory approval and is commercialized, under the RLT Agreement, we are eligible to receive regulatory and commercial milestones payments of up to $660 million, in addition to potential net sales based tiered royalties of up to 20%. Royalty payments are eligible on net sales across all regions and all future indications. The milestones payments do not include an initial upfront payment that we received in March 2021 of $196 million. 
Background on Takeda Royalty, License & Termination Agreement
The soticlestat development program began in January 2017 as a license and collaboration agreement between us and Takeda for rare epilepsies. Under this original agreement, Ovid held a 50% ownership stake in soticlestat and Takeda retained the remaining 50%. Following a successful Phase 2 development program led by us, in March 2021 we entered into the RLT Agreement. Under the terms of the RLT Agreement, we terminated our original collaboration agreement with Takeda, and Takeda subsequently secured an exclusive license and intellectual property rights to repurchase our 50% share in soticlestat. In exchange, we received an upfront payment of $196 million.. In addition, if soticlestat achieves regulatory approval, and is successfully commercialized, we are eligible to receive up to an additional $660 million in regulatory and commercial milestone payments and potential tiered royalties on net sales of soticlestat at percentages ranging from the low double-digits up to 20%, subject to standard reductions in certain circumstances. Royalties are payable on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis during the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of such product in such country and ending on the later to occur of the expiration of patent rights covering the product in such country and a specified anniversary of such first commercial sale. 
As a result of this agreement, Takeda secured all the global rights to develop and commercialize soticlestat for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, including Dravet syndrome and Lennox Gastaut syndrome. In addition, Takeda has assumed responsibility for all development and commercialization costs associated with soticlestat. We have no ongoing costs or obligations. 
OV329 – A next-generation GABA-AT inhibitor
OV329 is an investigational, next-generation GABA-AT inhibitor that we are developing for the treatment of adult and pediatric epilepsy disorders. OV329 represents a potential best-in-class GABA-AT inhibitor designed to supplant vigabatrin, which is an approved therapeutic in the United States and European Union for the treatment of infantile spasms. Sabril (vigabatrin) has demonstrated substantial seizure reduction, which led to sales of more than $300 million by Lundbeck in the United States alone. However, its clinical and commercial use has been limited by lack of a therapeutic window. Specifically, vigabatrin has generated deleterious ocular effects in some patients, including retinal degradation and irreversible vision loss that led to significant post-market restrictions and monitoring.
We believe OV329 to be an improved GABA-AT inhibitor with a different chemical structure than vigabatrin. OV329 potentially delivers increased potency and efficiency in the target binding site and has been shown in our preclinical research to be more than 200-fold more potent. If this preclinical data is confirmed in a clinical setting, we believe that OV329 has the potential to provide (in comparison to vigabatrin): 
• seizure reduction efficacy;
•an improved safety profile; and
•preferred (lower) dosing.
A benefit of our OV329 program is that it acts upon a validated drug target for seizures. Specifically, it works by substantially reducing the activity of GABA-AT, a key enzyme responsible for the degradation of the brain’s major inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. OV329 leads to increased concentrations of GABA by inhibiting its metabolism. Given that epilepsy is characterized by excessive neuronal excitation, the increased levels of GABA may suppress this excitatory signaling and may reduce seizures.
Six animal seizure models presented at medical conferences in 2022 demonstrate the seizure reduction potential of OV329 (see Figure 2). These findings in both chronic and acute seizure models provide additional confidence about the therapeutic potential of OV329 in humans.
Table of Contents

Figure 2. Six preclinical models reaffirm OV329 seizure reduction activity, including resistant seizure models
To further support OV329’s potential clinical development, our preclinical efforts sought to extensively characterize its safety and tolerability profile, including any potential ocular effects. We used a clinically translatable rodent model of albino Sprague-Dawley rats to determine if any ocular changes could be observed associated with the predicted therapeutic doses of OV329 and vigabatrin, as compared to placebo. This rodent model is an accepted proxy by the U.S. FDA for the ocular effects seen in humans treated with vigabatrin. Figure 3 demonstrates the results of our research. 
After 45 days of dosing with the therapeutic dose of vigabatrin and an expected therapeutic dose of OV329 (3 mg/kg), the model showed no ocular effect in animals taking OV329, whereas disruption in retinal cells was seen in animals taking the therapeutic dose of vigabatrin (300 mg/kg). In this model, OV329’s ocular profile appears similar to placebo, and no disruption to the retina was seen at the anticipated therapeutic dose. These models must be confirmed in human studies, though they lead us to believe that OV329 may offer significant seizure reduction benefit with a therapeutic window not provided by vigabatrin.
Figure 3. No ocular changes seen in rodents treated with expected therapeutic dose of OV329 (3 mg/kg)
In the second half of 2022, our Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for OV329 was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and subsequently, we initiated a Phase 1 trial. That study is currently ongoing at Duke University School of Medicine and will be conducted in two parts, including: a single-ascending dose and a multiple-ascending dose portion. Endpoints will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, tolerability and target engagement associated with escalating doses of OV329 in healthy volunteers. We expect to have complete findings of this study in the first half of 2024, including anticipated target engagement levels as measured by magnetic resonance spectrometry (MRS). Previous studies have reported MRS measurement of GABA concentration levels increase following treatment with 
Table of Contents

GABA-AT inhibitors, which has been shown to correlate with seizure reduction efficacy in prior GABA-AT inhibitor programs. If OV329 proves to effectively engage the target and exhibits a tolerable safety profile in the Phase 1 study, these metrics may inform mid-to-late-stage development of the program. 
Upon results from the Phase 1 program, we anticipate OV329 could be further studied for the treatment of seizures associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, Infantile Spasms, and other epilepsies associated with focal onset seizures. If the safety and efficacy profile of OV329 is positive, we will also consider lifecycle management strategies in broader epilepsy indications. 
OV329 entered our pipeline in December 2016, when we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with Northwestern University. The composition of matter patent for OV329 expires in 2036, excluding any potential regulatory extensions. We have also filed, and own, multiple patent families directed to the synthesis of OV329 and methods of treatment with OV329.
Portfolio of KCC2 Transporter Activators, Including OV350
We in-licensed a large portfolio of compounds from AstraZeneca in December 2021 that are direct activators of a biological target expressed exclusively in the central nervous system: the K-Cl co-transporter (KCC2). We believe this portfolio represents the only small molecule program in the biopharmaceutical industry that directly activates the KCC2 transporter. KCC2 is a channel that regulates chloride homeostasis in neurons, and thereby is potentially important in the control of neuronal excitability and seizures. The portfolio includes a lead compound, OV350, and several other compounds that we believe are suitable for pharmaceutical development. We intend to analyze multiple candidates from the KCC2 portfolio for development in epilepsy as well as other possible neurological conditions associated with behavior, neuropathic pain or neurodegeneration.
In vivo proof-of-concept studies in animals have established that restoring KCC2 activity leads to reduced seizure sensitivity and seizure-induced mortality. In one preclinical model, designed to mimic the acute seizure state of status epilepticus (SE), OV350 terminated status and restored the efficacy of diazepam in SE seizures, whereas diazepam treatment alone failed to halt the seizures. Preclinical mechanistic studies have also demonstrated that OV350 was well- tolerated and did not induce sedation. These findings must now be studied and demonstrated in humans.
In 2022, we evaluated several compounds in the KCC2 portfolio and began optimizing the lead candidate, OV350, for multiple possible formulations. Our desire is to achieve both intravenous and oral administration formulations for OV350. Dual formulations are optimal for patients who are treated acutely in the hospital and need to maintain seizure reduction in an out-patient setting. As we advance the program, we will continue to conduct preclinical experiments to inform the development of other compounds from the portfolio, for epilepsies and other neurological conditions. It is our expectation that the first IND from the program will be submitted in 2024. The library of early-stage small molecules that target the KCC2 transporter, including OV350, are included in a pending composition-of-matter application that was filed globally and, if issued, will expire in, 2041 excluding any potential regulatory extensions.
Genetic Research Programs
The majority of our development activities are dedicated to small molecule programs. However, we believe that genetic medicine will play an important role in the long-term future of treating genetic epilepsies and neurological disorders. Accordingly, we engage in appropriately scaled, early-stage research programs with certain collaborators, including Gensaic, a next-generation gene therapy developer (see description in License & Collaboration section below). 
OV815 and OV825 
 In 2022, we continued to progress candidates for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and RNAi medicines as part of our collaboration with Columbia University, including research programs OV815 and OV825. OV815 focuses on the mutations associated with KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND). Research has harnessed phenotype mapping and identified potential sequences that target a significant number of mutations associated with KAND. Similarly, OV825 has advanced to potential candidate lead identification for the rare neurodevelopmental condition HNRNPH2. Also known as Bain Syndrome, HNRNPH2 is an X linked gene, and most affected individuals are females. Patients with de novo mutations have delayed psychomotor development, intellectual disability, severe language impairment, seizures, behavioral abnormalities, acquired microcephaly, and feeding problems with poor overall growth. We have sought a RNAi therapy approach to target the mutant form of the HNRNPH2 protein that mislocalizes to the cytoplasm in cells from affected 
Table of Contents

individuals. By year-end 2023, we anticipate reaching a critical mass of research to be able to make "go" or "no-go" decisions on these programs.
OV882
OV882 is a short hairpin RNA that we are evaluating as a potential disease-modifying gene therapy for Angelman syndrome. The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is the loss of functional UBE3A protein due to a defect in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Our aim is to develop a disease-modifying vector that reduces expression of UBE3A-antisense and restores UBE3A expression via the paternal gene copy. We are in early stages of our research with OV882, and we benefit from robust natural history and baseline data from a prior clinical trial that we conducted with gaboxadol in Angelman syndrome. From this prior program, we have deep knowledge of the Angelman condition and retain ownership of baseline data from clinical trials with approximately 100 Angelman patients. We expect that these proprietary insights will aid our OV882 program.
Phage-Based Scaffolds: Gensaic Research Collaboration
In August 2022, we entered into a research collaboration with Gensaic (Gensaic Collaboration Agreement), a private biotech company that is developing gene therapies. Specifically, Gensaic is applying phage-display science that uses M13 phages as platforms to deliver genetic sequences. Though still in its nascence, we believe phage-based scaffolds may offer significant advantages for the delivery of genes, as compared to the current platform alternatives of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. 
AAV gene therapies are not optimal for treating neurological conditions. Specifically, AAV gene therapies have limited cloning capacity, which restricts their use for delivering large genetic cargo. Additionally, they are immuno-reactive, have poor BBB permeability, and provide relatively poor tropism to target cells. In contrast, we believe phages offer the potential to: deliver larger genes (up to 20kb); be engineered to cross the BBB and deliver cargo to specific cell types; avert the immune system response to enable redosing; and be produced in more cost effective manner. As a result, we believe phage-based gene therapy has an improved potential for the treatment of genetic epilepsies and neurological diseases. We can pursue up to three genetic targets in collaboration with Gensaic.
License and Collaboration Agreements
2022 Research Collaboration and Equity Investment in Gensaic
 Under the terms of an equity agreement we entered into as an investor in Gensaic, we invested a total of $5.1 million in exchange for convertible preferred stock in Gensaic. We also entered into the Gensaic Collaboration Agreement to potentially develop up to three genetic medicines for neurological indications of interest to us, harnessing Gensaic’s proprietary PDP platform. Gensaic retains full rights to its platform technology. We will have commercial rights to license and develop any resulting phage-derived gene therapies that emerge from this collaboration subject to agreed-upon terms. We also retained rights to invest in future equity financing rounds.
2022 Out-License Agreement with Marinus Pharmaceuticals
On March 1, 2022, we entered into an exclusive patent license agreement with Marinus, ("Marinus License Agreement"). Under the Marinus License Agreement, we granted Marinus an exclusive, non-transferable (except as expressly provided therein), royalty-bearing right and license under certain Ovid patents relating to ganaxolone to develop, make, have made, commercialize, promote, distribute, sell, offer for sale and import licensed products in the territory (which consists of the United States, the European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Switzerland) for the treatment of CDKL5 deficiency disorders. Following the date of regulatory approval by the FDA of the first licensed product in the territory, which was received on March 18, 2022, Marinus issued, at the Company's option, 123,255 shares of Marinus common stock, par value $0.001 per share. The Marinus License Agreement also provides for payment of royalties from Marinus to us in single digits on net sales of each such licensed product sold.
2022 License and Option Agreement with Healx
On February 1, 2022, we entered into an exclusive license option agreement ("Healx License and Option Agreement") with Healx, Ltd. Under the terms of the Healx License and Option Agreement, Healx has secured a one-year option to investigate gaboxadol (OV101) as part of a potential combination therapy for Fragile X syndrome in a Phase 2A clinical trial, and as a treatment for other indications, for an upfront payment of $0.5 million, and fees to support prosecution and maintenance of our relevant intellectual property rights. In February 2023, we amended the Healx License and Option Agreement to extend the option period by three months. At the end of the option period, Healx has the option to 
Table of Contents

secure rights to an exclusive license under our relevant intellectual property rights, in exchange for an additional payment of $2.0 million, development and commercial milestone payments, and low to mid-tier double digit royalties. Royalties are payable on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis during the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of such product in such country and ending on the later to occur of the expiration of patent rights covering the product in such country and a specified anniversary of such first commercial sale.
Healx will assume all responsibility for, and costs of, both development and commercialization of gaboxadol following the exercise of the option. We will retain the option to co-develop and co-commercialize the program with Healx, or the Ovid Opt-In Right, at the end of a positive readout of clinical phase 2B, in which case, and would share net profits and losses in lieu of the milestones and royalty payments. We do not plan to conduct further trials of gaboxadol. The term of the Healx License and Option Agreement will continue until the later of (a) the expiration of all relevant royalty terms, or in the event that Healx does not exercise its option during the option period defined in the Healx License and Option Agreement, or the Option Period, the expiration of such period, or in the event that Healx does exercise its option during the Option Period, and we do not exercise the Ovid Opt-In Right during the period of time we have to opt-in, or the Opt-In Period, or the opt-in terms are otherwise terminated, upon the expiration of all payment obligations, or (c) in the event that Healx does exercise the Option during the Option Period, and we do exercise the Ovid Opt-In Right during the Opt-In Period, such time as neither Healx nor Ovid is continuing to exploit gaboxadol. As part of the contractual obligations with Lundbeck, we will owe Lundbeck a share of all milestone and royalty payments received from Healx, if we do not exercise the Ovid Opt-In Right. If we exercise the Ovid Opt-In Right to co-develop and co-commercialize the program with Healx, we will owe a share of the net profit share to Lundbeck.
License Agreement with H. Lundbeck A/S 
In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Lundbeck, which we subsequently amended in May 2019, July 2020 and February 2022. As part of the Lundbeck agreement, we obtained from Lundbeck an exclusive (subject to certain reserved non-commercial rights), worldwide license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize OV101, also known as gaboxadol, for the treatment of human disease.
We subsequently closed our OV101 (gaboxadol) program in Angelman syndrome in early 2021. On February 1, 2022, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Lundbeck agreement, or Amendment No. 3, to permit our performance under the Healx License and Option Agreement. Under the terms of Amendment No. 3, if Healx exercises its option, we will owe Lundbeck a share of all milestone and royalty payments received from Healx, if we choose not to exercise the Ovid Opt-In Right. If we choose to exercise the Ovid Opt-In Right, co-develop and co-commercialize the program with Healx, we will owe a share of the net profit share to Lundbeck. 
2021 Exclusive In-Licensing Agreement with AstraZeneca
On December 30, 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the AstraZeneca Exclusive License Agreement, with AstraZeneca. Under the terms of the AstraZeneca Exclusive License Agreement, we have obtained worldwide rights to a portfolio of early-stage, small molecule compounds targeting the KCC2 transporter, including our lead compound, OV350. In exchange for an upfront payment of $5.0 million in cash and $7.3 million in shares of our common stock to AstraZeneca, we are responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to carry out all future development and commercialization of KCC2 transporter activators in epilepsies and potentially other neuropathic conditions. We are obligated to pay AstraZeneca potential clinical development milestones of up to $8.0 million, regulatory milestones of up to $45.0 million and total commercial milestones of up to $150.0 million, as well as tiered royalty payments ranging from the single digits up to ten percent on net sales. At the time of proof of clinical efficacy, AstraZeneca will have the right of first negotiation to opt in to co-develop and co-commercialize KCC2 transporter activators with Ovid. The license option will continue until the expiration of all relevant royalty terms.
Northwestern License
In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Northwestern, pursuant to which Northwestern granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to patent rights in certain inventions, or the Northwestern Patent Rights, which relate to a specific compound (OV329) and related methods of use for such compound, along with certain Know-How related to the practice of the inventions claimed in the Northwestern Patents.
Under the Northwestern agreement, we were granted exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the Northwestern Patent Rights for all uses. We have agreed that we will not use the Northwestern Patent Rights to develop any products for the treatment of cancer, but Northwestern may not grant rights in the technology to others for use in cancer. We also have an option, exercisable during the term of the agreement to an 
Table of Contents

exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights covering novel compounds with the same or similar MoA as the primary compound that is the subject of the license agreement. Northwestern has retained the right, on behalf of itself and other non-profit institutions, to use the Northwestern Patent Rights and practice the inventions claimed therein for educational and research purposes and to publish information about the inventions covered by the Northwestern Patent Rights.
Upon entry into the Northwestern agreement, we paid an upfront non-creditable one-time license issuance fee of $75,000, and we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $20,000, which will be creditable against any royalties payable to Northwestern following first commercial sale of licensed products under the agreement. We are responsible for all ongoing costs of filing, prosecuting and maintaining the Northwestern Patents, but we also have the right to control such activities using our own patent counsel. In consideration for the rights granted to us under the Northwestern agreement, we are required to pay to Northwestern up to an aggregate of $5.3 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for the first product covered by the Northwestern Patents, and, upon commercialization of any such products, will be required to pay to Northwestern a tiered royalty on net sales of such products by the Company, its affiliates or sublicensees, at percentages in the low to mid-single-digits, subject to standard reductions and offsets. Our royalty obligations continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim in a licensed patent covering the applicable product in such country and ten years following the first commercial sale of such product in such country. If Ovid sublicenses a Northwestern Patent Right, it will be obligated to pay to Northwestern a specified percentage of sublicense revenue received by us, ranging from the high single digits to the low-teens. 
The Northwestern agreement requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product that is covered by the Northwestern Patent Rights. 
Unless earlier terminated, the Northwestern agreement will remain in force until the expiration of our payment obligations thereunder. We have the right to terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice or for an uncured material breach by Northwestern. Northwestern may terminate the agreement for our uncured material breach or insolvency. 
Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. However, we do have internal market access and commercial strategy capabilities that inform our pipeline strategy and execution. As our pipeline assets move into the clinic in the future, we intend to build focused capabilities to commercialize our programs focused on epilepsies and seizure-related disorders. In markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our drug candidates. 
Manufacturing and Supply
We currently outsource all manufacturing, and we intend to use our collaborators and contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. However, certain members of our management have broad experience in manufacturing, which we believe may provide a competitive advantage.
Competition
We believe Zogenix, Inc. (acquired by UCB in 2022), Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, Sage Therapeutics, Inc., Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mallinckrodt plc, SK Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Epygenix Therapeutics, Inc., Stoke Therapeutics, Inc., and Xenon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are our most direct competitors with respect to soticlestat, OV329 and OV350. 
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any drug candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage and reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those drug candidates in the United States and in foreign countries.
Table of Contents

Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for the disorders we are targeting by a competitor could render our current or future drug candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our drug candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future drug candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyright protection, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 
While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions including the United States permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
We have exclusively licensed a portfolio of issued U.S. and international patents from Lundbeck directed to polymorphic forms of OV101 and their preparation and methods of manufacturing OV101. We have also filed, and own, multiple patent families directed to methods of treatment and formulations with OV101. 
OV329 was in-licensed from Northwestern University. OV329's composition of matter patent expires in 2036, excluding regulatory extensions. We have also filed, and own, multiple patent families directed to the synthesis of OV329 and methods of treatment with OV329. 
A library of early-stage small molecules that target the KCC2 transporter, including OV350 was in-licensed from AstraZeneca. The molecules are included in a pending composition-of-matter application that was filed globally and, if issued, will expire in, 2041, excluding any potential regulatory extensions.
In addition we have a library of proprietary genetic sequences that target UBE3A, KIF1A, HNRNPH2, and PDP2RD. We continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio to protect our library of potential development candidates. 
Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and any potential commercial partners and collaborators and invention assignment 
Table of Contents

agreements with our employees. We also have or intend to implement confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our selected consultants and any potential commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. Since patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in Interference, Derivation, Reexam, Post-Grant Review, Inter Partes Review, or Opposition proceedings brought by third parties or declared by the USPTO.
Government Regulation
The FDA and regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of drugs and drug candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (NDAs) or Biologics License Applications (BLAs), withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations.
•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
•approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated.
•performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication.
•submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA.
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable.
Table of Contents

•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1 clinical trial: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trial: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3 clinical trial: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Each of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, 
Table of Contents

among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain research must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that particular contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Table of Contents

Orphan Drug Act
Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of PDUFA fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, or an abbreviated NDA (ANDA) or Biosimilar application, to market a drug or biologic with the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a marketing authorization. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
Table of Contents

•refusal of the FDA to approve related pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of our drug candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws
Because of our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors, we will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business, including our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. 
The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate, among others, include: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective “business associates,” including their covered subcontractors, that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information; certain state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to 
Table of Contents

the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
In addition, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant penalties, including civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, and integrity oversight and reporting obligations.
Healthcare Reform
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
For example, implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or the PPACA, has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research and created a licensure frame work for follow-on biologic products. Since its enactment there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, President Trump has signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in PPACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Additionally, in January 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period

for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Congress is also considering additional health reform measures.
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. Further, the IRA, among other things (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Additionally, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. We expect that additional federal and state, as well as foreign, healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
