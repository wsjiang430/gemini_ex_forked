 Overview
Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc., or Oncternal, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel oncology therapies for the treatment of patients with cancers that have critical unmet medical need. Oncternal focuses drug development on promising, yet untapped biological pathways implicated in cancer generation or progression. The following table summarizes our current development programs:
Zilovertamab
Zilovertamab is an investigational, humanized, potentially first-in-class monoclonal antibody designed to: (i) bind to a specific functionally important epitope of Receptor tyrosine kinase-like Orphan Receptor 1, or ROR1, a growth factor receptor that is widely expressed on many tumors and that activates pathways leading to increased tumor proliferation, invasiveness and drug resistance, and (ii) inhibit ROR1 function. ROR1 is an attractive target for cancer therapy because it is an onco-embryonic antigen, a protein typically expressed during embryogenesis that may confer a survival and fitness advantage when reactivated and expressed by tumor cells. ROR1 overexpression in multiple tumor types, including mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, marginal zone lymphoma, or MZL, prostate cancer and breast cancer, and its expression has been associated with more aggressive disease, resistance to therapy and shorter progression-free survival, or PFS, and overall survival, or OS. In preclinical models, inhibition of ROR1 has shown anti-tumor activity, and we believe this may have additive or synergistic effects when combined with either targeted therapy, such as inhibitors of Bruton’s Tyrosine kinase, or BTK, or chemotherapy.
Preclinical studies demonstrated that zilovertamab binds with high affinity and specificity to ROR1, sparing healthy, non-cancerous tissues. When zilovertamab bound to ROR1, it blocked growth factor Wnt5a signaling, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration and survival, and induced differentiation of CLL tumor cells. Zilovertamab was developed in the laboratory of one of our scientific advisors, Professor Thomas Kipps, M.D., Ph.D., Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Director, Center for Novel Therapeutics and Co-Director, Hematology Malignancy Program at the University of California San Diego, or UC San Diego, Moores Cancer Center with support from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM. We have an exclusive, worldwide license with UC San Diego to develop zilovertamab for certain therapeutic uses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted orphan drug designations for zilovertamab for the treatment of patients with MCL and CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL, in 2020. Additional preclinical activities to evaluate zilovertamab in other cancer types, including hematologic and solid malignancies, are ongoing.
 We are launching Study ZILO-301, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled global Phase 3 registrational study evaluating zilovertamab in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL. Patients who achieve either a partial response, or PR, or stable disease, or SD, during an open-label lead-in with ibrutinib monotherapy are randomized to receive either zilovertamab or placebo while continuing to receive ibrutinib. The primary endpoint of Study ZILO-301 is PFS, and key secondary endpoints include objective response rate, or ORR, duration of response, or DOR, complete response, or CR, rate, OS and safety, including the proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decrease. The Study ZILO-301 design includes an interim analysis potentially supporting the submission of a BLA seeking Accelerated Approval with the FDA with a primary endpoint of ORR and a key secondary endpoint of DOR.
We are also conducting Study CIRM-0001, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating zilovertamab in combination with ibrutinib for the treatment of patients with MCL or CLL and in a recently opened cohort for patients with MZL.
In addition, we are supporting two investigator-sponsored studies being conducted at UC San Diego: (i) a Phase 1b clinical trial for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer study, including patients with resistance to approved androgen inhibitors, and (ii) a Phase 2 clinical trial of zilovertamab in combination with venetoclax, a Bcl 2 inhibitor, in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Both studies are open for enrollment.
ROR1 Cell Therapy
 ONCT-808, our lead cell therapy product candidate, is an autologous chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, T cell, or CAR T, therapy that targets ROR1, a target that is highly expressed by multiple solid tumors and hematological malignancies and confers both an aggressive phenotype and survival advantage to tumor cells.

ONCT-808 is advancing into clinical development as a potential treatment for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. ONCT-808 has been evaluated preclinically under an agreement with the Karolinska Institutet, and has been developed under collaboration agreements with Lentigen Technology, Inc., or Lentigen (lentivirus manufacturing) and Miltenyi Biotec B.V. & Co. KG., or Miltenyi (cell processing). In October 2022, we announced that we received a Study May Proceed letter from the FDA related to our investigational new drug application, or IND, for Study ONCT-808-101, a Phase 1/2 dose escalation clinical trial of ONCT-808, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma, including patients who have failed previous CD19 CAR T treatment.
A series of preclinical studies conducted by our collaborators from the Karolinska Institutet evaluated T cells as well as natural killer, or NK, cells expressing our ROR1 CAR containing the antigen binding region of zilovertamab. The ROR1 CAR mediated target recognition and cell activation when expressed in either T cells or chimeric antigen receptor natural killer, or CAR-NK, cells. Also, ROR1 CAR T cells demonstrated dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in an MCL mouse model.
 Additionally, our ROR1 cell therapy strategy includes the potential development of a next-generation cell therapy, which could include CAR-expressing immune cells bearing additional features to overcome barriers in the tumor microenvironment. targeting ROR1-expressing cancer cells in solid tumors Also, we are evaluating “off-the-shelf” or allogeneic CAR-expressing immune cells, such as CAR-NK cell therapies. We expect partnerships and collaborations to be essential for implementing our next-generation ROR1 cell therapy strategy.
ONCT-534 Dual-Action Androgen Receptor Inhibitor, or DAARI
 ONCT-534, our lead dual-action androgen receptor inhibitor, or DAARI, product candidate, is in preclinical IND-enabling development as a potential treatment for advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC, and other androgen receptor, or AR, driven diseases. DAARIs interact with both the N-terminal domain, or NTD, and the ligand-binding domain, or LBD, of the AR, inhibiting cell growth and inducing AR degradation, and have demonstrated preclinical activity in prostate cancer tumor models resistant to approved AR-targeting therapies. We believe ONCT-534 has the potential to address significant unmet needs related to important tumor resistance mechanisms, including LBD mutations, loss of LBD due to AR splice variants, and AR amplification.
In 2022, we initiated GLP toxicology IND-enabling studies in two relevant animal models as well as GMP manufacturing activities. In December 2022, we received helpful pre-IND meeting feedback from the FDA.
 ONCT-216
 Our program activities previously included ONCT-216, an investigational small molecule designed to inhibit the ETS, or E26 Transformation Specific, family of oncoproteins, which had shown in preclinical studies to alter gene transcription and RNA processing that led to decreased cell proliferation and invasion. In April 2022, we deprioritized the development of ONCT-216 and stopped the enrollment of patients in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory Ewing sarcoma, while continuing to study its mechanism and formulation under grant support.
 Our team
 We have assembled a management team, board of directors and scientific founders who have significant experience in successfully developing and commercializing therapeutics in oncology and orphan diseases, having worked or served on the Board of companies such as Amgen, Inc., Bavarian Nordic, Inc.

 Our strategy
 Our mission is to build a leading oncology company that creates novel and transformative treatments for a wide range of oncology indications for which there are significant unmet medical needs. We believe our investigational agents target novel cancer pathways and have unique mechanisms of action. Our current pipeline is derived from our ability to identify therapeutic candidates that have generated promising, late-stage preclinical results or clinical data, and in-license them for further development. We are particularly focused on therapeutic approaches for which there is a genetic or protein biomarker that can be used to identify populations of patients most likely to respond. We prioritize targets that we believe have the potential to transform the treatment paradigm of difficult-to-treat cancers with either single agent or combination therapy. As is the case for many oncology products, we believe that potential efficacy in one indication suggests the potential for application in other indications that carry the same target. Our focus is on hematological malignancies and prostate cancer as we believe our product pipeline can have the greatest impact in addressing unmet needs of patients diagnosed with these diseases.
 Key elements of our strategy are as follows:
 •advance zilovertamab through clinical development in multiple indications globally, with an initial focus on patients with relapsed or refractory MCL;
 •advance ONCT-808, our ROR1-targeting autologous CAR T cell therapy candidate, into a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with aggressive B cell Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, or B NHL, including those who have failed previous CD19 CAR T treatment, in the first half of 2023; 
 •advance ONCT-534, our lead DAARI product candidate, into clinical development for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer, as we expect to submit an IND in mid-2023; and
 •evaluate our product pipeline in preclinical studies in additional tumors with a focus on hematological malignancies and prostate cancer. 
 We expect partnerships and collaborations to be essential for implementing our strategy.

Business Update Regarding COVID-19
 The COVID-19 pandemic has presented substantial public health and economic challenges and continues to affect economies, financial markets and business operations around the world. The pandemic may continue to directly or indirectly affect the timeline for our manufacturing activities, planned regulatory submissions and clinical trials, including our global Phase 3 study of zilovertamab. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to directly or indirectly impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain or treat it, the success or failure of ongoing vaccination programs worldwide, the emergence and spread of additional variants of COVID-19, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets.

 Zilovertamab - monoclonal antibody targeting ROR1
 Zilovertamab scientific background: inhibition of ROR1 as a therapeutic strategy in cancer
 ROR1 is an onco-embryonic protein essential for normal fetal development whose expression is suppressed at birth unless reactivated as a survival factor by many different cancers. The switching-on of ROR1 is consistent with the general process of de-differentiation in cancer, in which normal cells lose their highly differentiated functions and return to a more primitive state, where they exhibit a greatly increased capacity for invasion, metastasis and resistance to treatment. This de-differentiation is associated with expression of a number of genes normally restricted to fetal development, one of which is ROR1. Cancer cells with the highest potential for self-renewal are sometimes referred to as tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells and are capable of invading other tissues or metastasizing to form tumors in distant sites in the body. These tumor-initiating cells are also the cells that have been found to be the most resistant to standard cancer therapies including chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Cancer cells that overexpress ROR1 have been shown to have increased survival, migration and resistance to chemotherapy.
 Histological staining of over 350 human tumor samples identified that a majority expressed ROR1, including 90% or more of uterine cancers, lymphomas and prostate cancers. Over-expression of ROR1 has been reported in multiple hematological and solid tumor types, as shown in the following table (Zhang 2012):
 

Cancer type | ROR1Expressed (%) | Cancer type | ROR1Expressed (%)
Uterus | 96% | Adrenal | 83% 
MCL | >95% | Lung | 77% 
CLL | 95% | Breast | 75% 
Lymphoma | 90% | Testicular | 73% 
Prostate | 90% | Colon | 57% 
Skin | 89% | Ovarian | 54% 
Pancreas | 83% | Bladder | 43% 

 
High ROR1 expression on patients’ tumor cells in a variety of cancers is associated with the development of metastases, and early relapse after therapy. ROR1 expression levels on patients’ tumor cells is higher in cancers that are more advanced or poorly differentiated. For example, whereas Grade 1 or 2 ovarian tumors were found to be 21% positive for ROR1, Grade 3 or 4 tumors were found to be 62% positive for ROR1. High expression of ROR1 has been associated with more aggressive disease and shorter patient survival in multiple tumor types, including CLL, breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
Inhibition of ROR1 signaling or silencing of ROR1 expression in multiple preclinical cancer models including breast cancer, ovarian cancer and glioblastoma, was associated with suppressing the expression of genes characteristic of tumor-initiating cells, and with repression of cancer migration and metastasis. Preclinical models also demonstrated that inhibition of ROR1, or blocking of Wnt5a-induced signaling, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration and survival, and induced differentiation of the tumor cells – resulting in fewer metastases and improved survival.
Inhibition of ROR1 has been demonstrated in preclinical models to be additive to, or synergistic with, chemotherapy agents such as paclitaxel, and with targeted therapy agents such as ibrutinib and venetoclax. In addition, inhibition of ROR1 has been shown to enhance sensitivity of cancer cells to targeted therapy with agents, such as erlotinib, and may increase apoptosis and decrease proliferation.

In summary, in addition to our Study CIRM-0001 Phase 1/2 clinical trial results described below, we believe ROR1 is an attractive therapeutic target in oncology for multiple reasons:
 •ROR1 is widely expressed on many cancers, including hematologic malignancies and solid tumors;
 •Expression of high levels of ROR1 on patients’ tumors is associated with more rapid disease progression, resistance to therapy and shorter patient survival, and therefore may represent an especially high unmet medical need;
 •Blocking of ROR1 activity in preclinical models inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration and survival, and induced differentiation of the tumor cells, thus depriving the cancer of essential functionalities;
 •Inhibition of ROR1 has been observed in preclinical models to be synergistic with certain chemotherapies and targeted therapies, potentially allowing for safer and more efficacious combination therapies; and
 •Clinical data presented by Merck for zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140), a ROR1-targeting antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, presented at the ASH 2021 Annual Meeting did not reveal any unusual or unexpected off-tumor organ toxicity. Zilovertamab is the ROR1 antibody used in Merck’s MK-2140 product candidate. 
 Two notable acquisitions in 2020 involved companies developing product candidates targeting ROR1: Merck acquired VelosBio, Inc. and its ROR1-targeting ADC (which was initially developed at Oncternal), and Boehringer-Ingelheim acquired NBE Therapeutics and its ROR1-targeting ADC.
 Zilovertamab development in MCL and CLL
 MCL disease overview
 MCL is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. There are approximately 4,200 new cases of MCL each year in the U.S., with the average age at diagnosis in the mid-60s. MCL is an aggressive lymphoma and carries a poor prognosis, with a median survival of about two to five years. The 10-year survival rate is only approximately 5-10%.
While there are several therapeutic options available to treat patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, we believe none of these options offers curative benefit, with most patients relapsing in less than 20 months. Inhibitors of Bruton’s Tyrosine kinase, or BTK, such as ibrutinib (Imbruvica), are emerging as a standard of care in patients who have failed other therapies. Most patients progress after 1-2 years of BTK inhibitor monotherapy (Rule et al 2017). As a result, we believe that there is a significant unmet need for more effective and better tolerated therapies.
CLL disease overview
 CLL is the most common form of leukemia in adults, accounting for 25-30% of all leukemias in the U.S. According to The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, an estimated 20,160 new cases of CLL were expected to occur in the U.S. in 2022, and in 2019 the prevalence of CLL in the U.S. was estimated to be 200,766 patients. CLL is primarily a disease of older adults. The median age at diagnosis is 71 years of age. Most patients are diagnosed as a result of routine blood work when elevated levels of lymphocytes are detected.
 BTK inhibitor therapy has emerged as a standard of care for CLL and is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as first-line therapy. Patients with CLL can experience a substantial period of disease control, but the disease eventually recurs, and is more likely to do so for patients with previous CLL therapy. Adverse events have been shown in a real-world analysis to limit ibrutinib treatment duration for almost half of all patients. An acceptable safety profile may be particularly important for patients with CLL who are older and may have multiple co-morbidities.
 According to Evaluate Pharma, the global market for CLL therapies was estimated to be $7.1 billion in 2022, largely driven by targeted therapies, including ibrutinib, venetoclax, and acalabrutinib. We believe that certain subpopulations of CLL represent particularly attractive initial clinical and commercial opportunities for zilovertamab.


Zilovertamab preclinical summary in MCL and CLL
 ROR1 is a potentially attractive target for cancer therapy because it is an onco-embryonic antigen, which is a protein typically expressed during embryogenesis that may confer a survival and fitness advantage when reactivated and expressed by tumor cells. ROR1 is over-expressed in many different cancers, including MCL, CLL, breast cancer and prostate cancer, and has been reported to be associated with more aggressive disease, resistance to therapy and shorter PFS or OS. In preclinical models, inhibition of ROR1 has shown anti-tumor activity and we believe may have additive or synergistic effects when combined with either targeted therapy or chemotherapy.
Zilovertamab is an investigational, humanized monoclonal antibody designed to bind to a specific functionally important epitope of ROR1. The ligand for ROR1 in hematologic malignancies is Wnt5a, a secreted glycoprotein that has a critical role in embryonic and fetal development. Researchers at the UC San Diego School of Medicine discovered that targeting a critical epitope on ROR1 was key to inhibiting Wnt5a activation, specifically targeting ROR1 expressing tumors. This led to the development of zilovertamab, which binds this critical epitope of ROR1. Preclinical studies demonstrated that zilovertamab binds with high affinity and specificity to ROR1, sparing healthy, non-cancerous tissues. Zilovertamab was not observed to bind to normal adult tissues in a Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, tissue cross-reactivity study.
 Preclinical studies have shown that ROR1 expression on tumor cells accelerated the development and progression of leukemia in animal models of CLL, and that Wnt5a enhanced CLL cell viability, migration and proliferation in a ROR1-dependent manner. Patients with high levels of ROR1 on their CLL cells have more aggressive disease and have a significant reduction in survival. An analysis of MCL and CLL patient samples has shown that ROR1 surface expression, as well as secreted Wnt5a levels, were comparable between patients with MCL and CLL.
 

Preclinical studies also showed that when zilovertamab bound to ROR1, it blocked growth factor Wnt5a signaling, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, migration and survival, and induced differentiation of CLL tumor cells. Preclinical studies with zilovertamab showed that treating MCL or CLL patient’s tumor cells with a combination of zilovertamab and ibrutinib led to reduced proliferation. Additional in vitro studies showed that the combination of zilovertamab plus BTK inhibitor remains active in certain MCL cells that had become insensitive to BTK inhibitor alone. In vivo studies conducted in mouse models of human CLL have shown that ibrutinib and zilovertamab exerted antitumor activities through independent pathways; that is, inhibition of BTK by ibrutinib did not alter ROR1 signaling, nor did it impair the rate at which zilovertamab blocked ROR1 signaling. The combination of both drugs reduced the size of the spleen, the primary site of leukemic disease in these mice, as well as the number of CLL cells in these spleens. Further preclinical studies suggested that zilovertamab was synergistic with venetoclax in vitro.
Zilovertamab clinical development in MCL, CLL and MZL
 Zilovertamab Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with CLL
 A Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of zilovertamab, which was funded primarily by Oncternal and CIRM, was conducted in 26 patients with actively progressing CLL who had relapsed or refractory disease. Patients received four doses of zilovertamab administered every two weeks in cohorts of three, with patients receiving escalating doses ranging from 0.15 to 20 mg/kg/dose. Zilovertamab infusions were generally well tolerated. There were no dose-limiting toxicities, no serious adverse events, and no discontinuations related to adverse events. The most common adverse events included anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, which were primarily attributed to the underlying CLL. Pharmacokinetic data showed a plasma half-life of approximately 32 days following four doses of zilovertamab at 16 mg/kg.
In this clinical trial, 22 patients were evaluable for response assessment; four patients who discontinued zilovertamab early without meeting criteria for progressive disease were not considered evaluable. No patients met criteria for complete or partial remission following this brief treatment. Seventeen of 22 evaluable patients had stable disease, or SD. Five patients had progressive disease. Most patients experienced reductions in their leukemic lymphocyte counts and were able to delay initiation of further treatments for an average of 262 days, at which point plasma levels of zilovertamab were undetectable. Although zilovertamab therapy was limited to four doses, one patient who received zilovertamab at 20 mg/kg had a greater than 50% reduction in lymphadenopathy. Analysis of blood samples from these patients prior to treatment showed significantly higher plasma levels of Wnt5a compared

to healthy matched controls. Patients also had high levels of expression of ROR1 on their CLL cells. In addition, when compared to baseline, cells from zilovertamab treated patients showed a reduction in expression of a panel of genes identified as being highly correlated with stem cells and oncogenic dedifferentiation. These results were consistent with preclinical observations that zilovertamab-induced ROR1 inhibition may drive cells away from a stem-cell-like profile.
 Zilovertamab Study CIRM-0001 in combination with ibrutinib in patients with MCL, CLL and MZL
 Oncternal and UC San Diego, with funding from CIRM, and a donation of ibrutinib product from Pharmacyclics LLC, are conducting Study CIRM-0001, an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of zilovertamab in combination with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL, CLL or MZL. This clinical trial was designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, or PK, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of zilovertamab in combination with ibrutinib in adult patients with adequate performance status and organ function. The study has 3 parts:
 Part 1 Dose Finding is a Phase 1b, open-label, sequential allocation, dose-finding evaluation of the sequential administration of zilovertamab monotherapy for 4 weeks followed by zilovertamab plus ibrutinib therapy in patients with MCL or CLL.
Part 2 Expansion is a Phase 2, open-label evaluation of the concurrent administration of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib in patients with MCL, CLL or MZL, using the recommended dose regimen for zilovertamab derived from Part 1.
Part 3 is a 2:1 randomized Phase 2 open-label, controlled, 2-arm, parallel group evaluation of the clinical activity and safety of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib versus ibrutinib alone in patients with CLL only.
We have completed enrollment of patients with CLL and MCL in all Parts of Study CIRM-0001, and those patients have either completed therapy or are in long-term follow-up. Following an evaluation of safety and PK data from Part 1, the recommended dose regimen, or RDR, of zilovertamab for Part 2 was determined to be 600 mg of zilovertamab administered intravenously every two weeks for three doses, followed by dosing every four weeks until disease progression or intolerance develop. This zilovertamab regimen was designed and chosen to be used in combination with 560 mg of ibrutinib once daily for patients with MCL, or 420 mg of ibrutinib administered once daily for patients with CLL, which are the FDA-approved doses of ibrutinib in these indications.
In December 2022, we presented updated interim clinical data from Study CIRM-0001 in patients with MCL and CLL at the ASH 2022 Annual Meeting. As of the October 11, 2022 data cut-off date, 28 of the 33 patients with relapsed/refractory MCL enrolled in Parts 1 and 2 were evaluable for efficacy and all 34 patients with CLL enrolled in Parts 1 and 2 were evaluable for efficacy. For Part 3 of the study, 23 of 31 patients with CLL were evaluable for efficacy, of which 16 received zilovertamab plus ibrutinib and seven received ibrutinib alone.
Zilovertamab Study CIRM-0001 interim clinical data in MCL
 Evaluable patients with relapsed/refractory MCL had high-risk factors and were heavily pre-treated at study entry, 52% with a high Ki-67 proliferative index (≥30%), 47% with TP53 mutations, and 46% with intermediate or high simplified MCL international prognostic impact (sMIPI) score. The clinical outcomes reported for the 28 evaluable patients were encouraging: (i) 25 (89%) achieved an overall response (CR or PR), (ii) 12 (43%) achieved a CR at 26 months as compared to 5 (18%) at three months, (iii) 13 (46%) achieved a PR, and (iv) one (4%) had SD, for a total clinical benefit rate (CR, PR, SD) of 93% as of the data cut-off date. Tumor responses were achieved rapidly (Figure 1). The ORR and median duration of response were encouraging in patients with high-risk features associated with difficult to treat disease. High Ki-67 (≥30%) patients had an ORR of 86% and a median duration of response of 30.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9 months – not evaluable, or NE). Five patients had received prior treatment with ibrutinib, with three achieving CRs and two achieving PRs for an ORR of 100%. Median PFS was not reached (95% CI 33.2 months – NE) after a median follow-up of 19.5 months (95% CI 19.5 months to 28.5 months) and the landmark PFS at 24 months was over 70% (Figure 2). The combination demonstrated robust and consistent efficacy results regardless of pretreatment status as the PFS was 33.2 months

(95% CI 17.3 months to NE) and not reached (95% CI 4.3 months to NE) in patients who received 1 and 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy, respectively (Figure 3). Similarly, the PFS across different prognostic sMIPI scores was encouraging and consistent with the overall population (Figure 4).

We believe these results suggest synergy with the combination of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib and have the potential to translate into significantly improved clinical outcomes, because they compare favorably with published historical data for single agent ibrutinib of a merged analysis of 370 patients with relapsed/refractory MCL from three clinical trials who had received a median of two prior therapies, which showed an ORR of 66%, CR rate of 20%, and median PFS of 12.8 months (95% CI 8.5 – 16.6 months). Extended follow-up of up to nearly 10 years of this merged analysis with ibrutinib alone (Dreyling et al., 2022) revealed similar outcomes with ORR of 69%, CR rate of 27% and median PFS of 12.5 months (95% CI 9.8 – 16.6 months). However, the information provided above, as well as additional data from third party studies below, is for illustrative purposes only and is not based on a head-to-head comparison. Differences exist between study or trial designs and subject characteristics, and caution should be exercised when comparing data across studies.
 The majority of drug-related treatment-emergent adverse event, or TEAEs, and all Grade 3 or higher TEAEs in Study CIRM-0001 were deemed to be related to ibrutinib by the Investigators. There have been no dose-limiting toxicities and no serious adverse events attributed to zilovertamab alone. For the entire safety population (85 patients) which includes patients with CLL or MCL, atrial fibrillation was observed in only 9.4% of the patients and febrile neutropenia in 1.2% of patients. No Grade 3 or higher TEAEs were deemed to be related to zilovertamab alone, and no new events were deemed to be unique to the combination therapy. The adverse event profile for ibrutinib plus zilovertamab was consistent with or slightly improved compared to the published literature and prescribing information for single agent ibrutinib. Encouraging TEAEs related to myelosuppression appeared to be lower than expected for ibrutinib treatment, so quantitative analysis of complete blood count data for MCL was undertaken. Grade 3 or greater neutrophil decrease and platelets decrease of 9.1% for zilovertamab plus ibrutinib, respectively, appear to be qualitatively lower than the 29% Grade 3 or greater neutrophils decreased and 17% platelets decreased reported for the ibrutinib MCL registration study. This could be related to the observation that residual tumor cells during ibrutinib treatment express ROR1, which is activated by its ligand Wnt5a, leading to cross-activation of inflammatory pathways including JAK/STAT and secretion of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines including IL6 and IFN-gamma. Zilovertamab has been shown to inhibit this inflammatory activity.
 Efficacy results for the evaluable population of patients with MCL are presented in the following figures, along with relevant literature results for single-agent ibrutinib.

Zilovertamab Study CIRM-0001 December 2022 interim clinical data in CLL
 Of the 34 evaluable patients with CLL from Parts 1 and 2, and 16 evaluable patients from Part 3 that received the combination of zilovertamab and ibrutinib as of the data cut-off date, 20 patients were treatment naïve and 30 patients had relapsed/refractory CLL. Ten of the evaluable patients had CLL with 17p deletions and/or TP53 mutations, including five patients with treatment-naïve CLL and five patients with relapsed/refractory CLL.
Landmark PFS and OS were 100% at 42 months and 40 months, respectively, in both treatment-naïve and relapsed/refractory TP53/del(17p) patients that received the combination of zilovertamab and ibrutinib. The most recent data update from the ALPINE study in TP53/del(17p) patients showed a landmark PFS of 77.6% at 24 months for zanubrutinib monotherapy and 55.7% at 24 months for ibrutinib monotherapy (Brown 2022, ASH). TP53 mutations are among the most commonly acquired mutations in cancer, including hematological malignancies, and are associated with decreased survival and predict inadequate therapeutic response.
Landmark PFS was 95% at 24 months in all patients with relapsed/refractory CLL treated with the combination of zilovertamab plus ibrutinib in Parts 1 and 2 of the study. The most recent data update from the ALPINE study in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL showed a landmark PFS at 24 months of 79.5% for zanubrutinib and 67.3% for ibrutinib monotherapy (Brown 2022, ASH).
Data from Part 3 of the study continue to mature, and median PFS for both arms had not been reached as of the October 11, 2022 cut-off date after a median follow up of 29 months and 30 months for the combination of zilovertamab and ibrutinib and ibrutinib monotherapy arms, respectively.
 Efficacy results for the evaluable population of patients with CLL are presented in the following figures, in some cases along with relevant published results for single-agent ibrutinib and zanubrutinib.

Zilovertamab Phase 3 Study ZILO-301 in patients with Relapsed/Refractory MCL
 In the second half of 2022, we announced the initiation of our Phase 3 global registrational trial of zilovertamab, Study ZILO-301, for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory MCL. The Phase 3 clinical trial entitled “A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multicenter Study of Zilovertamab (A ROR1 Antibody) Plus Ibrutinib Versus Ibrutinib Plus Placebo in Subjects with Relapsed or Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma” (NCT05431179) will evaluate the potential benefit of zilovertamab for patients who have only experienced SD or a

PR after having received four months of oral ibrutinib therapy during the open-label lead-in phase of the study. Patients with such an inadequate response (PR or SD) will be randomized (1:1) to receive zilovertamab (600mg administered by IV every 2 weeks for 3 administrations and then every 4 weeks thereafter) or placebo, while continuing to receive oral ibrutinib. Across 50-100 international centers, the study aims to enroll 365 patients and to randomize approximately 250 patients after the 4-month lead-in phase.
 An interim analysis, designed to support submission of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, seeking accelerated FDA approval, will be conducted based on a primary endpoint of ORR and a key secondary endpoint of DOR. The final analysis, intended to support regular FDA approval, will be based on a primary endpoint of PFS. Secondary efficacy endpoints include ORR, DOR, CR Rate, OS, and the proportion of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 neutrophil count decrease.
 Based on positive feedback from the FDA, we are also considering conducting Study ZILO-302, an open-label companion clinical trial to Study ZILO-301. Patients who have progressive disease during the initial four months of ibrutinib monotherapy from Study ZILO-301 may be enrolled and treated with zilovertamab plus ibrutinib, to determine whether ROR1 inhibition can sensitize patients to ibrutinib therapy.
Zilovertamab development in prostate cancer
 Prostate cancer disease overview
 Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer among men in the U.S. behind skin cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. While patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma have 5-year survivals that approach 100% according to the SEER Program database, outcomes are much more dismal in the metastatic setting, with an estimated 5-year survival of 30%. Much of this mortality is attributed to castrate resistant disease, in which the malignancy develops the ability to progress despite androgen deprivation or inhibition. In its castrate resistant state, the disease is characterized by impaired quality of life and diminished survival. Current management strategies include hormonal and cytotoxic therapies. Though these approved therapeutic agents have slightly prolonged survival for patients with this disease, responses are not durable and nearly all patients develop resistance. Moreover, many of these therapies are not targeted and in the case of cytotoxic therapies, are associated with toxicity and poor tolerability. Despite a growing understanding of the molecular signaling associated with prostate cancer growth, there remains a paucity of targeted therapies in the management of prostate adenocarcinoma.
 ROR1 is expressed by approximately 90% of prostate cancers, and the Wnt5a signaling pathway is activated in patients with advanced prostate cancer that is progressing while on treatment with an AR inhibitor. Treatment of prostate cancer cell lines with an AR inhibitor was found to increase the expression of Wnt5a, and the addition of Wnt5a attenuated the antiproliferative effect of AR inhibition. The expression of Wnt5a in the tumors of patients with mCRPC has been associated with poor OS. Notably, ROR1 expression has also been shown on certain prostate cancer cell lines that had lost dependence on the AR signaling pathway, an important mechanism of resistance development in advanced prostate cancer. We are collaborating with academic investigators to investigate the potential effects of zilovertamab on this disease.
 Zilovertamab clinical development in prostate cancer
 An investigator-sponsored prospective, open-label, non-randomized, one-arm Phase 1b study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of, and to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose, or RP2D, of, docetaxel combined with zilovertamab in patients with mCRPC is recruiting patients at UC San Diego. During the treatment period, zilovertamab and docetaxel will be administered by IV infusion on an outpatient basis. Initially, zilovertamab be given as a series of loading doses with biweekly IV infusions on days 1, 15, and 29 of cycle 1. Following this, zilovertamab will be given concurrently with docetaxel (cycles 2 up to 6 depending on tolerance to docetaxel) and each cycle will be 21 days in length. Patients will be treated for a maximum of six cycles with combination therapy. Following completion or discontinuation of docetaxel, cycle length will be 28 days and zilovertamab will be

administered day one of every 28-day cycle starting at cycle eight (or earlier depending on tolerance). Zilovertamab will be administered IV on day one of the cycle.
Zilovertamab development in breast cancer
 Zilovertamab was evaluated in an investigator-sponsored single-arm, open-label, Phase 1b trial of zilovertamab in combination with paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer. The primary objective of this trial was to determine the safety and tolerability during the first four weeks of fixed dose zilovertamab when administered in combination with weekly standard of care paclitaxel to patients with metastatic, or locally advanced, unresectable breast cancer. The treatment regimen was zilovertamab at a dose of 600 mg on days 1 and 15 of cycle 1, and then on day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle, and paclitaxel weekly at a dose of 80 mg/m2. The study was completed by UC San Diego and analyzed based on a data cut-off of August 12, 2021. Twenty-three patients were screened, and 16 were treated with paclitaxel and zilovertamab. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of paclitaxel alone. There were no dose limiting toxicities, no discontinuations and no serious adverse events attributed to zilovertamab. Adverse events possibly related to zilovertamab included nausea, neutrophil count decreased, and constitutional symptoms. Among the 16 patients in the intent-to-treat population, the ORR was 37.5% (95% CI 15.2% - 64.6%) with six patients experiencing PR, and the best response rate, including SD, was 75.0% (95% CI 47.6% - 92.7%).
Additional potential clinical opportunities for zilovertamab in other solid tumors
 Lung cancer. ROR1 is expressed by approximately 77% to 93% of lung cancers. In adenocarcinoma of the lung, higher levels of ROR1 expression were correlated with advanced stages of disease and with positive lymph node metastases. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated an association of high ROR1 expression with worse OS in lung adenocarcinoma patients. ROR1 expression has been shown in lung cancer to be correlated with the presence of other negative prognostic factors such as phosphorylated AKT, or p-AKT, or phosphorylated CREB, or p-CREB. Inhibition of ROR1 in lung cancer cell lines induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and led to a reduction in levels of p-CREB and p-AKT. Notably, a recent preclinical study has shown that downregulating ROR1 expression re-sensitizes erlotinib-resistant lung cancer cells to an EGFR inhibitor drug.
Ovarian cancer. ROR1 is expressed by approximately 54% of ovarian cancers, which is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy among women worldwide. Analysis of ROR1 expression on ovarian cancer patient samples revealed that disease-free survival and OS rate in patients with high ROR1 expression were significantly lower than in patients with low or no ROR1 expression. In a preclinical study, it was shown that a ROR1 antibody inhibited growth of ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro and slowed tumor growth in a mouse model. Zilovertamab also demonstrated an anti-proliferative effect on certain ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines in vitro.
 Pancreatic cancer. ROR1 is expressed by approximately 83% of pancreatic cancers. A recent preclinical study has shown that blocking ROR1 led to apoptotic cell death, which was further enhanced in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs such as erlotinib and ibrutinib, when tested against a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines.
 ROR1 CAR T Cell Therapy
 We are developing our CAR T cell therapy candidate based on the ROR1 binding domain of zilovertamab to treat patients with hematological malignancies or solid tumors. We believe that the selective expression of ROR1 on many tumor cells and its absence on normal cells make it an ideal target for a CAR T cell therapy approach. In addition, we believe that ROR1-negative relapses might be less likely to develop after ROR1 CAR T cell therapy, because the survival benefit imparted on cancer cells by ROR1-associated activities may limit the development of ROR1-negative tumors, such that tumor cells that lose or mutate ROR1 to escape CAR T cell treatment may be less aggressive than the parental cells. In late 2022, we received a Study May Proceed letter from the FDA for a Phase 1/2 dose escalation clinical study of ONCT-808, an autologous CAR T therapy candidate targeting ROR1, in patients with aggressive B NHL, including those who have failed previous CD19 CAR T treatment. We are pursuing a two-pronged development strategy for our ROR1 CAR T cell therapy program. The first part of the strategy is to evaluate evidence of safety and clinical activity of our ROR1 CAR T cell therapy in humans while using an established autologous CAR T approach and targeting hematological indications that are known to be

susceptible to CAR T cell therapy. The second part of the strategy will evaluate autologous therapies for advancement on a stand-alone basis as well as to develop next-generation cell therapies targeting ROR1 by introducing more advanced cell therapy technologies, which could include CAR T cells bearing additional features to overcome the solid tumor microenvironment, as well as “off-the-shelf” or allogeneic CAR T cell or CAR-NK cell therapies.
 We expect partnerships and collaborations to be essential for implementing our next-generation strategy. In January 2021, we announced a research and development collaboration with Karolinska Institutet to investigate novel optimized ROR1-targeting cell therapies focused on CAR T cells and CAR-NK. In April 2022, we established a clinical manufacturing agreement with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to conduct cGMP cell preparation and manufacturing activities for use in first-in-human studies of our ROR1-targeting CAR T cell therapy candidate ONCT-808. In September 2021, we announced a research collaboration with Celularity Inc., or Celularity, to evaluate placental derived-cellular therapies targeting ROR1. As part of the collaboration, Celularity explored in preclinical studies: (i) the use of zilovertamab in combination with Celularity’s natural killer cells, and (ii) ROR1-targeted CAR gene modification in Celularity’s CYNK natural killer cell and CyCAR-T cell platforms. The data generated in the Celularity collaboration was supportive of potentially conducting further research.
We are also collaborating with Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd. for our CAR T cell therapy program, through its U.S. subsidiary Shanghai Pharmaceutical (USA) Inc., or SPH USA. SPH USA entered into the SPH USA License Agreement with us to develop ROR1-targeted CAR T cell therapy product candidates in greater China. One of SPH USA’s Chinese affiliates intends to conduct one or more initial clinical trials of the licensed ROR1 CAR T cell therapy candidate at hospitals in China that have experience with processing cellular immunotherapy materials and conducting CAR T cell therapy clinical trials.
Scientific background: CAR T cell therapy overview
 
Immuno-oncology approaches to treating cancer involve redirecting one of the pillars of the immune system, the adaptive immune system, so that it specifically and efficaciously recognizes cancerous cells that might previously have escaped immune recognition. A key element in the adaptive immune response is the T cell that can recognize and kill infected and abnormal cells. T cells also act to signal other immune cells to respond to threats. T cells recognize their targets because they are selected in a way that allows them to specifically recognize foreign antigens on the surface of other cells.
 T cells are well suited for immuno-oncology applications based on several characteristics. They have evolved to be exquisitely specific and avid killers. One T cell can eliminate numerous target cells. T cells are extremely specific, able to recognize a cancer cell and kill it, while ignoring an almost identical healthy cell. T cells are thought to be vigilant all the time, eliminating cancer cells from the body before they can form tumors. However, tumor cells sometimes evolve to escape T cell killing by activating a number of pathways that suppress T cell function. Adoptive T cell therapies, and specifically CAR T cells, are being developed to provide methods to generate large quantities of T cells capable of specifically recognizing and killing tumor cells despite tumor suppressive mechanisms.
 CAR T cells are generated by isolating T cells from patients and modifying them to recognize specific antigens on tumors. T cells have potent cell killing activity that is directed to target cells that are recognized by specific T cell receptors, or TCRs, that are expressed on the surface of these T cells. While some T cells have TCRs that can recognize cancer cells leading to their killing, potent T cells do not develop against all tumor targets. In some cases, the potential cancer cell target is also a protein that has an essential role in other tissues or at other stages of development, and TCRs that recognize these targets are eliminated during normal T cell development.
 CAR T cell therapy has emerged as a way to engineer T cells to recognize specific targets, such as those that are selectively expressed on cancer cells. A gene encoding a chimeric protein is constructed that contains a single antigen-binding domain of an antibody that specifically recognizes the target, which is coupled to a T cell costimulatory domain and a portion of the T cell receptor.


CAR T cell therapies are typically produced from a patient’s own T cells, which are isolated by leukapheresis. These cells are then genetically modified with a chimeric antigen gene construct which can be delivered by various mechanisms, such as lentiviral gene delivery vectors. Transduced cells are then expanded and undergo quality testing before being reintroduced into the same patient. This approach is also known as autologous CAR T cell therapy.

DAARI Program
ONCT-534, our lead Dual-Action Androgen Receptor Inhibitor, or DAARI program candidate, is a novel investigational, potentially first-in-class, orally bioavailable, AR dual-action inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with mCRPC and other AR-driven diseases. Based on preclinical studies, we believe ONCT-534 has the potential to be a novel treatment option for patients with advanced prostate cancer. We licensed ONCT-534 and certain other DAARI program rights from the University of Tennessee Research Foundation, or UTRF, under an exclusive, worldwide license agreement.
Figure 10. Schematic Representation of Clinically Relevant Domains of the Androgen Receptor
 
   We have chosen AR antagonism and degradation as our target mechanism of action focus due to the well-documented biology of AR signaling as the principal driver of prostate cancer. ONCT-534 has demonstrated activity in preclinical models of AR overexpression, AR LBD mutations, as well as AR splice variants, all common mechanisms of resistance to current standard of care agents in advanced prostate cancer. ONCT-534 has a potentially novel and unique mechanism of action: interacting with both the NTD and LBD of the AR, inhibiting AR function as well as inducing AR protein degradation. We believe that this NTD binding is relevant to the activity of ONCT-534 against tumors expressing AR splice-variants that do not contain an LBD. Current standard of care treatment options, such as enzalutamide or apalutamide, bind only to the LBD of the AR, which may explain their reduced efficacy in patients with AR-SV-expressing tumors, as these AR variants lack the LBD. We believe that the differentiated dual-action pharmacology of ONCT-534 has the potential to translate into improved clinical outcomes over current standard of care agents.


Prostate cancer overview
 Approximately one-third of all prostate cancer patients who have been treated for local disease with curative intent will subsequently have rising serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which is an indication of recurrent disease with or without development of distant metastasis. Patients with recurrent disease as indicated by rising PSA usually undergo androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT. While most of these patients initially respond to ADT, many experience a recurrence in tumor growth despite the reduction of testosterone to castrate levels, and at that point are considered to have castrate resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC. Following diagnosis of CRPC, patients have generally been treated with anti-androgens that competitively block the binding of androgens (darolutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide or bicalutamide) to the AR resulting in functional inhibition of the AR signaling pathway, or inhibit synthesis of androgens (abiraterone). More recently, significant improvements in PFS and OS have been achieved by utilizing this latest generation of antiandrogens in combination with ADT earlier in the disease natural history, such as hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, or HSPC, and non-metastatic CRPC, or nmCRPC.
The growth of prostate tumors is in large part mediated by an activated AR pathway. Generally, there are three means of activating the AR. First, androgens, such as dihydrotestosterone, can activate the AR by binding to its LBD. Second, CRPC can be driven by variants of AR that lack an LBD, are constitutively activated, and consequently do not require androgens for activation. A third mechanism may involve certain signaling pathways that activate AR independent of androgen activity. Generally, current drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer are directly inhibiting activation of the AR pathway by: (i) interfering with the production of androgen, or (ii) preventing androgen from binding to the LBD. Over time, these approaches will eventually fail due to mechanisms of resistance, which involve the LBD end of the receptor, whether at the DNA level via AR amplification, or via LBD mutations, or at the RNA level via the emergence of AR splice variants. With respect to the development of alternative pathway mechanisms of AR activation, tumors might also be insensitive to antiandrogen activity. Lastly, in patients who have been treated for years with various antiandrogen therapies, genomic changes may lead to additional, non-AR-related oncogenic drivers, also insensitive to inhibition of AR pathway biology.
Mechanism of Action
As a DAARI, ONCT-534 has a potentially novel and unique mechanism of action: it interacts with both the NTD and the LBD of the AR (Figure 10 above), inhibiting AR function and leading to AR protein degradation. We believe that this NTD binding is relevant to the activity of ONCT-534 against tumors expressing AR splice-variants by preventing AR activation. In this respect, ONCT-534 is designed to mechanistically differ from classical non-steroid antiandrogens that interfere with androgen synthesis, such as abiraterone, and to differ from current standard of care treatment options, such as darolutamide, enzalutamide, or apalutamide, that bind only to the LBD of the AR, which may explain their reduced efficacy in patients with AR-SV-expressing tumors, as these AR variants lack the certain parts of the LBD. We believe that the potentially differentiated dual-action pharmacology of ONCT-534 has the potential to translate into significantly improved clinical outcomes over current standard of care agents.
 We believe our mechanism of action offers potential for DAARI therapeutic development in other AR-driven diseases, such as luminal AR-positive triple-negative breast cancer, or LAR-TNBC, as well as non-oncology indications, such as Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy, or SBMA.

ONCT-534 development in prostate cancer
We are evaluating ONCT-534 as a potential therapy for patients with advanced CRPC and other AR-driven diseases.
In preclinical studies, ONCT-534 demonstrated antagonism and degradation of full-length AR, mutant LBD AR, and AR-splice variants. ONCT-534 additionally has shown strong in vivo activity in models of prostate cancer in both castrated and intact animals that are resistant to AR antagonists, such as enzalutamide, as detailed below.
To assess the ability of ONCT-534 to treat enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancers, we conducted in vivo studies in an enzalutamide-resistant MDVR VCaP cell line xenograft model. This treatment resistance can be seen below for both castrated and intact animals (Figures 11 and 12), as tumors in mice dosed with enzalutamide grew at nearly the same rate as tumors in mice dosed only with the drug vehicle, a control similar to dosing with a placebo. Orally delivered ONCT-534 substantially inhibited tumor growth, described as tumor growth inhibition, or TGI, in these enzalutamide-resistant MDVR tumors.


Figure 11. DAARIs Exhibited AR-specific Anti-tumor Activity in ENZA-resistant CRPC Preclinical Model
 

   

In a mouse xenograft model of human prostate cancer in intact animals, tumor growth of LnCAP human prostate cancer cells that overexpress AR (LnCAP-AR) was significantly inhibited by treatment with ONCT-534, as shown in the figure below.

Figure 12. DAARIs Exhibited AR-specific Anti-tumor Activity in AR-overexpressing Preclinical Model
 


AR-V7 is a splice variant of AR that lacks the LBD and hinge region and is expressed in 22Rv1 cells, which are human prostate carcinoma epithelial cells derived from a xenograft that was serially propagated in mice after castration-induced regression and relapse of the parental, androgen-dependent xenograft. As shown in Figure 13 below, enzalutamide is not efficacious against these tumors that lack the LBD. Treatment with ONCT-534 however, resulted in tumor growth inhibition as well as significant reduction in PSA in this model, demonstrating activity at the NTD.


Figure 13. DAARIs Exhibited Anti-tumor Activity in AR Splice-variant Preclinical Model

Preclinical IND-enabling activities are ongoing for ONCT-534. We are also evaluating potential Phase 1/2 clinical trial designs to evaluate safety, determine the RP2D and evaluate efficacy, including the effect on patient PSA levels of ONCT-534 in patients with relapsed or refractory mCRPC regardless of their mutational status.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technology evolution. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as government, academic and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs. Our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize similar products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop.
In particular, we compete with other companies that are developing and commercializing treatments for patients with cancer. Competing therapies include chemotherapies, targeted therapies and immunotherapies and may represent various therapeutic modalities including small molecules, antibodies, cell therapies, gene therapies, and cancer vaccines. These companies may compete with us for clinical trial sites and eligible patient populations, scientific and management talent, outsourced manufacturing capacity and healthcare budgets for commercial-stage products.
Zilovertamab
There are several therapeutic options available to treat patients with relapsed or refractory MCL, including BTK inhibitors such as: (i) ibrutinib (Imbruvica), was initially FDA approved in 2013 and is marketed by AbbVie, Inc., or AbbVie and Johnson and Johnson, (ii) acalabrutinib (Calquence), was initially FDA approved in 2017 and is marketed by AstraZeneca PLC, or AstraZeneca, and (iii) zanubrutinib (Brukinsa), was initially FDA approved in 2019 and is marketed by BeiGene USA, Inc., or BeiGene. These therapies are given continuously for prolonged periods of time, and their use can be associated with significant toxicity. The majority of patients with MCL are older, and remissions are not durable with most patients relapsing in less than 20 months. There are therapeutic treatments approved for patients who progress after systemic therapy with a BTK inhibitor, including pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca), a non-covalent BTK inhibitor FDA approved in 2022 for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory MCL after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor. We believe that more effective and better tolerated therapies represent a significant unmet need.
Three classes of targeted therapies have been approved for the treatment of patients with CLL: (i) BTK inhibitors, a key component of cell signaling in B-cells, such as ibrutinib (Imbruvica) is marketed by AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson; acalabrutinib (Calquence) is marketed by AstraZeneca, and zanubrutinib (Brukinsa) is marketed by BeiGene; (ii) inhibitors of the protein B-cell lymphoma-2, or Bcl-2, such as venetoclax (Venclexta and Venclyxto) is marketed by AbbVie and Roche/Genentech; and (iii) inhibitors of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase, or PI3K, which include idelalisib, which is marketed as Zydelig by Gilead Sciences, Inc., and duvelisib, which is marketed as

Copiktra by Verastem, Inc. These targeted therapies are now the core of the recommended treatment regimens for patients with both first-line and relapsed or refractory CLL.
 While there are currently no approved products targeting the ROR1 receptor, we are aware of therapeutics in clinical development that target ROR1, including MK-2140, an ADC being developed by Merck, an ADC being developed by NBE-Therapeutics (acquired by Boehringer Ingelheim in 2020), and a ROR1 CAR T therapy being developed by Lyell Immunopharma, Inc. MK-2140, originally designed and developed by Oncternal, binds to the same epitope on ROR1, and utilizes zilovertamab to target ROR1.
There are numerous companies developing or marketing treatments for the same oncology indications that we are targeting with our zilovertamab program. Therapies approved or in clinical development for the treatment of patients with treatment-naïve or relapsed/refractory CLL and relapsed/refractory MCL include BTK inhibitors, Bcl-2 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, anti-CD20 antibodies, and cell therapies that are being marketed or developed by companies including AbbVie, AstraZeneca, BeiGene, Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, MEI Pharma, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Roche Holding AG’s Genentech subsidiary, TG Therapeutics, Inc., and Verastem, Inc.
 ROR1 CAR T
 While there are currently no approved cell therapy products targeting the ROR1 receptor, we are aware of an autologous CAR T cell therapy clinical program targeting ROR1 sponsored by Lyell Immunopharma, Inc. for patients with solid tumors. Precigen, Inc. announced plans to initiate a Phase 1/1b clinical trial of PRGN-3007, an autologous CAR T cell therapy targeting ROR1, in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Caribou Biosciences, Inc. announced plans to develop an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived allogeneic anti-ROR1 CAR-NK cell therapy.
 
There are numerous companies developing or marketing cell therapy treatments for the same oncology indications that we may target with our ROR1 CAR T program including AbbVie, Adicet, Allogene Therapeutics, Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Bluebird Bio, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Caribou Therapeutics, Fate Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Legend Biotech, Merck, NantKwest, Nkarta Therapeutics, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Poseida Therapeutics, Roche Holding AG, and others. Six CAR T cell therapies have been approved by the FDA, Yescarta and Tecartus are marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., Kymriah is marketed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Abcema and Breyanzi are marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Carvykti, marketed by Johnson and Johnson. Yescarta, Tecartus, Kymriah and Breyanzi target the CD19 protein, a protein expressed on the surface of the majority of B cells, including B cell tumorigenic cells.
 ONCT-534
 While there are currently no approved drugs with similar mechanism of action as our DAARI program, ONCT-534, the competition in the advanced prostate cancer market is very high. Several therapies have already been approved and many more are currently in development. Second-generation antiandrogens including Xtandi (Astellas and Pfizer), Zytiga/Erleada (Johnson & Johnson), and Nubeqa (Bayer) have become the preferred regimens for first line therapy in this indication. Other therapeutic modalities, such as checkpoint inhibitors are being evaluated in combination with either antiandrogen or chemotherapies. Bispecific antibodies and CAR T therapies targeted towards prostate-specific member antigen are also in early development. Other approaches to interfering with AR signaling include strategies to: (i) blocking AR activation via NTD binding as being pursued by ESSA Pharma, Inc., and (ii) degrading the AR protein such as that being pursued by Arvinas, Inc.
 Licenses and Collaborative Relationships
 UC San Diego
 In March 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, represented by UC San Diego, which was amended and restated in August 2018, and amended thereafter (the “Regents License Agreement”), for the development, manufacturing and distribution rights to naked antibodies, including zilovertamab and genetically engineered cellular therapy products, including CAR T products that are covered by licensed patents for all human therapeutic, diagnostic and preventive applications in all indications. The

Regents License Agreement requires us to pay certain development and regulatory milestones aggregating from $20.1 million to $24.5 million, on a per product basis, certain worldwide sales milestones based on achievement of tiered revenue levels aggregating $75.0 million, low single-digit royalties including potential future minimum annual royalties on net sales of each product, certain annual patent costs, and annual license maintenance fees. Unless terminated earlier, the Regents License Agreement will expire upon the later of the expiration date of the longest-lived patent rights or the 15th anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product.
UC San Diego may terminate the Regents License Agreement if a material breach by us is not cured within a reasonable time, we file a claim asserting the licensed patent rights are invalid or unenforceable, or we file for bankruptcy. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 60 days’ written notice.
In July 2016, and as modified by the amended and restated Regents License Agreement in August 2018, we entered into a research agreement with the Regents for research on the ROR1 therapeutic development program. Under this five-year agreement that expired in June 2021, UC San Diego was paid an aggregate of $3.6 million. Effective January 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Research Agreement (the “Research Agreement”) with the Regents for further research on the ROR1 therapeutic development program. Under this four-year agreement that expires on December 31, 2025, the Regents will receive payments aggregating $1.6 million, with quarterly payments of $125,000 in 2022, $131,250 in 2023, and $137,813 in 2024. Such costs are includable as part of the Company’s annual diligence obligations under the Regents License Agreement.
 CIRM
 In August 2017, and as amended and restated in December 2020, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM, awarded an $18.3 million grant to researchers at UC San Diego to advance the Study CIRM-0001. The Company: (i) is conducting this study in collaboration with UC San Diego, (ii) received $14.5 million in development milestones under research subaward agreements during the award project period from October 1, 2017 through March 31, 2022, (iii) was committed to certain co-funding requirements, and (iv) was required to provide UC San Diego progress and financial update reports throughout the award period. The subaward does not bear a royalty payment commitment, nor is the subaward otherwise refundable. As of December 31, 2022, we believe we have met and completed our obligations under the CIRM award and UC San Diego subawards.
Celularity
 In September 2021, we entered into a research collaboration with Celularity to evaluate placental derived-cellular therapies targeting ROR1. Under the collaboration, Celularity explored in preclinical studies: (i) the use of zilovertamab in combination with Celularity’s NK cells, or CYNK-101, a placental derived-allogeneic NK cell therapy that has been genetically engineered to synergize with therapeutic antibodies, and (ii) ROR1-targeted CAR gene modification in Celularity’s CYNK natural killer cell and CyCART T cell platforms. As of December 31, 2022, we believe we have met all of our obligations hereunder.
Georgetown University
 In March 2014, we entered into an exclusive license agreement, or the Georgetown License Agreement, with Georgetown University, or Georgetown, pursuant to which we licensed the exclusive worldwide right to patents and technologies for the development and commercialization of certain product candidates targeting EWS-FLI1 as an anti-tumor therapy for therapeutic, diagnostics, or research tool purposes. Under the Georgetown License Agreement, we are solely responsible for all development and commercialization activities and costs in our respective territories and are also responsible for all costs related to the filing, prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patent rights. We are also obligated to pay Georgetown an annual license maintenance fee until the first commercial sale occurs, make up to $0.2 million in aggregate milestone payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones, and will be required to pay low single digit royalties based on annual net product sales. The term of the Georgetown License Agreement continues until the expiration of the last valid claim within the patent rights covering the product but may be terminated by either party upon material breach, or by us as to one or more countries with 90 days written notice of termination. Additionally, Georgetown may terminate the agreement in the event we fail to pay any amount and fails to cure such failure within 30 days after receipt of notice, default in our

obligation to obtain and maintain insurance and fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after receipt of notice or declare insolvency or bankruptcy. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 60 days’ written notice. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had not triggered or made any milestone payments under the Georgetown License Agreement.
 Shanghai Pharmaceutical (USA) Inc. (“SPH USA”)
 In November 2018, and as amended in August 2020, we entered into a license agreement with SPH USA, or the SPH USA License Agreement, under which we granted exclusive rights to SPH USA to manufacture, develop, market, distribute and sell in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan (the “SPH USA Territory” or "Greater China"), our product candidates under the Georgetown License Agreement and the UC San Diego License Agreement. Under the License and Development Agreement, or LDA, SPH USA is solely responsible for: (a) all preclinical and clinical development activities required in order to obtain regulatory approval in Greater China for such product candidates, (b) any third-party license milestone or royalty payments owed under the Georgetown License Agreement and the Regents License Agreement, and (c) paying the Company a low single digit royalty on net sales in the territory. The SPH USA License Agreement will expire on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country/region-by-country/region basis on the later of ten years from the date of first commercial sale or when there is no longer a valid patent claim covering such licensed product in such country/region.
The SPH USA License Agreement may be terminated by SPH USA, on a country/region-by-country/region or product-by-product basis with 180 days written notice following the first anniversary of the effective date of the agreement or at any time on a product-by-product basis for a safety concern with respect to such product. Either party may terminate the SPH USA License Agreement in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis upon material breach that is not cured within 90 days, or in its entirety the event the other party becomes insolvent or enters into bankruptcy proceedings. We may terminate the agreement with 60 days written notice if SPH USA or its affiliates or sublicensees commence an action challenging the validity or enforceability of any licensed patent, or with 10 days written notice if SPH USA fails to own at least 20% of the voting securities of any assignee of the SPH USA License Agreement. Upon termination of the agreement for any reason all rights and licenses granted to SPH USA under the agreement will terminate, and in the event of termination for reasons other than our material breach, SPH USA would grant us non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to any intellectual property rights controlled by SPH USA or its affiliates to exploit the terminated program in the SPH USA Territory.
 University of Tennessee Research Foundation (“UTRF”)
 In March 2015, and as amended and restated in March 2022 and August 2022, we entered into a license agreement with UTRF (the “DAARI License Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company was granted exclusive worldwide rights in all existing DAARI technologies owned or controlled by UTRF, including all improvements thereto. Under the DAARI License Agreement, the Company is obligated to employ active, diligent efforts to conduct preclinical research and development activities for the DAARI program to advance one or more lead compounds into clinical development. We are obligated to pay UTRF annual license maintenance fees in the mid five digits and low single-digit royalties on aggregate net sales of licensed products. We are also obligated to pay UTRF tiered royalties ranging from a low single digit to low double digit percentage of consideration received by our sublicensees, excluding royalties, such percentage dependent on the stage of development of a clinical product candidate at the time it is sublicensed. Our obligation to pay UTRF royalties expires on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis on the last-to-expire valid patent claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product in such country. As of December 31, 2022, the Company believes it has met its obligations under the DAARI License Agreement.
 Unless terminated earlier, the term of the DAARI License Agreement will continue, on a country-by-country basis, until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of any licensed patent covering a licensed product in such country. Either party may terminate the DAARI License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, subject to certain notice and cure periods. UTRF may terminate the DAARI License Agreement for our bankruptcy or insolvency. We may terminate the Amended and Restated UTRF Agreement with advance written notice to UTRF, provided we have satisfied our payment obligations to UTRF prior to such termination.


Manufacturing
 We have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with third parties to manufacture API, drug substance and drug product in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, and additional manufacturers are used to label, package and distribute investigational drug products. This strategy allows us to maintain a more flexible infrastructure while focusing our expertise on the development of our products.
 We expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production, characterization, and release testing of clinical and commercial quantities of all product candidates and associated reagents. For example, we are working with Lentigen on lentivirus manufacturing, Miltenyi on cell processing, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute on cGMP cell preparation and manufacturing activities for use in first-in-human studies of our ROR1-targeting CAR T cell therapy candidate ONCT-808. There are no unusually complicated biochemistries or equipment required in the manufacturing process for zilovertamab, ONCT-808 or ONCT-534, which we believe allows for potential manufacturing flexibility and cost and vein to vein time efficiencies.
 We have established a quality control and quality assurance program, which includes a set of standard operating procedures and specifications designed to ensure that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMPs, and other applicable domestic and foreign regulations.
 Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or acquired or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the U.S and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, continuing innovation, and acquisition and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of cancer therapeutics.
 Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to: (i) obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements, (ii) preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, (iii) defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents, and (iv) operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 We have developed, licensed and acquired numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of healthcare products and services. As of February 4, 2023, our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio consisted of approximately 46 issued U.S. patents and 26 pending U.S. patent applications related to certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements, and 90 issued patents and 131 pending patent applications in jurisdictions outside of the U.S.
 ROR1 Program
 We have an exclusive, commercial, worldwide, transferrable license to a portfolio of patents and patent applications directed to ROR1 antibodies and CAR T therapies for all therapeutic indications. This portfolio is licensed from the Regents of the University of California. We have know-how and trade secrets related to compositions of matter for treating cancers, methods for treating cancer, and methods of screening for additional compositions of matter used for treating cancer, as well as to additional antibodies and molecules that modulate ROR1 signaling. We have also developed certain patents and patent applications directed to ROR1 based therapies, which are owned by Oncternal.
 As of February 4, 2023, our licensed patent portfolio included patents related to our zilovertamab clinical candidate currently in Phase 1/2 and Phase 3 clinical trials. Zilovertamab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the ROR1 receptor. We have two issued U.S. patents directed to the zilovertamab composition of matter: U.S. Pat. No. 9,217,040, with a patent term not due to expire before 2032; and U.S. Patent No. 9,758,591, with a patent term not due to expire before March 2033. We have one patent issued in the U.S. directed to methods

of using zilovertamab to treat cancer, U.S. Pat, No. 10,344,096, with a patent term not due to expire before March 2033. We have one issued patent in the U.S. related to single chain variable region fragments derived from zilovertamab with a patent term not due to expire before March 2033. We also have patents issued in Australia, China, Europe, Israel, Japan, Korea, Macao, Canada, Brazil, India, Philippines, Malaysia and Mexico directed to zilovertamab compositions of matter. In Europe patents directed to zilovertamab compositions of matter have been validated in jurisdictions including France, Germany, Italy, UK, Spain, Turkey, Belgium, Poland, Netherlands, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, and Ireland. We have applications pending in foreign jurisdictions related to zilovertamab compositions of matter and methods of use in treating cancer, including Australia, China, Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Thailand. Patents, if issued from these pending foreign applications, would not be due to expire before 2033. The validity of one of our issued European patents EP Patent No. 3604339 is being challenged in an opposition proceeding. This patent is directed to methods of treating cancer using antibodies that bind to the epitope bound by zilovertamab. We believe we have meritorious defenses against the opposition.
As of February 4, 2023, we have approximately 31 licensed patent applications pending in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside the U.S. related to methods of treating cancer using a combination of zilovertamab and small-molecule chemotherapeutics.

We additionally have one issued U.S. patent and patent applications issued in Japan and Australia directed to methods of screening for modulators of ROR1 signaling; additionally, we have applications pending in the U.S., Canada, China, Hong Kong, and Europe directed to methods of screening for modulators of ROR1 signaling.
 As of February 4, 2023, we also own one patent application filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty directed to methods of treating cancer using a combination of zilovertamab and small molecule cancer chemotherapeutics.
DAARI Program
 We have exclusive worldwide rights to a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to Dual-Action Androgen Receptor Inhibitor, or DAARI, compounds for use in therapeutics. We hold a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to DAARIs and jointly owned with UTRF, including eleven issued U.S. patents directed to DAARI ligands and methods of use thereof: U.S. Pat. No. 9,814,698, U.S. Pat. No. 10,017,471, U.S. Pat. No. 10,035,763, U.S. Pat. No. 10,441,570, U.S. Pat. No. 10,865,184, U.S. Pat. No. 9,815,776, U.S. Pat. No. 9,834,507,

U.S. Pat. No. 10,093,613, U.S. Pat. No. 10,597,354, U.S. Pat. No. 10,806,720, and U.S. Pat. No. 11,73,147 as well as seven issued patents in Australia, Japan, China, Europe (validated in Great Britain, France and Germany), India, and Russia, and four pending U.S. patent applications and six pending patent applications outside of the U.S., each with a patent term not due to expire before April 2036. We also have a portfolio of patents and patent applications licensed from UTRF including five issued U.S. patent directed to DAARI ligands and methods of use thereof: U.S. Pat. No. 10,314,797, U.S. Pat. No. 10,654,809, U.S. Pat. No. 10,806,719, U.S. Pat. No. 11,230,523, and U.S. Pat. No. 11,230,531, five issued patents in Australia, Japan Israel, Korea, and Mexico, two pending U.S. patent applications and thirteen patent applications outside of the U.S., each with a potential patent term not due to expire before June 2037. A third portfolio for the DAARI program includes approximately forty-seven patent applications licensed from UTRF including eight pending patent applications in the U.S. and thirty-nine pending patent applications outside of the U.S.
Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the U.S. are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective and non-provisional filing date. The patent term may be adjusted to compensate for delayed patent issuance when such delays are caused by the patent office or successful appeals against patent office actions. There is no limit on this patent term adjustment. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The extended restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following the date of FDA approval of the applicable drug product. The duration of patents outside of the U.S. varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. Our issued patents are due to expire on dates ranging from 2036-2037. If patents are issued on our pending patent applications, the resulting patents would be due to expire on dates ranging from 2036-2042. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent. Most countries require a patent owner to pay maintenance fees or annuities in order to extend the patent to the full length of its term. If these fees and annuities are not paid timely, our patents will expire prior to the expiration date.
 ONCT-216 Program
 We have exclusive worldwide rights to a portfolio of patents and patent applications related to small molecules, including ONCT-216, targeting EWS-FLI1 for use in therapeutics and companion diagnostics.

 Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local levels, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process and a new biologic must be approved by the FDA through the BLA process before it may be legally marketed in the U.S. There are similar processes required for marketing authorization in other countries. For all European Union (EU) countries, marketing authorization for biologics and any product to treat patients with cancer is evaluated and granted on a pan-EU basis.
United States Drug Development Process
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. We, along with third-party contractors, are required to navigate the various nonclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements and guidance. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

The following steps are usually required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the U.S.:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with GLP requirements and other applicable regulations; submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or Ethics Committee associated with each clinical site before patients can be enrolled into each trial at that particular clinical site;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic, for its intended use;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA after substantial information is available from pivotal clinical trials;
 •a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA whether to file the application for review;
 •potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug or biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and audits of selected clinical trial sites to ensure compliance with GCP; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
 Preclinical studies usually include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the U.S., a Sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The U.S. IND submission contains the general investigational plan, the clinical protocol, protocols and results from preclinical studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information, and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. The FDA will review the IND, and if the information is adequate, the IND goes into effect and human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically goes into effect 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA requires additional information which may result in a clinical hold if the data are insufficient. In such a case, the IND Sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on any drug or biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, one or more trials may not recommence or continue without FDA authorization associated with agreed terms or changes agreed between the FDA and Sponsor.
 In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA, supervision of certain human gene transfer trials may also require evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to the public health or the environment, and such assessment may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial.
Clinical trials involve the administration of a product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study Sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, patient selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor patient safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical study will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations including GCP requirements, including the

requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. The FDA, the IRBs, or the Sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if a trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the Sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1: The product candidate is initially administered to healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine the appropriate dosage for further clinical trials.
 •Phase 3: The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and the overall risk benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling and commercial use of the product.
 Postmarketing requirements and commitments refer to studies and clinical trials that a Sponsor conducts after FDA approval to gather additional information about a product’s safety, efficacy, or optimal use. Some of the studies and clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be required under one or more statutes and regulations; others may be studies or clinical trials a Sponsor has committed to conduct. Postmarketing commitments are studies or clinical trials that a Sponsor has agreed to conduct, but that are not required by a statute or regulation.
 During the development of a new drug or biologic, Sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These meetings may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 1 or 2, and before an NDA or BLA is submitted, or at other times important in product candidate development. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the Sponsor to share information about the clinical, preclinical or CMC data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the Sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) that they believe will support approval of the new drug or biologic.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, Sponsors usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA‑regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial

is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved.
 United States Review and Approval Process
 The results of product development, preclinical and other preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. The NDA or BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s CMC and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of the product, or from several alternative sources, including studies initiated and sponsored by investigators. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances (eg., indication for a product with orphan drug designation or small business submitting its first NDA).
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA will determine the type of review (standard or priority) and the FDA begins an in depth substantive review. The FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an FDA advisory committee so that independent advice can be provided to contribute to the FDA’s decision-making and lends credibility to the review process. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an FDA advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities follow cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA or BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, it will issue an Approval Letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An Approval Letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug and is accompanied with the approved U.S. Prescribing Information, or USPI. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the NDA or BLA is complete and the application will not be approved with the information provided by the Sponsor. A CRL usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional clinical trial or other significant and time‑consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies, or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the Sponsor must resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the CRL Since the re-submission of the NDA and BLA may address all deficiencies, there is no guarantee that the FDA would approve the NDA or BLA as the circumstances may have changed.

If a product receives FDA approval for marketing authorization, the approval may be significantly limited to a specific disease subset, dosages, or use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to require post-marketing information including additional information from certain trials, perform Phase 4 clinical trials designed to further assess a products safety and effectiveness after NDA or BLA approval, may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized, additional CMC information or preclinical studies. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the Sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS program. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS program, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non‑compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 The FDA Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, made permanent the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, which requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the Sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biologic product available in the U.S. for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug or biologic also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user‑fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity.

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers several expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new

drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs or biologics are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the disease or condition. An unmet medical need is a condition whose treatment or diagnosis is not addressed adequately by available therapy. The Sponsor of a Fast Track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent meetings with the FDA review team during product development and, once an NDA or BLA is submitted, the product may be eligible for priority review. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. With regard to a Fast Track product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA or BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the Sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA or BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA or BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the Sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA.
 
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation (BTD) to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive BTD if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any product candidate submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and Accelerated Approval. A BLA or NDA for a product candidate is eligible for priority review if the product candidate has the potential to provide a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious disease or condition compared to marketed products. A serious disease or condition is a disease or condition associated with morbidity that has a substantial impact on day-to-day functioning. Short-lived and self-limiting morbidity will usually not be sufficient, but the morbidity need not be irreversible if it is persistent or recurrent. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of a BLA or NDA designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of original BLAs and new molecular entity NDAs under its standard review goals.
 In addition, a product candidate may be eligible for Accelerated Approval. Drugs and biologics intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for Accelerated Approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint, is a marker such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure, that is thought to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a Sponsor of a drug receiving Accelerated Approval perform adequate and well-controlled postmarketing confirmation clinical trials. As a condition of Accelerated Approval, the FDA will generally require the Sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products approval using the Accelerated Approval pathway may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the Sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for Accelerated Approval preapproval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the commercial launch of the product.

In 2017, the FDA established the regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation as part of its implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation program is intended to fulfill the 21st Century Cures Act requirement that the FDA facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of, any drug or biologic. Regenerative medicine therapies to treat, modify, reverse, or cure serious conditions are eligible for FDA’s expedited programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation, Accelerated Approval, and priority review designation, if they meet the criteria for such programs. that meets the following criteria: (i) the drug or biologic qualifies as a RMAT, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such

therapies or products, with limited exceptions; (ii) the drug or biologic is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (iii) preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition.
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, RMAT designation, priority review and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 
In 2012, the U.S. Congress authorized the FDA to award priority review vouchers to Sponsors of certain rare pediatric disease product applications. This program is designed to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Specifically, under this program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biologic for a “rare pediatric disease” may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive priority review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The Sponsor of a rare pediatric disease drug product receiving a priority review voucher may transfer (including by sale) the voucher to another sponsor. The voucher may be further transferred any number of times before the voucher is used, as long as the Sponsor making the transfer has not yet submitted the application. The FDA may also revoke any priority review voucher if the rare pediatric disease drug for which the voucher was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within one year following the date of approval.
 
For purposes of this program, a “rare pediatric disease” is a (a) serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents; and (b) rare diseases or conditions within the meaning of the Orphan Drug Act. On December 27, 2020, the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program was extended. Under the current statutory sunset provisions, after September 30, 2024, FDA may only award a voucher for an approved rare pediatric disease product application if the Sponsor has rare pediatric disease designation for the drug, and that designation was granted by September 30, 2024. After September 30, 2026, FDA may not award any Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher.
 Post‑approval requirements
 Once an approval of marketing authorization is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug and biologics manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 Any drug products we or our partners manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA marketing authorization approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, irrespective of the country of manufacture, including, among other things, recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market and imposes requirements and restrictions on drug and biologics manufacturers, such as those

related to direct to consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and consistent with the provisions of the approved label. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications about off-label use of their products.
Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties.
Drug Product Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions authorized under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. For example, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder.
 The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to any preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the Sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances.
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Affordable Care Act includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or

interchangeable with an FDA licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway that are still being addressed by the FDA.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the Sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics

Our product candidates may require use of an in vitro diagnostic to identify appropriate patient populations. These diagnostics, often referred to as companion diagnostics, are regulated as medical devices. In the U.S., the FDCA and its implementing regulations, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution, export and import, and post-market surveillance. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostic tests require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval, or PMA, approval.

If use of companion diagnostic is essential to safe and effective use of a drug or biologic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic contemporaneously with the approval of the therapeutic product. On August 6, 2014, the FDA issued a final guidance document addressing the development and approval process for “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.” According to the guidance, for novel candidates such as our product candidates, a companion diagnostic device and its corresponding drug or biologic candidate should be approved or cleared contemporaneously by FDA for the use indicated in the therapeutic product labeling. The guidance also explains that a companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational device, unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. Thus, the Sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same investigational study, if the study meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the study plan and subjects, a sponsor may seek to submit an IND alone, or both an IND and an IDE. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance document intended to further assist sponsors of therapeutic products and sponsors of in vitro companion diagnostic devices on issues related to co-development of these products.


The FDA generally requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain approval of a PMA for that diagnostic contemporaneously with approval of the therapeutic. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of therapeutic candidates such as those we are developing involves coordination of review by the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and preclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications are also subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for certain devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. In addition, as part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.

If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter, which usually contains several conditions that must be met in order to secure the final approval of the PMA, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.

If the FDA’s evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. A not approvable letter will outline the deficiencies in the application and, where practical, will identify what is necessary to make the PMA approvable. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and then the data submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Once granted, PMA approval may be withdrawn by the FDA if compliance with post approval requirements, conditions of approval or other regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing. PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval.
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
 Approval Process Outside of the United States
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, post-marketing requirements and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. In addition, ethical, social, and legal concerns about gene-editing technology, gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may want to use.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product

candidates in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution.
 
Regulations Governing Marketing Authorization of Medicinal Products in the European Union
Preclinical studies and clinical trials
 
Similarly to the U.S., the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union, or EU, are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 Preclinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of GLP as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for preclinical studies.
 The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation, or CTR, which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. The CTR foresees a three-year transition period. The extent to which ongoing and new clinical trials will be governed by the CTR varies. For clinical trials whose Clinical Trial Application, or CTA, was made under the Clinical Trials Directive before January 31, 2022, the Clinical Trials Directive will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. Additionally, Sponsors may still choose to submit a CTA under either the Clinical Trials Directive or the CTR until January 31, 2023 and, if authorized, those will be governed by the Clinical Trials Directive until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR.
Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database.
While the Clinical Trials Directive required a separate CTA to be submitted in each member state, to both the competent national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB respectively, the CTR introduces a centralized process and only requires the submission of a single application to all member states concerned. The CTR allows sponsors to make a single submission to both the competent authority and an ethics committee in each member state, leading to a single decision per member state. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier, or IMPD, containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. The assessment procedure of the CTA has been harmonized as well, including a joint assessment by all member states concerned, and a separate assessment by each member state with respect to specific requirements related to its own territory, including ethics rules. Each member state’s decision is communicated to the Sponsor via the centralized EU portal. Once the CTA is approved, clinical study development may proceed.

Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Marketing Authorization
 
In the EU, to obtain regulatory approval of an investigational chemical or biological product under EU regulatory systems, a marketing authorization application, or MAA, must be submitted. Medicinal product candidates can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization, or MA. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.

“Centralized MAs” are issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medical Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and are valid throughout the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain types of medicinal medicines, such as: (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii)

medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines, and (iv) Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products, or ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. It is very likely that the centralized procedure would apply to the products we are developing.

The Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the CHMP for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CAT is primarily responsible for the scientific evaluation of ATMPs and prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of each ATMP for which a MAA is submitted. The CAT’s opinion is then taken into account by the CHMP when giving its final recommendation regarding the authorization of a product in view of the balance of benefits and risks identified. Although the CAT’s draft opinion is submitted to the CHMP for final approval, the CHMP may depart from the draft opinion, if it provides detailed scientific justification. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs and have published numerous guidelines, including specific guidelines on gene therapies and cell therapies. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs; the manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a marketing authorization application; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long-term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs.
 
Under the centralized procedure and in exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme, a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment, but this is not guaranteed. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.

Moreover, in the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and must be renewed annually until fulfillment of all the conditions. Once the pending studies are provided, it can become a “standard” MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA, the MA ceases to be renewed. Furthermore, MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” when the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. This may arise when the intended indications are very rare and, in the present state of scientific knowledge, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. This MA is close to the conditional MA as it is reserved to medicinal products to be approved for severe diseases or unmet medical needs and the applicant does not hold the complete data set legally required for the grant of a MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, the applicant does not have to provide the missing data and will never have to. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually and the MA is withdrawn in case the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.
 
MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.


Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 
The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving MA, reference medicinal products generally qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic/biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic/biosimilar product can be marketed until 10 years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those 10 years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical/biological entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
Orphan Medicinal Products
 The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the U.S. A medicinal product may be designated as orphan if its Sponsor can establish that: (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition, (2) either: (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment, and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.
The application for orphan drug designation must be submitted before the application for MA. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and access to the centralized procedure. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. During the ten-year market exclusivity period, the competent authorities cannot accept a MAA, or grant a MA, or accept an application to extend a MA, for the same indication, in respect of a similar medicinal product. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the MAA is submitted. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed pediatric investigation plan, or PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The 10‑year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity, or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. In addition, MA may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if (1) the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (2) the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (3) the applicant cannot supply enough quantities of the orphan medicinal product. A company may voluntarily remove a product from the orphan register.
 
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 
Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production,

distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 
Regulation of Companion Diagnostics in the EU
 In the EU, in vitro diagnostic medical devices are regulated by Directive 98/79/EC, or IVDD, which regulates the placing on the market, the CE marking, the essential requirements, the conformity assessment procedures, the registration obligations for manufactures and devices as well as the vigilance procedure. In vitro diagnostic medical devices must comply with the requirements provided for in the Directive, and with further requirements implemented at national level (as the case may be).

The regulation of companion diagnostics is subject to further requirements since the in-vitro diagnostic medical devices Regulation No 2017/746, or IVDR, became effective on May 26, 2022. The IVDR will fully apply on May 26, 2022, but there will be a tiered system extending the grace period for many devices (depending on their risk classification) before they have to be fully compliant with the regulation.
 
The IVDR introduces a new classification system for companion diagnostics which are now specifically defined as diagnostic tests that support the safe and effective use of a specific medicinal product, by identifying patients that are suitable or unsuitable for treatment. Companion diagnostics will have to undergo a conformity assessment by a notified body. Before it can issue a CE certificate, the notified body must seek a scientific opinion from the EMA on the suitability of the companion to the medicinal product concerned if the medicinal product falls exclusively within the scope of the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicines, or the medicinal product is already authorized through the centralized procedure, or a MAA for the medicinal product has been submitted through the centralized procedure. For other substances, the notified body can seek the opinion from a national competent authorities or the EMA.
 
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
 
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
 The United Kingdom, or UK, left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. The transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the UK and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, and became effective on the January 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations.

EU laws which have been transposed into UK law through secondary legislation continue to be applicable as “retained EU law”. However, new legislation such as the EU CTR will not be applicable. The UK government has passed a new Medicines and Medical Devices Act 2021, which introduces delegated powers in favor of the Secretary of State or an ‘appropriate authority’ to amend or supplement existing regulations in the area of medicinal products and medical devices. This allows new rules to be introduced in the future by way of secondary legislation, which aims to allow flexibility in addressing regulatory gaps and future changes in the fields of human medicines, clinical trials and medical devices.
 As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales, and Scotland, together, Great Britain, or GB; broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. The MHRA has published a guidance on how various aspects of the UK regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, importing, exporting, and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development, or commercialization of medicines in the UK. The new guidance

was given effect via the Human Medicines Regulations (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, or the Exit Regulations.
The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, including a 150-day assessment and a rolling review procedure. All existing EU MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically converted or grandfathered into UK MAs, effective in GB (only), free of charge on January 1, 2021, unless the MA holder chooses to opt-out. In order to use the centralized procedure to obtain a MA that will be valid throughout the EEA, companies must be established in the EEA. Therefore, after Brexit, companies established in the UK can no longer use the EU centralized procedure and instead an EEA entity must hold any centralized MAs. In order to obtain a UK MA to commercialize products in the UK, an applicant must be established in the UK and must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures or one of the remaining post-Brexit international cooperation procedures. The MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new (centralized procedure) MA when determining an application for a GB authorization; or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable MAs approved in EU member states (or Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) to be granted in GB.
 Other Foreign Regulations Governing Marketing Authorization of Medicinal Products
 For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the U.S. federal and state governments and by authorities in the foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. Violation of these laws or other governmental regulations may result in penalties, including, without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, disgorgement, imprisonment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical or biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the U.S., and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that may require companies to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. Lastly, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for

their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic (or biosimilar) products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical or biological products, medical devices and medical services, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
Healthcare Reform
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted several reform proposals to change the healthcare system. There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by federal and state legislative initiatives, including those designed to limit the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the U.S., and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions of particular importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including, but not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, Congressional, and executive branch challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020, through March 31, 2022, and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the way manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area, or EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust

regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and the United Kingdom GDPR, or UK GDPR, which, together with the amended United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in United Kingdom, or UK, national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Human Capital
 As of March 3, 2023, we had 30 full-time employees, two part-time employees, and several consultants, most of whom are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
 Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our management team and our clinical, scientific, and other employees and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, to align our interests and the interests of our stockholders with those of our employees and consultants.
 Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters are in San Diego, California, where we currently sublease 3,748 square feet of office space available for corporate, research, development, clinical, regulatory, manufacturing and quality functions.
Corporate Information and Merger
We were incorporated under the name Genotherapeutics, Inc. in Tennessee in September 1997. We changed our name to GTx, Inc. in 2001 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2003. On March 6, 2019, we, then operating as GTx, Inc., or GTx, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, as amended, or the Merger Agreement, with privately-held Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc., or Private Oncternal, and Grizzly Merger Sub, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub. Under the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Private Oncternal, with Private Oncternal surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). On June 7, 2019, the Merger was completed.
