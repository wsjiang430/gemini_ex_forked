Item 1. Business
General
ADA-ES, Inc. ("ADA"), a Colorado corporation, was incorporated in 1997. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, effective July 1, 2013, Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc. ("ADES"), a Delaware company incorporated in 2011, succeeded ADA as the publicly-held corporation and ADA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADES. In 2018, we acquired ADA Carbon Solutions, LLC ("Carbon Solutions") as a means to enter into the broader activated carbon ("AC") market and to expand our product offerings in the mercury control industry and other applicable AC markets. In February 2023, we acquired the subsidiaries of Arq Limited (hereafter the Arq Limited subsidiaries referred to as "Arq") to secure access to a unique feedstock, a manufacturing facility and certain patented processes as a means to further expand our product offerings. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is referred to as the "Form 10-K" or the "Report." As used in this Report, the terms the "Company," "we," "us" and "our" means ADES and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
We sell consumable products that utilize AC and chemical-based technologies to a broad range of customers, including coal-fired utilities, industrials, water treatment plants and other diverse markets. Our proprietary technologies and associated product offerings provide purification solutions to enable our customers to reduce certain contaminants and pollutants to meet the challenges of existing and potential future regulations.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we held equity interests of 42.5% and 50.0% in Tinuum Group, LLC ("Tinuum Group") and Tinuum Services, LLC ("Tinuum Services"), respectively, which are both unconsolidated entities, and through December 31, 2021, both contributed significantly to our financial position and results of operations. We account for Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services under the equity method of accounting. As a result of the expiration of Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 45 - Production Tax Credit ("Section 45") refined coal tax credit program effective December 31, 2021, both Tinuum Group and Tinuum Services have substantially ceased operations as of December 31, 2021 and wound down their operations. Further, Tinuum Group is in the process of completing reclamation activities. 
Markets
AC is a specialized sorbent material that is used widely in a host of industrial and consumer applications to remove impurities, contaminants and pollutants from gas, water and other product or waste streams. AC is produced by activating carbonaceous raw materials, including wood, coal, nut shells, resins and petroleum pitch. Properties such as surface area, pore volume, surface chemical functionalities and particle size can be specifically engineered to selectively target various contaminants to meet end-use application requirements. AC can come in several different forms that are important for the end-use application, including powdered activated carbon ("PAC"), granular activated carbon ("GAC"), pellets, honeycombs, blocks or cloths. 
Key markets include removal of pollutants from coal-fired electrical generation and other industrial processes, treatment of drinking and waste waters, industrial acid gas and odor removal, automotive gasoline emission control, soil and ground water remediation and food and beverage process and product purification. 
Demand for AC products has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by increasing environmental regulations pertaining to water and air purification, especially in the developed and more industrialized areas of the world. Additionally, we believe enhanced environmental and health advisory issues will continue to drive demand for AC in rapidly developing countries.
We see opportunities and are continuing to pursue diverse markets for our purification products outside of coal-fired power generation, including industrial applications, water treatment plants and other end markets. In addition, we see significant opportunities emerging in the soil, sediment and groundwater treatment markets. Increased environmental attention has been drawn to the monitoring and treatment of heavy metals, organic and inorganic compounds in groundwater to improve overall drinking water quality across North America. AC, in various forms, has and will continue to play a key role in these remediation efforts.
Our Business
Our products are used to purify contaminated liquid and gas streams from a variety of industrial sources including coal-fired power plants and waste-water treatment plants and other end markets. Most of the North American coal-fired power generators installed equipment to control air pollutants, such as mercury, prior to or since the implementation of the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ("MATS"). However, many power generators need consumable products to complement the operation of installed equipment on a recurring basis to chemically and physically capture mercury and other contaminants. AC has been adopted as the most widely-used technology to capture mercury due to product efficiency and effectiveness, and currently accounts for the majority of the mercury control consumables in the North American market. We offer AC and other chemical products and work with customers as they develop and implement a compliance control strategy which utilizes the consumables solutions that fit with their unique operating and pollution control configuration. 
For the purification of water, AC has been used in the treatment of drinking water, wastewater, contaminated soil and groundwater to adsorb compounds causing unpleasant taste and odor and other contaminants. Both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants have deployed the use of AC in their treatment processes. Groundwater contamination has become a matter of increasing concern to federal and state governments as well as to the public, especially over recent years. The U.S. AC market may see significant growth from water purification markets, especially if future regulations are passed controlling certain chemicals in drinking water. At present, individual states are primarily responsible for the protection of groundwater. The existing technologies for treatment, including removal of the soil for external treatment or landfill, pumping the groundwater above surface for treatment and/or installing treatment trenches or barriers, are expensive and may have complicated life-cycle management requirements. An emerging technology generating increasing interest by site engineering firms and owners is injecting highly engineered ACs into the subsoil, also described as "in situ" treatment, to intercept the contamination plume or to treat the groundwater. In response to this market opportunity, in late 2021, we developed a new Colloidal Carbon Product ("CCP") platform, FluxSorb ISTM, which is currently in the initial stages of in-field testing at multiple contaminated soil and groundwater remediation treatment sites. 
Coal-fired power plants continue to be a significant, though declining, source of electricity in the U.S. Demand for our AC products related to coal-fired electricity generation is dependent on the availability and cost of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas, solar and wind energy. We see opportunities to continue pursuing diverse markets for our purification products outside of coal-fired power generation, including industrial applications, water treatment plants and other markets. 
Sales and Customers
Sales of consumables are primarily made by the Company’s employees to a range of end customers, including coal-fired utilities, industrial companies, water treatment plants and other customers. Our AC sales are generally made under requirements-based contracts ranging from one to five years. Our chemical product sales are generally made on an order by order basis. Revenues from our top three customers comprised approximately 37% of our consolidated consumables revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
Norit Supply Agreement and Related Agreements
On September 30, 2020, we and Cabot Norit Americas, Inc., ("Norit") entered into a supply agreement (the "Supply Agreement") pursuant to which we agreed to sell and deliver to Norit, and Norit agreed to purchase and accept from us, certain lignite-based AC products ("Furnace Products"). The term of the Supply Agreement is for 15 years with 10-year renewal terms that are automatic unless either party provides three years prior notice of intention not to renew before the end of any term.
Under the Supply Agreement, Norit also reimburses us for certain capital expenditures incurred by us that are necessary to manufacture the Furnace Products. Reimbursements are comprised of revenues earned from capital expenditures incurred that will benefit both us and Norit (referred to as "Shared Capital") and revenues earned from capital expenditures incurred that will benefit Norit exclusively (referred to as "Specific Capital"). In the event that Norit ceases to make purchases under the Supply Agreement, Norit is obligated to pay the balance of any outstanding payments for Specific Capital.
Further, under the terms of the Supply Agreement, Norit was obligated to pay us $10.2 million of the certain reclamation costs (the "Reclamation Reimbursement") incurred under a reclamation contract entered into by us and a third party for full reclamation of the Marshall Mine (as defined below), inclusive of interest. 
On February 25, 2022, we received $10.6 million in cash from Norit (the "Norit Payment") as a result of a change in control provision in the Supply Agreement (the "Change in Control"), which occurred as a result of the sale of Norit by its parent, Cabot Corporation. Under the Change in Control, we received from Norit full payment of all amounts outstanding under the Reclamation Reimbursement, payment of all unbilled amounts related to Specific Capital for expenditures incurred through February 28, 2022 and payment of $0.8 million related to additional costs due to the third-party operator of Marshall Mine (the "Norit Reclamation Costs"). Under the reclamation contract, we were obligated to remit payment for the Norit Reclamation Costs to the third-party operator of the Marshall Mine, and such payment was remitted in March 2022. The Change in Control did not impact any other provisions of the Supply Agreement. Additionally, under the Change in Control, we received $1.3 million in advance of revenue to be recognized in future periods related to Specific Capital.
We believe the Supply Agreement will continue to provide material incremental sales volume and lower fixed operating costs on a per unit basis for our manufacturing plant located in Louisiana (the "Red River Plant"). Further, the Supply Agreement has expanded distribution of our AC products to additional markets outside of those we have traditionally served.
Competition
Our primary competitors for consumable sorbent products include Norit, owned by One Equity Partners, Calgon Carbon, a subsidiary of Tokyo Stock Exchange listed Kuraray Co., Ltd. and Donau Carbon Company. Our primary competitors for consumable chemical products include Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (MEEC) and Nalco Holding Company, a subsidiary of Ecolab Inc. (ECL).
Raw Materials
The principal raw material we use in the manufacturing of AC is lignite coal, which is readily available. We source 100% of the lignite coal to fulfill customer orders through our ownership of the Five Forks Mine ("Five Forks"). Five Forks is operated for us by a subsidiary of the North American Coal Company. We may also periodically purchase various ACs to supplement our inventory levels or to produce various products to serve certain AC markets. We purchase these various ACs through supply agreements or spot purchases with the producers. 
We purchase various additives utilized in the production of AC. The manufacturing of AC is dependent upon these various additives, which are subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide the necessary additives needed to manufacture our ACs is limited. We purchase these additives through supply agreements or spot purchases with the producers. Supply agreements with these producers are generally renewed on an annual basis.
We also purchase additives that are included in certain chemical products for resale to our customers through contracts with suppliers. The manufacturing of these consumable products is dependent upon certain discrete additives, which are subject to price fluctuations and supply constraints. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide the necessary additives needed to manufacture our chemical products are limited. We purchase these chemical products through spot purchases with the producers. 
Due to the nature of our business and the marketplace we operate in, there is an ebb and flow in demand for our product and consequently, our inventory levels may vary throughout the year. Across our business, there is at times a need to supplement the available production at our Red River Plant to meet an increase in overall demand for our AC products. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2021, we observed significant increases in demand for our AC products that exceeded our available inventory and production capacity. As a result, we purchased third party products during 2021 and 2022 to supplement our current inventory and to increase our inventory balances to meet customer requirements. As demand for our product increases, we will increase our production, if available to do so, and, as necessary, continue to purchase additional inventory from third parties to meet our customer obligations. 
Operations
We own and operate the Red River plant, which is located in Louisiana. We also lease land on which we operate a production and distribution facility located in Louisiana. Additionally, we have sales, product development and administrative operations located in Colorado. 
In 2020 and in conjunction with the execution of the Supply Agreement, we purchased 100% of the membership interests in Marshall Mine, LLC, which owns a lignite mine located outside of Marshall, Texas (the "Marshall Mine"). We concluded that the Marshall Mine did not have any remaining economic reserves and independently determined to immediately commence activities to shutter it. Accordingly, on September 30, 2020, we entered into a reclamation contract with a third party for the full reclamation of the Marshall Mine. In September 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third-party to sell all membership interests in Marshall Mine, LLC. The obligations of the parties to close the sale transaction are subject to certain events, including (1) obtaining the approval of the Railroad Commission of Texas for an operating permit in the name of the buyer or an affiliate of the buyer, and (2) replacing our surety bond with a reclamation performance bond, letter of credit or other form of security to which the buyer or an affiliate of the buyer is the principal that is satisfactory to the Railroad Commission of Texas. We currently expect to close the sale transaction of the Marshall Mine during the first half of 2023. 
Research and Development Activities
We have conducted research and product development related to the customers and market that we currently serve or are pursuing. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred research and development costs of $0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
Legislation and Environmental Regulations 
Our products and services are used for the reduction of pollutants and other contaminants. Legislation and regulation limit the amount of pollutants and other contaminants permitted and may increase the need for our product. Below is a summary of the primary legislation and regulation that currently affects the market for our current products.
Federal MATS Affecting Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") final "MATS Rule" went into effect in April 2012. The EPA structured the MATS Rule as a Maximum Achievable Control Technology-based ("MACT-based") hazardous pollutant regulation applicable to coal and oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units ("EGU"), which generate electricity through steam turbines and have a capacity of 25 megawatts or greater, and provide for, among other provisions, control of mercury, control of acid gases such as hydrochloric acid and other Hazardous Air Pollutants ("HAPs"). Approximately 1,260 units in the U.S. were coal-fired EGUs when the rule was enacted. According to our estimates, the MATS Rule sets a limit that we believe requires the capture of 80-90% plus of the mercury in the coal burned in electric power generation boilers as measured at the exhaust stack outlet for most plants. The MACT-based standards are also known as National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants ("NESHAP"). Plants generally had four years to comply with the MATS Rule, and implementation of the MATS Rule is now largely completed. We estimate that 52% of the coal-fired units that were operating in December 2012 when the MATS Rule was finalized have been permanently shut down, leaving approximately 469 units in operation in the U.S. as of December 31, 2022.
In April 2017, a review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the "D.C. Circuit") of a 2016 'supplemental finding' associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule conducted by the EPA was stayed at the request of the Trump Administration. The court case continues to be stayed indefinitely. In May 2020, the EPA reconsidered and withdrew its 2016 "supplemental finding" associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule. In this action, the EPA found that it was not "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAPs emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs. However, the EPA expressly stated that the reconsideration neither removed coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS rule, nor rescinded the MATS Rule, which has remained continuously in effect. ADES joined a number of parties in seeking review of this EPA action before the D.C. Circuit. President Biden identified the EPA’s withdrawal of the supplemental finding as one of the actions to be reviewed for conformity with Biden Administration policy, and in February 2021, the Biden Administration moved that the pending judicial review of the supplemental finding withdrawal be held in abeyance. On February 9, 2022, the EPA published a new proposed rule revoking the May 2020 withdrawal of the 2016 supplemental finding and affirming that it is "appropriate and necessary" to regulate HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs, which is currently pending. The D.C. Circuit granted the Biden Administration’s motion, and this appeal also is now in abeyance. The MATS Rule remains in effect.
State Mercury and Air Toxics Regulations Affecting EGUs
In addition, certain states have their own mercury rules that are similar to or more stringent than the MATS Rule. Coal-fired electricity generating units in the U.S are subject to consent decrees that require the control of acid gases and particulate matter, in addition to mercury emissions. 
U.S. Federal Industrial Boiler MACT
In January 2013, the EPA issued the final set of adjustments to the MACT-based air toxics standards for industrial boilers, including mercury, particulate matter and acid gas emission limits. Existing boilers typically had until January 31, 2017 to comply with the rule. On December 1, 2014, the EPA announced the reconsideration of the industrial boiler MACT ("IBMACT") and proposed amendments to the version published January 31, 2013, representing technical corrections and clarifications.he proposed amendments do not affect the applicability of the final rule.
The EPA estimated that approximately 600 coal-fired boilers will be affected by IBMACT, in industries such as pulp and paper. Our estimates, based on conversations with plant operators, suggest that most of the affected plants have either shut down or switched fuels to natural gas to comply with the regulation.
Effluent Limitation Guidelines
In 2015, the EPA set the first federal limits known as effluent limitation guidelines ("ELGs") on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. The final rule requires, among other things, zero discharge for fly ash and bottom ash transport water, and limits on mercury, arsenic, selenium, and nitrate from flue gas desulfurization ("FGD") wastewater. In September 2017, the EPA finalized a rule that delayed the original compliance deadlines for certain wastewater streams from November 2018 to November 2020, with the possibility that plants would not need to comply until December 2023 with state approval. In April 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the EPA’s ELGs that apply to leachate wastewater and "legacy wastewater," and directed the EPA to revise the limits on the levels of toxic metals in those wastewater streams. In November 2019, the EPA proposed to revise the ELGs for bottom ash and FGD wastewater. The final rule, published in the Federal Register on October 13, 2020 and effective on December 14, 2020, does not directly regulate halogens. It does, however, propose to establish a voluntary incentives program for the removal of certain halides. In many (though not all) of the proposed treatment options that the EPA is considering, selenium in FGD wastewater would be regulated. Some halogens may impact the effectiveness of biological wastewater treatment systems that are often used for the removal of selenium. On August 3, 2021, the EPA initiated a supplemental rule-making initiative to strengthen certain discharge limits and stated its intention to issue a proposed rule for public comment in Fall of 2022, which has not yet been issued.
Additional U.S. Legislation and Regulations
In 2015, the EPA finalized rules to reduce greenhouse gases ("GHGs") in the form of the Clean Power Plan ("CPP"), which established guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. Under the CPP, states were required to prepare "State Plans" to meet state targets based on emission reductions from affected sources. The CPP was challenged by multiple states in the D.C. Circuit. The CPP was stayed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The D.C. Circuit held the CPP litigation in abeyance until April 28, 2017, and dismissed the case once the EPA repealed the CPP in July 2019.
The EPA repealed the CPP and replaced it with the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule, which established guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to reduce GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. ACE also requires states to prepare State Plans and prescribes that they must be based on heat rate improvements at affected plants. Numerous states, power companies and non-governmental organizations challenged the ACE rule in the D.C. Circuit, which vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021. On February 12, 2021, EPA stated that neither the ACE or CPP regulations were in place with respect to GHGs for fossil fuel-fired power plants.
International Regulations
There are various international regulations related to mercury control. In Canada, the Canada-Wide Standard ("CWS") was initially implemented in 2010, with increasingly stringent limits through 2020 and varying mercury emissions caps for each province. China and Germany both have limits for mercury emissions that are less stringent than U.S. limits and are typically met using co-benefits from other installed air pollution control equipment designed to control other pollutants. In May 2017, the EU ratified the Minimata Convention on Mercury, triggering mercury control regulations with implementation starting in 2021. Specific emissions limits for dust, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), mercury and particulate matter (PM) are currently being developed guided by the best available technologies reference ("BREF") document for limiting stack emissions and liquid effluents from industrial processes. The BREF conclusions for large coal-fired electricity generating units were adopted by the European Commission in July 2017.
Based on the existing and potential regulations, we believe the international market for mercury control products may expand in the coming years. 
Mining Environmental and Reclamation Matters
Federal, state and local authorities regulate the U.S. coal mining industry with respect to matters such as employee health and safety and the environment, including the protection of air quality, water quality, wetlands, special status species of plants and animals, land uses, cultural and historic properties and other environmental resources identified during the permitting process. Reclamation is required during production and after mining has been completed. Materials used and generated by mining operations must also be managed according to applicable regulations and law. 
The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 ("SMCRA"), establishes mining, environmental protection, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining. Mining operators must obtain SMCRA permits and permit renewals from the Office of Surface Mining (the "OSM") or from the applicable state agency if the state agency has obtained regulatory primacy. A state agency may achieve primacy if the state regulatory agency develops a mining regulatory program that is no less stringent than the federal mining regulatory program under SMCRA. The Five Forks Mine operates in Louisiana, which has achieved primacy and issues permits in lieu of the OSM. The Marshall Mine operates in Texas, which has also achieved primacy and issues permits in lieu of the OSM.
Mine operators are often required by federal and/or state laws, including SMCRA, to assure, usually through the use of surety bonds, payment of certain long‑term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers’ compensation costs, coal leases and other miscellaneous obligations. Although surety bonds are usually noncancelable during their term, many of these bonds are renewable on an annual basis and collateral requirements may change. As of December 31, 2022, we posted a surety bond of approximately $7.5 million for reclamation of the Five Forks Mine and $16.6 million for the reclamation of Marshall Mine.
Patents 
As of December 31, 2022, we held 86 U.S. patents and 12 international patents that were issued or allowed, 13 additional U.S. provisional patents or applications that were pending, and two international patent applications that were either pending or filed relating to different aspects of our technology. Our existing patents generally have terms of 20 years from the effective date of filing, with our next patents expiring in 2024.
Seasonality of Activities 
The sale of our consumable products depends on the operations of the power generation units, industrial facilities and water treatment plants in which the applicable consumables are provided. Power generation is weather dependent, with electricity and steam production varying in response to heating and cooling needs. Additionally, power generating units routinely schedule maintenance outages in the spring and/or fall depending on the operation of the boilers. During the period in which an outage may occur, which may range from one week to over a month, no consumables are used, and our sales may be correspondingly reduced. 
The sale of our AC products for water purification depends on demand from municipal water treatment facilities that use these products. Depending on weather conditions and other environmental factors, the summer months historically have the highest demand for PAC, as one of the major uses for PAC is for the treatment of taste and odor episodes caused by increased degradation of organic contaminants and natural materials in water during the summer. Additionally, the rainy season causes more PAC usage for the municipalities due to rain run-offs and contaminant dilution resulting in higher water treatment volumes.
Safety, Health and Environment
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health, and environmental matters ("SH&E Regulations"). These SH&E Regulations include requirements to maintain and comply with various environmental permits related to the operation of many of our facilities, including mine health and safety laws required for continued operation of the Five Forks Mine.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed 147 personnel, 28 in Colorado and 119 in Louisiana, all of which were employed full-time.
Entry into Material Definitive Agreements
Securities Purchase Agreement
On February 1, 2023 (the "Acquisition Date"), we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") with Arq Limited ("Arq Ltd."), a company incorporated under the laws of Jersey, pursuant to which we acquired all of the direct and indirect equity interests of Arq Ltd.'s subsidiaries (the "Arq Acquisition," and hereafter referred to as "Arq") in exchange for consideration (the "Purchase Consideration") totaling $31.2 million and consisting of (i) 3,814,864 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), valued at $12.4 million and (ii) 5,294,462 shares of the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Series A Preferred Stock"), valued at $18.8 million.
In connection with the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we filed the Certificate of Designations of Preferred Stock for the Series A Preferred Stock (the "Certificate of Designations") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined have the meaning set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Arq Acquisition closed concurrently with execution of the Purchase Agreement.
Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, 833,914 shares of the Series A Preferred stock issued to Arq Ltd. are being held in escrow (the "Escrow Shares") pending a determination by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") that no tax withholding is required on the Purchase Consideration issued to Arq Ltd. ( the "Arq Ltd. Tax Liability"). We have estimated the fair value of the potential Arq Ltd. Tax Liability at $3.3 million. 
We accounted for the Arq Acquisition as an acquisition of a business as of the Acquisition Date. The total Purchase Consideration was $31.2 million and has been preliminarily allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Arq based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. 
Arq's principal office is located in London, United Kingdom, with additional offices located in Lexington and Corbin, Kentucky near its main production facility. Arq is an environmental technology company that has developed a process for transforming coal waste into a purified, microfine carbon powder, known as Arq powderTM ("Arq Powder"), which can be used as an alternative to oil or in-ground mined coal to produce a range of noncombustible and combustible carbon-rich products. With the completion of the Arq Acquisition, we intend to utilize Arq Powder as a feedstock to produce high-quality AC for use in water and air purification markets as well as sell Arq Powder as an additive into other markets.
Series A Preferred Stock
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be automatically converted into a share of Common Stock upon approval by the holders of the percentage of Common Stock required to approve such conversion under the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"), without the need for any action on the part of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Conversion Approval"). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is deemed to have an original issue price of $4.00 per share (the "Original Issue Amount"). The number of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of each share of Series A Preferred Stock shall be equal to the product of (i) the sum of (A) the Original Issue Amount plus (B) an amount equal to the cumulative amount of the accrued and unpaid dividends on such share at such time (regardless of whether or not declared or funds for their payment are lawfully available) divided by (ii) the Original Issue Amount, subject to adjustment as provided in the Certificate of Designations.
Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends which will accrue quarterly on the last day of each applicable quarter (whether or not declared or funds for their payment are lawfully available) and will be payable quarterly, in arrears, on the earlier to occur of (a) the date any dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock with respect to such quarter and (b) 30 days after the end of each quarter (the "Series A Quarterly Dividend") at the rate per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i) if we declare a cash dividend on the Common Stock with respect to such quarter, the amount of the cash dividend that would be received by a holder of Common Stock in which such share of Series A Preferred Stock would be convertible on the record date for such cash dividend and (ii) an annual rate (the "Rate") of 8.0% of the Original Issue Amount per annum compounded quarterly (the "Coupon Dividend") with respect to such quarter. The Rate will increase by 2.0% on the first day of the first quarter ending on or after the 635th day following the closing date of the first issuance of Series A Preferred Stock and on each subsequent anniversary of such date.
The Series A Quarterly Dividend is payable in cash or in additional shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Series A PIK Shares"), at the Company's option. The number of Series A PIK Shares to be issued shall be determined by dividing (i) the Series A Quarterly Dividend payable with respect to all shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by a holder thereof by (ii) the aggregate Original Issue Amount of all shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by a holder thereof, and each fractional Series A PIK Share will be rounded to the nearest whole Series A PIK Share (with 0.5 of a share being rounded down to 0.0).
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, after payment or provision for payment of our debt and other liabilities, a holder of Series A Preferred Stock will receive a liquidating distribution equal to the amount of the cumulative accrued but unpaid dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder. After the payment to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock of such liquidation preference, the holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock will participate pari passu with the holders of Common Stock on an as-converted basis in any remaining distributions out of the Company’s assets available for distribution to stockholders. 
Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will generally have no voting rights. However, we are restricted from taking certain actions without the written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including, but not limited to, consummating a merger with or into another party or a sale of substantially all of our assets; issuing Common Stock or instruments convertible into Common Stock representing more than 20% of our outstanding share capital to the extent the applicable issuance requires approval of holders of Common Stock pursuant to applicable law or the rules of the applicable stock exchange on which the Common Stock is listed; or authorizing, creating or issuing any Senior Stock or Parity Stock (each as defined in the Certificate of Designations) of the Company (or amending the provisions of any existing class of securities to make such class of securities Senior Stock or Parity Stock). In addition, we are restricted from amending our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Series A Preferred Stock without the written consent or affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
If the Conversion Approval has not been obtained prior, each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock will be redeemed by us on February 1, 2028 for cash, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x) 140% and (y) the Original Issue Amount, plus (ii) an amount equal to the cumulative amount of accrued and unpaid dividends on such share of Series A Preferred Stock.
Subscription Agreements
Also, on February 1, 2023, we entered into Subscription Agreements (the "Subscription Agreements") with certain persons (the "Subscribers") pursuant to which the Subscribers subscribed for and purchased shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $15.4 million and at a price per share of $4.00 (the "PIPE Price Per Share" and such transaction, the "PIPE Investment"). The securities issued to the Subscribers under the Subscription Agreements were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), Rule 506 of Regulation D, which is promulgated thereunder, and Regulations S of the Securities Act. ADES and its affiliates relied on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by each of the Subscribers under the Subscription Agreements.
As a requirement of the Arq Acquisition, we appointed three new directors to our Board of Directors (the "New Directors"), each of whom was a director of Arq Ltd, and is considered a related party as of the Acquisition Date. Each of the New Directors individually and/or through their affiliated entities were Subscribers in the PIPE Investment.

Arq Business
Overview
Arq is an environmental technology company that has developed a process for transforming coal waste into a purified, microfine carbon powder, known as Arq Powder, which can be used as an alternative to oil or in-ground mined coal to produce a range of carbon products or as a feedstock for AC. Additionally, Arq has developed a portfolio of additional product opportunities that include using Arq Powder as a component for asphalt, carbon black and power generation, that can achieve similar advantages in other large markets. 
Arq has constructed a production facility at a large coal waste site in Corbin, Kentucky (the "Corbin Facility"). Arq processes coal mining waste and applies patented technology to produce Arq Powder, which has applications in a broad range of carbon products. Arq Powder has unique properties, including low levels of impurities and small average particle size, which when used as a feedstock to produce certain carbon products may provide for advantages compared to coal or oil-based feedstocks in terms of cost and performance.
Arq Powder is in development stage, and we do not expect it to be commercially sold until 2024 due to ongoing capital projects to improve the operating capabilities of the Corbin Facility. We believe the Arq Powder technology has several key environmental benefits: (1) it enables the remediation of waste land, (2) it displaces native coal production while producing valuable products, and (3) it may also have a lower environmental impact than conventional alternatives because Arq Powder is derived from reclaimed waste. 
Strategy
We intend to first sell Arq Powder as a carbon filler for rubber composites and as a component for asphalt with an opportunity to evaluate expanding into other carbon products. These products utilizing Arq Powder are expected to have a lower carbon footprint compared to similar products utilizing conventional materials. These options are currently in various stages of proof of concept testing or customer testing.
As we complete capital upgrades to the Red River Plant, we intend to use Arq Powder as a bituminous based feedstock to produce high-quality AC for use in various markets. 
Through internal testing, we have demonstrated that Arq Powder can be shaped and successfully activated using industrially available equipment, technology, and know-how. In the U.S, the availability of feedstock for GAC manufacturing is limited as it is either supplied by specialty mined coal or coconut husks which need to be imported. 
We believe Arq Powder has the potential to open markets and applications for us, which were previously inaccessible to the lignite-based products made by ADES today. In addition, the Arq Acquistion enables us to have a fully integrated supply chain in multiple feedstocks - bituminous (Arq) and lignite (through the Five Forks Mine) to produce GAC and PAC. 
Arq’s Intellectual Property 
Arq has 21 U.S. and foreign patents issued, with 63 pending patent applications. Arq’s issued patents and pending patent applications span a variety of products and processes, including: fuel oil composition containing solid hydrocarbonaceous and carbonaceous particles; processes for fractionated product from crude oil containing solid hydrocarbonaceous particles; road asphalt feedstock; AC feedstock; anode binder pitch feedstock; needle coke feedstock; delayed coker feedstock; battery graphite feedstock; purified coal product process; and process for blending purified coal products with oils, including bio-components.
Arq also enforces its intellectual property across trademark, copyright, and trade secret matters to protect its intellectual property.
