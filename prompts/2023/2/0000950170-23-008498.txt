 ITEM 1: BUSINESS
 
Company Background
 
Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc. is a holding company that owns subsidiaries engaged in providing a variety of customized transportation and logistics solutions throughout the United States, and in Mexico, Canada and Colombia. Our operating subsidiaries provide customers a broad array of services across their entire supply chain, including truckload, brokerage, intermodal, dedicated and value-added services.
 Our operating subsidiaries provide a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics solutions that allow our customers to reduce costs and manage their global supply chains more efficiently. We market and deliver our services in several ways:
 •Through a direct sales and marketing network focused on selling our portfolio of services to large customers in specific industry sectors;
 •Through company-managed facilities and full-service freight forwarding and customs house brokerage offices; and
 •Through a network of agents who solicit freight business directly from shippers.
 At December 31, 2022, we operated 51 company-managed terminal locations and serviced 63 value-added programs at locations throughout the United States and in Mexico, Canada and Colombia, and we had an agent network totaling approximately 240 agents.
 We were incorporated in Michigan on December 11, 2001. We have been a publicly held company since February 11, 2005, the date of our initial public offering.
Our principal executive offices are located at 12755 E. Nine Mile Road, Warren, Michigan 48089.
Operations
 
We broadly group our revenues into the following service categories: truckload, brokerage, intermodal, dedicated, and value-added services.
 Truckload. Our truckload services include dry van, flatbed, heavy-haul and refrigerated operations. Truckload services represented approximately $230.7 million, or 11.4%, of our operating revenues in 2022. We transport a wide variety of general commodities, including automotive parts, machinery, building materials, paper, food, consumer goods, furniture, steel and other metals on behalf of customers in various industries.
 Brokerage. We provide customers freight brokerage services by utilizing third-party transportation providers to transport goods. Brokerage services also include full service domestic and international freight forwarding, and customs brokerage. In 2022, brokerage services represented approximately $368.9 million, or 18.3%, of our operating revenues.
Intermodal. Intermodal operations include steamship-truck, rail-truck, and support services. Intermodal support services represented $591.9 million, or 29.4%, of our operating revenues in 2022. Our intermodal support services are primarily short-to-medium distance delivery of both international and domestic containers between the railhead or port and the customer.
 Dedicated. Our dedicated services are primarily provided in support of automotive customers using van equipment. In 2022, dedicated services represented approximately $324.6 million, or 16.1%, of our operating revenues. Our dedicated services are primarily short run or round-trip moves within a defined geographic area provided through a network of union and non-union employee drivers, owner-operators, and contract drivers.
 Value-Added. Our value-added services, which are typically dedicated to individual customer requirements, include material handling, consolidation, sequencing, sub-assembly, cross-dock services, kitting, repacking, warehousing and returnable container management. Value-added services represented approximately $499.3 million, or 24.8%, of our operating revenues in 2022. Our facilities and services are often directly integrated into the production processes of our customers and represent a critical piece of their supply chains.
Segments
 We report our financial results in four distinct reportable segments: contract logistics, intermodal, trucking, and company-managed brokerage.
 Operations aggregated in our contract logistics segment deliver value-added and/or dedicated transportation services to support in-bound logistics to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and major retailers on a contractual basis, generally pursuant to terms of one year or longer. Our intermodal segment is associated with local and regional drayage moves predominately coordinated by company-managed terminals using a mix of owner-operators, company equipment and third-party capacity providers (broker carriers). Operations aggregated in our trucking segment are associated with individual freight shipments coordinated primarily by our agents using a mix of owner-operators, company equipment and broker carriers. Our company-managed brokerage segment provides for the pick-up and delivery of individual freight shipments using broker carriers, coordinated by our company-managed operations.
 For additional information on segments, see Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Impact of COVID-19
 Our operations have been impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. We began our COVID-19 response activities in the first quarter of 2020, which required expanded health and safety policies, facility modifications, increased security coverage, and purchase and distribution of personal protective equipment and supplies. Any future waves or outbreaks of alternative strains of the virus could adversely impact our future operations and financial results.
 Business and Growth Strategy
 
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:
Make strategic acquisitions. The transportation and logistics industry is highly fragmented, with hundreds of small and mid-sized competitors that are either specialized in specific vertical markets, specific service offerings, or limited to local and regional coverage. We expect to selectively evaluate and pursue acquisitions that will enhance our service capabilities, expand our geographic network and/or diversify our customer base.
 Continue to capitalize on strong industry fundamentals and outsourcing trends. We believe long-term industry growth will be supported by manufacturers seeking to outsource non-core logistics functions to cost-effective third-party providers that can efficiently manage increasingly complex global supply chains. We intend to leverage our integrated suite of transportation and logistics services, our network of facilities, our long-term customer relationships, and our reputation for operational excellence to capitalize on favorable industry fundamentals and growth expectations.
 Target further penetration of key customers in the North American automotive industry. The automotive industry is one of the largest users of global outsourced logistics services, providing us growth opportunities with both existing and new customers. Of our customers generating revenues greater than $100,000 per year, this sector comprised approximately 36% of operating revenues in 2022. We intend to capitalize on anticipated continued growth in outsourcing of higher value logistics services in the automotive sector such as sub-assembly and sequencing, which link directly into production lines and require specialized capabilities, technological expertise and strict quality controls.

Continue to expand penetration in other vertical markets. We have a history of providing highly complex value-added logistics services to automotive and other industrial customers. We have developed standardized, modular systems for material handling processes and have extensive experience in rapid implementation and workforce training. These capabilities and our broad portfolio of logistics services are transferable across vertical markets. We believe we can leverage the expertise we initially developed in the automotive sector. In addition to automotive, our targeted industries include aerospace, energy, government services, healthcare, industrial retail, consumer goods, and steel and metals.
 Expand our network of agents and owner-operators. Increasing the number of agents and owner-operators has been a driver of our historical growth in transactional transportation services. We intend to continue to recruit qualified agents and owner-operators in order to penetrate new markets and expand our operations in existing markets. Our agents typically focus on a small number of shippers in a particular market and are attuned to the specific transportation needs of that core group of shippers, while remaining alert to growth opportunities.
Competition and Industry
 
The transportation and logistics service industry is highly competitive and extremely fragmented. We compete based on quality and reliability of service, price, breadth of logistics solutions, and IT capabilities. We compete with asset and non-asset based truckload and less-than-truckload carriers, intermodal transportation, logistics providers and, in some aspects of our business, railroads. We also compete with other motor carriers for owner-operators and agents.

Our customers may choose not to outsource their logistics operations and, rather, to retain or restore such activities as their own internal operations. In our largest vertical market, the automotive industry, we compete more frequently with a relatively small number of privately-owned firms or with subsidiaries of large public companies. These vendors have the scope and capabilities to provide the breadth of services required by the large and complex supply chains of automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

We also encounter competition from regional and local third-party logistics providers, integrated transportation companies that operate their own aircraft, cargo sales agents and brokers, surface freight forwarders and carriers, airlines, associations of shippers organized to consolidate their members’ shipments to obtain lower freight rates, and internet-based freight exchanges.

The transportation industry is continuously impacted by new rules and regulations intended to improve the overall safety of the industry. Compliance with such increasingly complex rules continues to constrain the supply of qualified drivers. We believe that our industry will continue to be hindered by an insufficient quantity of qualified drivers which creates significant competition for this declining pool.
 Customers

Revenue is generated from customers throughout the United States, and in Mexico, Canada and Colombia. Our customers are largely concentrated in the automotive, retail and consumer goods, steel and other metals, energy and manufacturing industries.

A significant percentage of our revenues are derived from the domestic auto industry. Of our customers generating revenues greater than $100,000 per year, aggregate sales in the automotive industry totaled 36%, 31% and 29% of revenues during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, General Motors accounted for approximately 16%, 13% and 14% of our total operating revenues, respectively. Sales to our top 10 customers, including General Motors, totaled 42% in 2022. A significant percentage of our revenue also results from our providing capacity to other transportation companies that aggregate loads from a variety of shippers in these and other industries.
 Human Capital Resources
 
Overview. As of December 31, 2022, we had 8,646 employees. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we also engaged, on average, the full-time equivalency of 1,326 individuals on a contract basis. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 39% of our employees in the United States, Canada, and Colombia and 80% of our employees in Mexico were members of unions and subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our union and employee relationships are good.

Diversity and Inclusion. We believe diversity and inclusion are critical to our ability to win in the marketplace and enable our workforce and communities to succeed. Specifically, having a diverse and inclusive workplace allows us to attract and retain the best employees to deliver results for our shareholders. A qualified, diverse, and inclusive workforce also helps us represent the broad cross-section of ideas, values, and beliefs of our employees, customers, and communities. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion means that we will continue to strive to establish and improve an inclusive workplace environment where employees from all backgrounds can succeed and be heard.
Employee Health and Safety. We are committed to being an industry leader in health and safety standards. The physical health, wellbeing, and mental health of our employees is crucial to our success. Most recently, our primary concern during the COVID-19 pandemic has been to do our part to protect our employees, customers, vendors, and the general public from the spread of the virus while continuing to serve the vital role of supplying essential goods to the nation. For essential functions, including our plant workers and driving professionals, we have distributed cleaning and protective supplies to various plants and terminals so that they are available to those that need them, increased cleaning frequency and coverage, and provided employees direction on precautionary measures, such as sanitizing truck interiors, personal hygiene, and social distancing. We will continue to adapt our operations as required to ensure safety while continuing to provide a high level of service to our customers.
 
Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development. We continually strive to hire, develop, and retain the top talent in our industry. Critical to attracting and retaining top talent is employee satisfaction, and we regularly implement programs to increase employee satisfaction. We reward our employees by providing competitive compensation, benefits, and incentives throughout all levels in our organization. Intense competition in the transportation and logistics services industry for qualified workers and drivers has resulted in additional expense to recruit and retain an adequate supply of employees and has had a negative impact on the industry. Our operations have also been impacted, we have periodically experienced under-utilization and increased expenses due to a shortage of qualified workers and drivers. We place a high priority on the recruitment and retention of an adequate supply of qualified workers and drivers.
 Independent Contractor Network
 
We utilize a network of agents and owner-operators located throughout the United States and in Ontario, Canada. These agents and owner-operators are independent contractors.
 
A significant percentage of the interaction with our shippers is provided by our agents. Our agents solicited and controlled approximately 30% of the freight we hauled in 2022, with the balance of the freight being generated by company-managed terminals. Our top 100 agents in 2022 generated approximately 19% of our annual operating revenues. Our agents typically focus on three or four shippers within a particular market and solicit most of their freight business from this core group. By focusing on a relatively small number of shippers, each agent is acutely aware of the specific transportation needs of that core group of shippers, while remaining alert to growth opportunities.

We also contract with owner-operators to provide greater flexibility in responding to fluctuations in customer demand. Owner-operators provide their own trucks and are contractually responsible for all associated expenses, including but not limited to financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and taxes, among other things. They are also responsible for maintaining compliance with Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations.
 Revenue Equipment
 The following table represents our equipment used to provide transportation services as of December 31, 2022:
 

Type of Equipment | Company-owned or Leased | | Owner-OperatorProvided | | Total
Tractors | | 1,847 | | 2,207 | | 4,054

Risk Management and Insurance
 Our customers and federal regulations generally require that we provide insurance for auto liability and general liability claims up to $1.0 million per occurrence. Accordingly, in the United States, we purchase such insurance from a licensed casualty insurance carrier, which is a related party, providing a minimum $1.0 million of coverage for individual auto liability and general liability claims. We are generally self-insured for auto and general liability claims above $1.0 million unless riders are sought to satisfy individual customer or vendor contract requirements. In certain of our businesses, we have secured additional auto liability coverage where we are self-insured for claims above $4.0 million. In Mexico, our operations and investment in equipment are insured through an internationally recognized, third-party insurance underwriter.
 
We typically self-insure for the risk of motor cargo liability claims and material handling claims. Accordingly, we establish financial reserves for anticipated losses and expenses related to motor cargo liability and material handling claims, and we periodically evaluate and adjust those reserves to reflect our experience. Any such adjustments could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
To reduce our exposure to claims incurred while a vehicle is being operated without a trailer attached or is being operated with an attached trailer which does not contain or carry any cargo, we require our owner-operators to maintain non-trucking use liability coverage (which the industry refers to as deadhead bobtail coverage) of $2.0 million per occurrence.
Technology
 We use multifaceted software tools and hardware platforms that support seamless integration with the IT networks of our customers and vendors through electronic data exchange systems. These tools enhance our relationships and ability to effectively communicate with customers and vendors. Our tools and platforms provide real-time, web-based visibility into the supply chains of our customers.

In our contract logistics segment, we customize our proprietary Warehouse Management System (WMS) to meet the needs of individual customers. Our WMS allows us to send our customers an advance shipping notice through a simple, web-based interface that can be used by a variety of vendors. It also enables us to clearly identify and communicate to the customer any vendor-related problems that may cause delays in production. We also use cross-dock and container-return-management applications that automate the cycle of material receipt and empty container return.
Our proprietary and third-party transportation management system allows full operational control and visibility from dispatch to delivery, and from invoicing to receivables collections. For our employee drivers, the system provides automated dispatch to hand-held devices, satellite tracking for quality control and electronic status broadcasts to customers when requested. Our international and domestic air freight and ocean forwarding services use similar systems with added functionalities for managing air and ocean freight transportation requirements. All of these systems have customer-oriented web interfaces that allow for full shipment tracking and visibility, as well as for customer shipment input. We also provide systems that allow agents to list pending freight shipments and owner-operators with available capacity and track particular shipments at various points in the shipping route.

We believe that these tools improve our services and quality controls, strengthen our relationships with our customers, and enhance our value proposition. Any significant disruption or failure of these systems could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and financial results.
 Government Regulation
 
Our operations are regulated and licensed by various U.S. federal and state agencies, as well as comparable agencies in Mexico, Canada, and Colombia. Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to the broad regulatory powers, to include drug and alcohol testing, safety and insurance requirements, prescribed by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), which is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Matters such as weight and equipment dimensions also are subject to United States federal and state regulation. We operate in the United States under operating authority granted by the DOT. We are also subject to regulations relating to testing and specifications of transportation equipment and product handling requirements. In addition, our drivers and owner-operators must have a commercial driver’s license and comply with safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing.
 
Our international operations, which include not only facilities in Mexico, Canada and Colombia but also transportation shipments managed by our specialized service operations, are impacted by a wide variety of U.S. government regulations and applicable international treaties. These include regulations of the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Department of Treasury. Regulations also cover specific commodities, destinations and end-users. Part of our specialized services operations is engaged in the arrangement of imported and exported freight. As such, we are subject to the regulations of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which include significant notice and registration requirements. In various Canadian provinces, we operate transportation services under authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications.

Transportation-related regulations are greatly affected by U.S. national security legislation and related regulations. We believe we comply with applicable material regulations and that the costs of regulatory compliance are an ordinary operating cost of our business that we may not be able to recoup from rates charged to customers.
Environmental Regulation
 We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that focus on, among other things: the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment or their presence at our properties or in our vehicles; fuel storage tanks; transportation of certain materials; and the discharge or retention of storm water. Under specific environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles.
As climate change issues become more prevalent, federal, state and local governments, as well as some of our customers, have made efforts to respond to these issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new legislation or regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us as we may incur additional costs or be required to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations or customer requirements. Legislation or regulations that potentially impose restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels such as those used in the Company’s trucks, could adversely affect our operations and financial results. More specifically, legislative or regulatory actions relating to climate change could adversely impact the Company by increasing our fuel costs and reducing fuel efficiency and could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes, emissions allowances, or required equipment upgrades.
 We believe we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that the cost of compliance has not materially affected results of operations. However, future changes to laws or regulations may adversely affect our operations and could result in unforeseen costs to our business.
 Seasonality
 Generally, demand for our value-added services delivered to existing customers increases during the second calendar quarter of each year as a result of the automotive industry’s spring selling season. Conversely, such demand generally decreases during the third quarter of each year due to the impact of scheduled OEM customer plant shutdowns in July for vacations and changeovers in production lines for new model years.
Our value-added services business is also impacted in the fourth quarter by plant shutdowns during the December holiday period. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on North American automotive manufacturing, we may not experience normal seasonal demand for our services supporting the automotive production and selling cycles during the current year.
Our transportation services business is generally impacted by decreased activity during the post-holiday winter season and, in certain states, during hurricane season. At these times, some shippers reduce their shipments, and inclement weather impedes trucking operations or underlying customer demand.
 Prolonged adverse weather conditions, particularly in winter months, can also adversely impact margins due to productivity declines and related challenges meeting customer service requirements.
