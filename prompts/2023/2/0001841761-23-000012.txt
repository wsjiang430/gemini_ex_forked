Item 1. Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this subsection to the “Company,” “Grove,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiary following the Business Combination, other than certain historical information that refers to the business of Grove Collaborative, Inc. prior to the consummation of the Business Combination. 
Our Vision
Grove Collaborative Holdings, Inc. is transforming the consumer products industry into a force for human and environmental good by relentlessly creating and curating planet-first, high-performance brands and products.  Because sustainability is the only future, and what we do now matters.
Overview
Grove is a digital-first, sustainability-oriented consumer products innovator. We use our connection with consumers to create and curate authentic, disruptive brands and products. Grove builds natural products that perform as well as or better than many leading CPG brands (both conventional and natural), while being healthier for consumers and the planet.
Grove’s omnichannel distribution strategy enables us to reach consumers where they want to shop. We operate an online direct-to-consumer website and mobile application (“DTC platform”) where we both sell our Grove-owned brands (“Grove Brands”) and partner with other leading natural and mission-based CPG brands, providing consumers the best selection of curated products across many categories and brands. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated approximately 48% of our net revenue from Grove Brands, with 61% of that net revenue from home care products. As we grow our product assortment and distribution in beauty and personal care, we expect the contribution of sales from these categories to increase. We expanded into brick-and-mortar retail in April 2021, with the launch of a curated assortment of Grove Co. best sellers in cleaning, hand and dish categories at Target, and have since established additional retail partnerships with Kohl’s, Giant Eagle, Harris Teeter, Meijer, CVS and HEB. Our products are currently sold in over 4,000 stores across these retail partnerships as of December 31, 2022. We believe our retail strategy will generate additional brand awareness, especially as consumer concerns about single-use plastic continue to rise. 
Grove is a public benefit corporation and a Certified B Corporation, meaning we adhere to third party standards for prioritizing social, environmental, and community wellbeing. We have a history of doing well by doing good, which is supported by our flywheel: as we have grown, our product development capabilities and data have improved. That improved innovation grows both topline and, over the longer term, can expand margins as our innovation has historically tended to be both market expanding and margin accretive. Since inception, we have grown rapidly and invested heavily in building out both our Grove ecommerce platform and our Grove Brands, and over this period we have operated at a loss and have an accumulated deficit of $577.9 million as of December 31, 2022. After several years of annual revenue growth, our revenues in the year ended December 31, 2022 were approximately 16% lower than in the prior year period, reflecting the challenges that the industry faces as a result of customers buying behaviors that skewed heavily towards DTC platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic reverting to pre-pandemic levels as well as the pressures of inflation on consumer spending. While we continue to believe that there are long term growth trends in the zero-plastic waste industry and that we will be able to continue to grow our business in the long run, post-pandemic consumer behavior patterns and macro-economic factors will continue to be a risk to our business and will continue to adversely impact our financial performance for at least the near to medium term. In light of these dynamics, our revenue declined in 2022 compared to 2021, with our retail expansion partially offsetting contraction in our direct-to-consumer business. We expect that revenue will further decline in 2023 as we eliminate unprofitable revenue and reduce marketing spending, with retail sales representing a greater proportion of our revenue compared to 2022, before returning to growth beginning in 2024. Our efforts to eliminate unprofitable revenue and drive improved margins are central to operations in order to reach our goal of profitable growth in 2024.
Company History
Grove started in 2012 under the name “ePantry” as an online retailer for third-party natural household, beauty and personal care brands. We leveraged our ecommerce platform to learn about the industry, gain significant insight into consumer preferences and determine how we might drive change. Early on, it became clear that the current carbon, plastic, and ingredient footprint of our industry is unsustainable, and that there will be massive share shift to products that perform while supporting human and environmental health. 
Table of Contents

Our key long-term strategic advantage comes from a combination of our authentic mission and our direct relationships with customers. We gained differentiated insights on consumer preferences and provided a platform for them to tell us what they value in each product category we carried. We paired this insight with best-in-class product innovation capabilities, and in 2016 we launched Grove Co., our flagship home care brand. We have since brought more than 400 Grove Brand products to customers across our portfolio of brands, and Grove Co. has grown into the largest brand by revenue on our DTC platform. 
After building a robust portfolio of highly efficacious, good-for-the-world products, we have recently pushed into an omnichannel model to reach consumers where and how they shop. We continue to operate our DTC platform where we maintain direct relationships with consumers who enjoy our best-in-class assortment of natural home, beauty and personal care products. In 2021, we expanded into brick-and-mortar retail distribution. We continue to actively pursue opportunities to develop our brick-and-mortar retail distribution platform and expand our sales to third-party ecommerce channels. 
On June 16, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), we became a publicly traded company as a result of the consummation of Grove Collaborative, Inc.’s (“Legacy Grove”) merger with Virgin Group Acquisition Corp. II, a Cayman-domiciled blank check company (“VGAC II”), which we refer to herein as the “Business Combination”. Prior to the Business Combination, VGAC II’s public shares, and public warrants were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbols “VGII” and “VGII.WS,” respectively. On June 17, 2022, the Company's Class A common stock and public warrants began trading on (“NYSE”), under the symbols “GROV” and “GROV.WS,” respectively.
Our Purpose
We believe that the consumer products industry has contributed to the current environmental crises, specifically around the proliferation of single-use plastic. We need to create business models and products that meet the environmental needs of our time and the growing demand of consumers who are aware of the importance of making environmentally conscious decisions. 
Sustainability and conscientious business practices are fundamental to our business and are our key differentiators, from our brands, to the products we carry. Our sustainability objectives around plastic and carbon reduction, as well as forest preservation, are rooted in the areas most significant to the environmental impact of our business and our industry. We believe these objectives also intersect areas of growing consumer interest and demand, and we have set ambitious goals to lead across these three objectives.
We believe that the depth and authenticity of our mission is a sustainable competitive advantage in a world where consumers urgently demand more conscientious products. We also believe that our success is driven by our exceptional team, and we believe that our mission is a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent in a competitive market. 
Public Benefit Corporation and Certified B Corporation
We believe that authentic commitment to our vision, and to “doing well by doing good,” is a durable competitive advantage. As a way to codify our values, Grove became a public benefit corporation (“PBC”) in 2021. We are devoted to the development, promotion and distribution of consumer products as a positive force for human and environmental health. As a PBC, we have a legal duty to prioritize not just stockholders’ financial interests, but also the best interest of those materially affected by our business operations, including consumers, employees, partners, the environment and the communities in which we operate. In addition, Grove is a Certified B Corporation, meaning we adhere to rigorous third-party standards for prioritizing social, environmental and community wellbeing, and our performance is periodically independently audited against this framework.
Value Proposition to Consumers
We believe that sustainability should not require a tradeoff. Grove’s products offer a unique blend of sustainability, efficacy, consumer centricity and modern design offered at accessible prices and supported by exceptional customer service and a strong online community. Our Grove Brand products, whether sold on our DTC platform or at retailers, are designed to make it easy for consumers to make environmentally and family-friendly purchasing decisions, knowing that our products prioritize plant-based ingredients, are cruelty-free, and are free of synthetic colors, synthetic fragrances, parabens, phthalates, BPA, and toxic varnishes (based on ingredient declarations, third-party certifications, and independent testing), and are as effective as many traditional competitor products. Our products and packaging help consumers reduce their single use plastic usage. Grove products are designed for consumers to create the best version of their homes and feel good about the choices they are making for their families and the environment.

Our Brands
Brand Strategy 
Increasingly, consumers are demanding brands that are thoughtfully designed with a focus on consumer needs and preferences, and that meet higher standards than ever in sustainability and health. The shift away from plastic in Home and Personal Care (“HPC”) products is a clear consumer and industry trend. Combined with our mission, we believe that our direct relationship with consumers gives us a durable competitive advantage in building the brands to lead that change. All our product innovation work leverages our three pillars of development: consumer centricity, efficacy, and sustainability. To date, we have leveraged this to build the largest DTC natural HPC brand in Grove Co. We also create value for consumers by building other brands and providing additional product options in other categories. 
The Grove Co. Brand
The Grove Co. Brand is a market leader in zero-plastic waste and plastic reduction. It is a thought leader in the home care space and was brought to life under the core proposition: Sustainably Powerful for a Healthy Home and Planet. This is underpinned by clean, safe formulations (no harsh chemicals & 100% naturally derived fragrances), and innovative formats with sustainable packaging and uncompromised performance. Grove Co. products allow consumers to care for their homes, live more sustainably and fully recycle our packaging and formats where such facilities are available to consumers. With an assortment of products ranging from household cleaners to hand and dish soaps to paper-free home tissues and laundry, Grove Co. is the largest brand on our DTC platform. Grove Co. will be our flagship brand as we increasingly look to develop third-party distribution channels. 
Incubator Brands
The rest of our portfolio consists of incubator brands sold primarily on our DTC platform, for which we continue to build brand propositions and product assortments, honing each before expanding into third-party distribution. While still early in the product distribution cycle, each of our incubator brands are category leaders by revenue on the Grove DTC platform. Our incubator brand portfolio includes Peach not Plastic, Rooted Beauty, Superbloom, Honu and Good Fur.
Third-Party Brands
In addition to Grove Brands, we offer a curated portfolio of third-party brands on our DTC platform, providing consumers with a selection of over 3,000 SKUs across more than 200 brands. These brand relationships provide customers with breadth across product categories, while reinforcing Grove’s position as the destination for discovery and providing us with valuable data on customer purchasing behavior and preferences.
We carry a wide range of clean and natural products within home, beauty and personal care, including products aimed at baby and pet care. No single third-party brand represented more than 15% of our total net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022. Since our inception, we have attracted and maintained strong relationships with a diverse group of clean and natural brands within home care, beauty and personal care, from emerging brands such as Aunt Fannie’s, Hello, and Terra Beauty Bars to globally recognized brands such as Mrs. Meyers, Seventh Generation, Method, Burt’s Bees and Babyganics. Prior to onboarding new brand partners, all brands undergo a thorough review process to ensure they meet our rigorous sustainability criteria, including goals to reduce and eliminate plastic, safe and transparent ingredient standards, certified cruelty-free products, and ethical production. 
We take a data-driven approach to category expansion by leveraging the insights garnered through our DTC platform. By carrying third-party products, we are not only able to better serve our customers by providing a wider product assortment, but we are able to understand both category demand and the product attributes that our consumers value before investing in development of our own products. 
We offer a highly compelling proposition to our third-party brands by providing access to more than 1.3 million environmentally-conscious and digitally-savvy customers who shopped on our DTC platform in 2022. We consider these third-party brands to be important long-term partners both in serving our customers on our digital platform and in changing the industry for the better. We expect to continue to collaborate with these brands to help bring their complementary products to consumers while also executing on our strategy to make our DTC platform a destination for consumer discovery. Over the long term, we do not view the trends driving Grove’s growth as winner-take-all. Instead, we believe that lifting the industry towards zero plastic waste will be the “new normal” and will materially benefit Grove.

Product Development and Innovation
We believe we have a durable competitive advantage in product development, based on the data and consumer insights garnered through our DTC platform. We estimate that we can develop products faster than most traditional CPG companies using a variety of strategies only available as a result of our DTC platform: 
•We can test market acceptance of product attributes prior to or as part of product launch, including fragrance, price point, marketing messaging, sustainability and more. We can assess market acceptance of products on our DTC platform prior to a product ready date to determine consumer interest via our waitlist feature. 
•We can quickly gather consumer feedback by including samples in existing shipments, conducting online focus groups, and asking our consumers directly. We can then improve the products where possible and relaunch or drop underperforming SKUs at relatively little cost. 
•We can launch products on our DTC platform at any point, without the constraints of retailer shelf reset timelines. 
•We have a deep understanding of our consumers based on historical purchasing behavior, demographic information, and the ways in which they engage with our community and platform. 
In addition, our research and product development team brings both HPC product experience as well as digital channel know-how to our innovation road map. We believe the combination of best-in-class data along with our innovation capabilities allows us to consistently produce high-quality, efficacious products with a speed to market unmatched in our industry.
Sustainability and Environmental Health and Safety
Our corporate sustainability ethos and sustainable product offering are Grove’s primary differentiator. Our customers demonstrate a prioritization for our carefully curated and screened products that align with their values around environmental health and safety. As part of that value proposition, we pride ourselves on our industry-leading work in sustainability around the areas most material to our business: plastic, carbon and forests. 
Plastic
The HPC industry has been built on seemingly cheap and disposable single-use plastic packaging. As consumers awaken to the reality of the plastic pollution crisis, they are urgently and increasingly demanding bold new solutions. 
Plastic Neutrality. Grove is leading the industry in becoming a plastic-neutral consumer products retailer. For every ounce of plastic we sell, we fund the collection of an equal amount of ocean-bound or terrestrial plastic pollution to mitigate our plastic footprint while we transition to long-term plastic-free solutions. We work with rePurpose Global to fund plastic pollution collection and infrastructure development in India, Kenya and Colombia.
Beyond Plastic. Our industry has historically addressed the plastic pollution crisis by setting unrealistic goals about recycled content that will be impossible to achieve given the realities of recycling infrastructure. Our goal to be “Beyond Plastic” (our standard which indicates the best-available solutions in either zero plastic, refillable or reusable products containing minimal plastic) across our site by the end of 2025 is meant to engender bold action and spur our industry towards plastic-free or low-plastic innovation. This is necessary in order to move away from plastics that are contributing to fossil fuel extraction, global pollution and the erosion of core ecosystems. While we recognize that some plastics may still be unavoidable given the absence of feasible alternatives, our intention is to make as much of our packaging and product assortment free from virgin, single-use plastic and shift towards a model of refill and reuse.
Forests
Our industry is heavily dependent on natural fiber, and paper goods are a staple of home essentials. Without a robust commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain or to increase the recycled content within paper products, the HPC industry supports a fiber industry which is increasingly at odds with the reforestation and biodiversity protection that climate science calls for with increasing urgency. Our aim is to restore forests through our business, both by avoiding use of paper products that contribute to deforestation as well as by actively funding reforestation, both directly and through our carbon offset program. 
Two Million Acres of Forest. Through the Arbor Day Foundation, we met our goal of one million trees planted in April of 2022. This initiative is included within the One Trillion Trees Initiative, to which Grove is a signatory. As our next iteration of this goal, we will work with The Nature Conservancy to protect 2 million acres of American forests in the Alaskan Tongass by 2030. 
Table of Contents

Tree-Free Paper. Grove’s line of tree-free paper products is made entirely from Forest Stewardship Council certified bamboo, a sustainable and fast-regenerating fiber. Not only do Grove’s paper products offer a high-quality alternative to traditional paper products that contribute to deforestation, but they support our goals around forest protection.
Carbon
Our goal is to decouple the growth of our business from our carbon footprint through a focus on mitigation and supplier engagement. For our remaining emissions, we are committed to the highest standard of offset purchases, with a focus on nature-based projects which prioritize habitat protection, biodiversity and supporting local and indigenous communities. 
CarbonNeutral Certified Company. We are proud to be a Certified CarbonNeutral company since 2021, meaning that we have purchased carbon offsets to neutralize all of the emissions related to the business activities that are under our direct control, which excludes manufacturing and supply chain. In order to maintain this certification, we are required to continue to reduce or offset the carbon emissions generated by our business activities, consumer shipments and several other areas of our company indicated by the CarbonNeutral protocol. This codifies our commitment to maintain our values as our business grows. 
Net Zero by 2030. Expanding upon our efforts to mitigate and neutralize our direct emissions, we are committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by or before 2030 for our entire carbon footprint for greenhouse gas (“GHG”) Protocol Scopes 1-3 (which include all business activities, product manufacturing and our supply chain). We plan to achieve this through a primary focus on mitigation, with nature-based offsets augmenting the effort. We will disclose our annual progress towards achieving these goals in our annual sustainability report. 
Science-Based Targets. With a priority on reducing our emissions as much as possible, we have set Science-Based Targets across scopes 1-3. We will continue to report on our progress in our annual sustainability report. 
Our Customers
We seek to build a brand that appeals to a broad consumer population, and we have found that our customer base is diverse and expansive, reinforcing our belief that our product offerings, brands, and value proposition span gender, age, geography, ethnicity, and household income across the United States. We regularly conduct surveys, and, based on customer feedback, we believe that our typical customer cares deeply about their family and their homes, seeks safe and effective products, and is conscientious about the impact they have on the planet. Motivated by a desire to learn and discover, they are spending more time engaging with the natural HPC category and making sustainable choices as part of their environmentally conscious lifestyle. Of note, we see success in geographies across political and demographic groups, not just with a niche of “dark green” consumers. 
Our Omnichannel Distribution Strategy
We reach consumers through both DTC and retail channels to maximize exposure to our consumers. Our omnichannel approach enables us to reach more customers with differentiated offerings. Our channels are complementary to each other and learnings from each further enhance the entire Grove community. 
DTC Platform
Our website enables consumers to view our entire product portfolio including Grove Brand and third-party products across a variety of categories. Through the website, we offer customers exclusive deals and offers, share newly launched products and display our wide array of seasonal bundles. We offer customers our flexible monthly subscribe-and-save shipment service to help them stay on top of their home care regimen, as well as non-subscription options to ship as needed. Customers can subscribe to individual products at appropriate cadences to make sure they never run out. We leverage data to further enhance the customer experience by personalizing pages to better fit the customers shopping needs. Our DTC shoppers can reach out to our Grove Guides team for any questions pertaining to their orders. Customers can call, chat, text, or email our Grove Guides team to modify orders, ask about new products, request a refund, or learn more about our sustainability practices. All of our shipments are carbon neutral and all plastic sold is offset through our partnerships with rePurpose Global. 
Grove believes that we can go farther together in achieving the shared goal of making our industry more sustainable. We remain committed to building high-value, long-term relationships with other leading brands that can complement the Grove Brand products in our DTC offering. For our third-party brand partners, our DTC platform provides a unique way for our partners to tell their brand and product stories to consumers at scale. We provide a dedicated channel that enables brands to reach customers whose values are aligned with our brand partners directly, which our partners may be unable to 
Table of Contents

reach through typical brick-and-mortar channels. Our DTC platform also provides a channel for our partners to launch and scale plastic-free or low-plastic packaging. Our direct connection to consumers aids our partners by providing valuable product feedback at a rate typically much faster than retail channels. As a result of our scale and strict product standards, we believe placement on our platform provides a positive brand association for our partners. 
Retail
We expanded into brick-and-mortar retail in April 2021, with the launch of a curated assortment of Grove Co. best sellers in cleaning, hand and dish categories at Target, in a nationwide partnership both in store and on Target.com, including endcap, category and mobile app activation. Our products are in all Target stores across the United States, in over 1,900 retail doors and we doubled our assortment in 2022. We also expanded our retail partners to include Kohl’s, Giant Eagle, Harris Teeter, Meijer, CVS and HEB with additional major national retailers including Walmart and Costco expected to launch in 2023. Our products are currently sold in over 4,000 stores across these retail partnerships as of December 31, 2022. We believe our retail strategy will generate additional brand awareness, especially as consumer concerns about single-use plastic continue to rise.
Our Grove Brand products that are sold at retail outlets offer an attractive value proposition to our omnichannel retail partners. Our products offer low-risk, incremental revenue stemming from our DTC proof points and the benefit of association with our earth-friendly market positioning. Retailers understand the importance of offering consumers zero-waste options, and Grove’s assortment is a market leader. While the distribution of Grove Brand products through our omnichannel retail partners was not material to our financial results in 2021 or 2022, we expect retail expansion to be a significant driver of growth and revenue in future years.
Supply Chain and Operations
Freight
Our freight strategy focuses on inbound and outbound transportation. For inbound shipments, we utilize state-of-the-art transportation management systems that optimize time and costs. For outbound fulfillment parcel shipping, we partner with national as well as regional carriers to ensure timely and efficient delivery to our customers. We utilize a rate-shop service to identify best pricing and time in transit for our delivery points. Freight costs represent a significant portion of our operating expenses.
Fulfillment
We have three fulfillment centers dedicated to our DTC platform, which are capable of reaching approximately 91% of our consumers with two-day or faster shipping. We fulfill orders for our retail partners through third-party logistics partnerships. We also regularly work to optimize and automate our operations to improve our margin profile while ensuring a seamless shopping experience for customers. 
Supply Chain
We maintain a diversified global supply chain for sourcing our Grove Brand products to ensure product quality and integrity. Grove suppliers are required to meet standards around workplace safety and conditions, human rights record and product liability coverage. In addition, Grove is a member of Amfori’s Global BSCI audit platform that is working to improve social performance in human supply chains. 
Tying our supply chain to our emissions reduction goals, we have set Science-Based Targets (for Scopes 1-3 and are collecting emissions data from all top suppliers. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. 
Our Grove Brands face significant competition from both established, well-known legacy HPC players as well as from emerging direct-to-consumer brands. Select competitors include: The Clorox Company (parent company of Burt’s Bees), Colgate-Palmolive Company (parent company of Tom’s of Maine and hello), The Honest Company, Procter & Gamble (parent company of Native), Reckitt Benckiser Group plc., SC Johnson (parent company of method and Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day), and Unilever PLC (parent company of Seventh Generation). Certain of these and other competitive brands are also vendor partners on our DTC platform. 
We compete based on a variety of factors, including product efficacy, clean formulation, sustainability, price and value. We believe that we compete favorably across these factors. 
Our DTC platform competes with players across two primary channels: (i) brick-and-mortar businesses including supermarkets, warehouse clubs and mass merchants and (ii) ecommerce platforms and online retailers. 
Table of Contents

We compete based on a variety of factors, including product availability, value, trust, and convenience, as well as our ability to connect with and establish direct relationships with our consumers. We believe that we compete favorably across these factors. 
Human Capital
We strive to make our workplace, our products, and our services more equitable and inclusive. We believe an inclusive culture contributes to Grove’s success in spreading healthy habits. 
Our People 
We value our employees. They are our most important asset and key to the success of our company and mission. We seek to recruit and retain talented and engaged team members who are committed to our values, goals, and our community. The passion of our employees is evident in the design and delivery of our products, the support we provide to our consumers and the impact we are making in our community and industry. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 550 full-time employees, as well as a smaller number of part-time and temporary employees; approximately 70% of our total employee population is located in our fulfillment centers. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
We believe that a more inclusive and equitable HPC industry starts with a strong commitment within our workplace, as well as on our virtual shelves. From the beginning, we have been focused on building a team where all employees and customers are seen, heard and feel valued. We began our diversity, equity and inclusion journey by engaging our employees and leaders in trainings that require critical thinking, programs that inspire grassroots action, and conversations that open us up to diversity of thought. This foundational framework was more important for us to focus on before we hit the checkmarks, because a company with good-looking numbers means nothing if we cannot thrive. 
Facilities
Our corporate headquarters is located in San Francisco, California, and we use this facility for engineering, finance, marketing, human resources, legal, information technology and security, physical product development, research and science, supply chain, and other administrative functions. We are committed to utilizing a hybrid workforce and as such, we are actively marketing a portion of this space for sublease.
We also lease three fulfillment center locations in Reno, Nevada; St. Peters, Missouri; and Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, which we use for inbound and receiving, packing and shipping, transportation, operations technology, warehouse IT, operations management, and human resources. 
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity
We invest in cybersecurity to protect intellectual property, customer data, manage reputational risk, and maintain business continuity across our devices, applications, and corporate networks. We strive to ensure ongoing compliance with the requirements under relevant standards including PCI, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), and relevant data privacy and protection regulations. Additionally, our teams use the standards, guidelines, and practices from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to understand and manage cybersecurity risk. We continually monitor and proactively address identified cyber security risks through a combination of automated tools, external audits, and recurring review from our internal cybersecurity working group and report any material findings and incidents to the audit committee of the board of directors. Our data privacy practices are designed to ensure security, compliance, and privacy while collecting, storing, and creating insights from the data. 
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions on access to our proprietary technology. Our principal trademark assets include the trademarks “Grove,” “Grove Co.,” and “Grove Collaborative,” which are registered in the U.S. and targeted foreign jurisdictions, as well as our logos, taglines and multiple product brand names. We have applied to register or registered many of our trademarks in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and we will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe they would be beneficial and cost-effective. 
Worldwide, we have 16 issued patents and 11 patent applications pending. Our issued patents will begin expiring in December 2028. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We are the registered holder of multiple domestic and international domain names that include “grove” and similar variations. We also hold domain registrations for many of our product names and other related trade names and slogans. In 
Table of Contents

addition to the protection provided by our intellectual property rights, we enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors and business partners. Our employees are also subject to invention assignment agreements. We further control the use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property through provisions in both our customer terms of use on our website and the terms and conditions governing our agreements with other third parties. 
Government Regulation
The vitamins/dietary supplements, foods, OTC drugs, cosmetic products and medical device products we sell under our own brands and from third-party brands are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). Substantially all of our products are subject to regulation by one or more of the following: the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”), the EPA, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), as well as various other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations principally relate to the ingredients or components, proper labeling, advertising, packaging, marketing, manufacture, registration, safety, shipment and disposal of our products. 
Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), cosmetics are defined as articles or components of articles that are applied to the human body and intended to cleanse, beautify, promote attractiveness or alter its appearance, with the exception of soap. The labeling of cosmetic products is also subject to the requirements of the FDCA, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and other FDA regulations. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA, however certain ingredients, such as color additives, must be pre-authorized. If the safety of the products or ingredients has not been adequately substantiated, a specific warning label is required. Other warnings may also be mandated pursuant to FDA regulations. The FDA monitors compliance of cosmetic products through market surveillance and inspection of cosmetic manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the products neither contain false nor misleading labeling and that they are not manufactured under unsanitary conditions. Inspections also may arise from consumer or competitor complaints filed with the FDA. In the event the FDA identifies false or misleading labeling or unsanitary conditions or otherwise a failure to comply with FDA requirements, we may be required by a regulatory authority or we may independently decide to conduct a recall or market withdrawal of our product or to make changes to our manufacturing processes or product formulations or labels.
On December 23, 2022, Congress passed the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. Included in the Omnibus Reform package is the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (“MOCRA”), which provides FDA with additional authority to regulate cosmetic products. MOCRA, when fully implemented by FDA, will require, among other things, the reporting to FDA of serious adverse events associated with the use of a cosmetic product in the United States, cosmetic facility registration and product listing, the maintenance of safety substantiation files and the establishment of good manufacturing practices for cosmetics. MOCRA also provides FDA with mandatory recall authority over cosmetic products.
Our tampon, feminine and sexual health products are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and must be manufactured in an establishment registered with the FDA and in conformity with applicable regulatory clearances, device listing and quality system regulations. In addition, there are requirements for the reporting of certain adverse events or medical device reports for medical devices.
The FDA may change the regulations as to any product category, requiring a change in labeling, product formulation or analytical testing. 
We are subject to regulation by the CPSC under the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and other laws enforced by the CPSC. These statutes and the related regulations establish safety standards and bans for consumer products. The CPSC monitors compliance of consumer products under its jurisdiction through market surveillance and has the authority to conduct product safety related inspections of establishments where consumer products are manufactured, held, or transported. The CPSC has the authority to require the recall of noncompliant products or products containing a defect that creates a substantial risk of injury to the public. The CPSC may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. CPSC regulations also require manufacturers of consumer products to report to the CPSC certain types of information regarding products that fail to comply with applicable regulations, that contain a defect which could create a substantial product hazard, or that create an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death. Certain state laws also address the safety of consumer products and mandate reporting requirements, and noncompliance may result in penalties or other regulatory action. 
Certain of our products are also subject to regulation by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”). FIFRA establishes a system of pesticide, including disinfectant products, regulation to protect applicators, consumers and the environment. Under FIFRA, certain of our cleaning products, including the disinfectant products, may require approval from and registration with the EPA prior to sale. Products subject to FIFRA must comply with specified approval, registration, manufacture, labeling, and reporting requirements, among other requirements. The 
Table of Contents

EPA is authorized to take enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of non-compliant disinfectant products, including to prevent the sale or distribution of unregistered disinfectants and to prevent the sale or distribution of registered pesticides that are not permitted to make claims permitted by the terms of their registration, among other areas of non-compliance. The EPA may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Manufacturers subject to FIFRA are also required to register with the EPA and report certain types of information regarding disinfectant products to the EPA. Importers and exporters of products regulated under FIFRA are also subject to filing and other requirements. Certain state laws may also impose requirements applicable to cleaning products, and non-compliance may result in penalties or other regulatory action. 
The USDA enforces federal standards for organic production and use of the term “organic” on certain product labeling, including for foods and dietary supplements. These laws prohibit a company from selling or labeling products as organic unless they are produced and handled in accordance with the applicable federal law. 
The FTC, FDA, USDA, EPA, and other government authorities also regulate advertising and product claims regarding the characteristics, quality, safety, performance and benefits of our products. These regulatory authorities typically require a safety assessment of the product and reasonable basis to support any factual marketing claims. What constitutes a reasonable basis for substantiation can vary widely from market to market, and there is no assurance that our efforts to support our claims will be considered sufficient. The most significant area of risk for such activities relates to improper or unsubstantiated claims about the composition, use, efficacy and safety of our products and their environmental impacts. If we cannot adequately support safety or substantiate our product claims, or if our promotional materials make claims that exceed the scope of allowed claims for the classification of the specific product, the FDA, FTC or other regulatory authority could take enforcement action, impose penalties, require us to pay monetary consumer redress, require us to revise our marketing materials or stop selling certain products and require us to accept burdensome injunctions, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.
The FTC recently issued the “Health Products Compliance Guide” (“FTC Guide”) which provides guidance from FTC regarding how companies should ensure that claims about the benefits and safety of health-related products are truthful, not misleading, and supported by science. This new FTC Guide applies to all products making health-related claims, including, but not limited to, food, over-the-counter drugs, dietary supplements and homeopathic products. Of significance, the FTC Guide provides that, as a general matter, substantiation of these type of claims will require randomized, controlled human clinical testing; animal and in vitro studies may provide useful supporting or background information, but, without confirmation by human clinical testing, they are not sufficient to substantiate health-related claims.
In addition, the FTC regulates the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising as well as relationships between advertisers and social media influencers pursuant to principles described in the FTC’s Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (the “Endorsement Guides”). The Endorsement Guides provide that an endorsement must reflect the honest opinion of the endorser and cannot be used to make a claim about a product that the product’s marketer could not itself legally make. They also say that if there is a connection between an endorser and the marketer that consumers would not expect and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, that connection should be disclosed. Another principle in the Endorsement Guides applies to ads that feature endorsements from people who achieved exceptional, or even above average, results from using a product. If the advertiser does not have proof that the endorser’s experience represents what people will generally achieve using the product as described in the ad, then an ad featuring that endorser must make clear to the audience what results they can generally expect to achieve, and the advertiser must have a reasonable basis for its representations regarding those generally expected results. Although the Endorsement Guides are advisory in nature and do not operate directly with the force of law, they provide guidance about what the FTC staff generally believes the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) requires in the context using of endorsements and testimonials in advertising and any practices inconsistent with the Endorsement Guides can result in violations of the FTC Act’s proscription against unfair and deceptive practices. 
To the extent we may rely on endorsements or testimonials, we will review any relevant relationships for compliance with the Endorsement Guides and we will otherwise endeavor to follow the FTC Act and other legal standards applicable to our advertising. However, if our advertising claims or claims made by our social media influencers or by other endorsers with whom we have a material connection do not comply with the Endorsement Guides or any requirement of the FTC Act or similar state requirements, the FTC and state consumer protection authorities could subject us to investigations and enforcement actions, impose penalties, require us to pay monetary consumer redress, require us to revise our marketing materials and require us to accept burdensome injunctions, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. 
We are also subject to a number of U.S. federal and state laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be

interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and local laws regarding privacy and protection of people’s data. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the U.S. Federal and state laws in the U.S. and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of the sale of personal information with third parties and prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against California residents (for example, charging more for services) for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA. The law also provides a private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information. In addition, California voters recently approved the CPRA, which went into effect on January 1, 2023. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, potentially resulting in further complexity. The law, among other things, gives California residents the ability to limit the use of their sensitive information, provide for penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the law. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy and data protection which could affect us. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data or our marketing practices, fines or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. 
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are subject to various claims, charges and litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We believe these actions are a normal incident of the nature and kind of business in which we are engaged. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, we do not believe that any asserted or unasserted legal claims or proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 
As noted in “Risk Factors,” the Consumer Protection Division of the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office, in conjunction with other county and city prosecutors, is currently investigating our automatic renewal practices, and the Federal Trade Commission is currently investigating our billing and automatic renewal practices. As of the date of this filing, no legal proceeding has commenced regarding these investigations.
