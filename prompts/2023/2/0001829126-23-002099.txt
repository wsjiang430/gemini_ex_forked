Item 1. Business
 
Airspan Networks Holdings Inc. (“Airspan”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) is a designer and producer of wireless network equipment for 4G and 5G networks for both mainstream public telecommunications service providers and private network implementations.
 
Overview
 
We are a U.S. headquartered, award-winning technical leader, in the 4G and 5G Radio Access Network (“RAN”) and broadband access solutions market. We offer a broad range of software defined radios, broadband access products and network management software to enable cost-effective deployment and efficient management of mobile, fixed and hybrid wireless networks. Our customers include leading mobile communications service providers (“CSPs”), large enterprises, military communications integrators and internet service providers (“ISPs”) working to deliver high-capability broadband access to numerous markets. Our mission is to disrupt and modernize network total cost of ownership (“TCO”) models. We aim to lower costs for customers throughout the product lifecycle, from procurement through commissioning and ongoing operating costs. We have been pioneering wireless technology for over 20 years and are distinguished by our deep customer relationships, innovative product design capabilities and expertise in solving technical challenges at the network edge, where a device or local network interfaces with the Internet or other networks.
 
In 4G mobile networks, we established ourselves as an expert in network densification by focusing on solving the problems associated with physically locating, installing and commissioning networks consisting of hundreds of thousands of small cells as an alternative and supplement to macro cell-based networks. Software-defined and cost-optimized radio platforms, self-organizing/optimization algorithms and minimum power consumption have been critical to our 4G business and are expected to be even more critical to the deployment and expansion of new 5G networks. As an early leader in 5G OPEN-RAN standards, we have worked to unbundle the monolithic network architectures previously dominated by large incumbent suppliers such as Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (“Ericsson”), Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (“Huawei”), and Nokia Corporation (“Nokia”). As a foundational member of the 5G ecosystem, we work closely with wireless operators, chipset suppliers and infrastructure vendors around the world on 5G developments, trials, pilots and initial 5G deployments.
 
We started our business in digital wireless access, primarily voice services, rapidly becoming a leader in high performance wireless data networks. Our acquisition of Mimosa Networks, Inc. (“Mimosa”) in 2018 strengthened our position in the wireless broadband access market. Mimosa’s capabilities and innovation in wireless broadband point-to-point and point-to-multipoint networks strengthened our disruptive position in the mobile 4G/5G network densification space and expanded our existing North American presence with an engineering center in Silicon Valley. Mimosa’s channel-led sales strategy enhances the distribution of our existing products for specific vertical markets, such as private 4G and 5G and applications in citizens broadband radio service (“CBRS”). On March 8, 2023, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement to sell the Mimosa business to one of Airspan’s major customers while retaining a reseller arrangement to continue to market and sell the Mimosa products. (See Recent Developments).
 
The Wireless Communications Industry
 
The wireless industry has evolved from Marconi’s 1897 18-mile communication to a tugboat to high speed mobile broadband. Launched in 2002, 3G cellular technology networks provided connectivity to access the World Wide Web from mobile devices and high-powered smart phones and apps began to change the way we live. Launched in 2010, higher speed 4G networks introduced the concept of mobile broadband, connected enterprise applications to cloud computing and began to modernize the way people communicate, interact and work. Presently, 5G networks, with up to 100 times the speed and as little as 10% of the latency (network edge turnaround time) of 4G networks, are expected to be foundational to the development and expansion of autonomous vehicles, telemedicine, live ultra-high definition video streaming, cloud gaming, edge computing and numerous industrial applications, such as augmented reality and robotics for smart manufacturing, supply chain automation and military and defense applications.

Over the next ten years, we believe that 5G networks will become increasingly common across much of the globe, an expansion that will require substantial investment from stakeholders. Operators will need to invest in spectrum rights, network equipment and deployment well in advance of realization of any increase in revenues from the new capabilities that 5G networks offer. Airspan is working with leading global service providers and enterprises in the mobile and fixed wireless access (“FWA”) ecosystems to develop, commercialize and accelerate the availability of Open Standard 5G solutions that enable cost-efficient initial deployment and then, based on such open standards, allow those networks to efficiently adapt and grow in response to the emerging applications that are expected to generate increased revenue streams to recoup such network investments.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our mission is to disrupt and modernize network TCO models, providing innovative solutions that meet specific application requirements at the network edge. In support of this mission, we pursue a strategy focused on customer responsiveness, technology leadership and excellence in execution.

● | Industry Relationships. We have relationships with some of the world’s most innovative Tier-1 CSPs including SoftBank, Reliance Jio and Rakuten. We have helped specialized private network operators like GoGo (in-flight internet) and McLaren (automotive connectivity) to address the challenges associated with high speed cellular networks. We have worked closely with leading edge technology companies such as Qualcomm Incorporated and Quantenna Communications Inc. In partnership with these customers and suppliers, we have helped to address the challenges of next generation RAN deployments at scale, while building a portfolio of solutions to help innovators deploy novel and innovative networks, augmenting our technology portfolio, creating greater visibility into our end markets and informing our product development road map.

Seasonality
 
We generally have lower sales in the first quarter of the calendar year than the final quarter of the preceding year.
 
Regulation
 
In addition to regulations of general application to global business, we are subject to a number of regulatory requirements specific to the wireless communications industry. Our products are subject to rules relating to radio frequency spectrum allocation and authorization of certain radio equipment promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission or the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.
 
The applicable regulatory agency in each jurisdiction adopts regulations to manage spectrum use, establishes and enforces priorities among competing uses, limits harmful radio frequency interference and promotes policy goals such as broadband deployment. These spectrum regulations regulate allocation, licensing and equipment authorizations. Since our customers purchase devices to operate in specific spectrum bands allocated by the regulatory authorities, our products must meet the technical requirements set forth for such spectrum allocation(s).
 
In some bands, the operator must seek prior regulatory authority to operate using specified frequencies, and the resulting spectrum license authorizes the licensee, for a limited term, to operate in a spectrum consistent with licensed technical parameters within a specified geographic area. We design and manufacture our products to comply with these technical parameters.
 
Our products generally are subject to compliance testing prior to approval, and, as a condition of authority in each jurisdiction, we must ensure that our products have the proper labels and documentation specifying such authority. We generally use telecommunications certification bodies to obtain certification for our devices in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market and sell our products.
 
Competition
 
We compete in two broad markets: mobile RAN equipment and services and wireless broadband access. We compete with large direct competitors in the RAN market such as Ericsson, Huawei, Nokia, Samsung Group and ZTE Corporation as well as smaller players such as Casa Systems, Inc., Inseego Corp, JMA Wireless, KMW Co Ltd, and Mavenir. In the broadband market, we have direct competitors as well as competing access technologies. The competing technologies include wireline Digital Subscriber Line (“DSL”), fiber, cable and satellite. Direct wireless broadband competition includes Cambium Networks, Proxim Wireless Corporation, Ruckus Networks, a division of CommScope Inc. and Ubiquiti Inc., and many other smaller companies. In addition, some of the entities to which we currently sell our products may develop the capacity to manufacture their own products.
 
When competing with the large incumbents for business in 4G networks, we rely on software centric small cell experience to provide densification solutions that fit under our larger end-to-end competitors’ macro cell architectures. Our 4G market has been limited to customers with severe capacity restrictions such as Sprint and Reliance that are difficult to address without massive densification. As 5G technology becomes more prevalent across the markets in which we operate, software and small cell-centric disaggregation of networks via O-RAN standards, instead of large macro-centric networks, allows us to take advantage of our competitive strengths, with increased access to CSPs utilizing 5G disaggregation to drive network buildout and to lower their overall operating costs. While we have an advantage within the O-RAN disaggregation market with both software modules and radio equipment based on our years of end-to-end RAN experience, we will have to continue innovation in access edge solutions, as software-only competitors such as Mavenir begin integration with commercial off-the-shelf radios and the larger incumbents such as Ericsson and Nokia invest time and resources into network disaggregation solutions.

Competing Technologies
 
Today, broadband connections can be provided with or without voice services by a number of competing access technologies. While the communications transport network and Internet backbone are capable of transporting data at extremely high speeds, data can only be delivered from those parts of the network through the access portion to the end-user as fast as the end-user’s connection to the network will permit. Many traditional access connections that use copper wires are inadequate to address the rapidly expanding bandwidth requirements. To address these requirements, a number of alternative solutions have emerged. Below we have identified those solutions that we believe, for a variety of technological and economic reasons, compete most directly with the broadband wireless solutions we offer. Rural areas generally have fewer copper and wired infrastructures in existence. For this reason, we believe we have a particular competitive edge in rural and developing markets.
 
The performance and coverage area of our wireless systems are dependent on some factors that are outside our control, including features of the environment such as the amount of clutter (natural terrain features and man-made obstructions) and the available radio frequencies. Any inability to overcome these obstacles may make our technology less competitive in comparison with other technologies and make other technologies less expensive or more suitable. Our business may also compete in the future with products and services based on other wireless technologies and other technologies that have yet to be developed.
 
Wired Digital Subscriber Lines. Broadband access is provided today by wired technologies using both copper and fiber. Copper is used most often in residential broadband access systems.
 
DSL technology improves the data transmission rate of existing copper networks. DSL transmission rates and service availability, however, are limited in all networks by both the quality of the available copper, which for many providers is a large percentage of their copper network, and by the maximum transmission distance (approximately five kilometers from the subscriber to the service provider’s switching equipment in many instances) of wired DSL technology. In many instances, a substantial portion of an operator’s copper network is unsuitable for DSL transmission.
 
Fiber technology allows an operator to deliver video, voice and data capabilities over an optical fiber medium that can deliver very high capacity to end-users. Because of the high costs associated with its deployment, fiber is used primarily for broadband access for businesses. It is most economically deployed in urban and suburban environments where business and residents create very high demand for services over broadband, and end-users can afford the relatively high tariffs charged by operators to provide fiber-based connectivity.
 
Cable Networks. Two-way cable modems using coaxial cable enable data services to be delivered over a network originally designed to provide television service to residential subscribers. Coaxial cable has greater transmission capacity than copper wires, but is often costly to upgrade for two-way data services. The data rate available to each subscriber on a cable link decreases as the number of subscribers using the link increases. Cable coverage, which is not available in many countries, may limit the growth of this segment as a broadband access medium.
 
Satellite Networks. For a variety of technological and economic reasons, satellite technologies have not presented the most direct competitive challenge to the fixed wireless access systems we offer. We believe that newer Low Earth Orbit (“LEO”) systems will eventually find a role in remote access but will be vulnerable to the spread of terrestrial broadband facilities driven in part by the need for very low latency, high speed backhaul for ubiquitous 5G networks.
 
Customers
 
Our customers are principally network operators, who provide their customers with fixed, nomadic and portable broadband solutions, as well as backhaul and bridging solutions and mobile access solutions. Our customers today can generally be described as follows:

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret law and confidentiality or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights in products, services, know-how and information. Intellectual property laws afford limited protection. Certain rights held by us and our subsidiaries may provide us with competitive advantages, even though not all of these rights are protected under intellectual property laws. It may be possible for a third party to copy our products and services or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without our permission.
 
Through the development of our products, we have generated a significant patent portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, our development efforts have resulted in 229 separate patents granted (includes U.S. patents and various foreign counterparts), with a further 68 currently pending (includes U.S. patents and foreign counterparts) applications. To improve system performance and reduce costs, we have developed custom integrated circuits that incorporate much of our intellectual property as well as a large library of AI base software modules which are key elements of our wireless solutions.
 
United States patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date a patent application is filed. Our U.S. patents have in the past given us competitive advantages in the marketplace, including a number of patents for wireless transmission techniques and antenna technologies with a particular emphasis on high speed mobility and power efficiency.
 
United States trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. We register our trademarks in a number of other countries where we do business.
 
Manufacturing
 
We subcontract all of our manufacturing to third party subcontract manufacturing service providers. These providers offer full service manufacturing solutions, including assembly, integration, test, prototyping and new product introduction. The following is an overview of where our products are manufactured.

● | Most of our 4G and 5G product families are all currently produced with Foxconn in their Vietnam facilities and some in Malaysia with Cape Manufacturing (M) Sdn. Bhd. of the Cape Group of Companies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our Mimosa product range is currently produced in Malaysia with Cape Manufacturing (M) Sdn. Bhd. of the Cape Group of Companies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We also contract with smaller contract manufacturers for early life prototyping and engineering samples.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our agreements with our manufacturing subcontractors are non-exclusive and may be terminated by either party generally on six months’ notice without significant penalty. Other than component purchase liability as a consequence of authorized forecasts we provide, we do not have any agreements with our manufacturing subcontractors to purchase any minimum volumes. Our manufacturing support activities consist primarily of prototype development, new product introduction, materials planning and procurement, functional test support and quality control. All products are routed to customers via one of our third-party logistics partners.
 
Some of the key components of our products are purchased from single vendors for which alternative sources are generally not readily available in the short to medium term. If these vendors fail to supply us with components because they do not have them in stock when we need them, if they reduce or eliminate their manufacturing capacity for these components or if they enter into exclusive relationships with other parties which prevents them from selling to us, we could experience and have experienced significant delays in shipping our products while we seek other sources. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our supply chains, adversely affecting product supply and delivery to our customers. Future pandemic induced lockdowns continue to be a risk to the supply chain. As a further consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, component lead times are extending as demand exceeds supply on certain components, including semiconductors, and have caused the costs of components to increase. This has caused us to extend our forecast horizon with our contract manufacturing partners and has increased the risk of supplier delays. We cannot at this time accurately predict what effects, or the extent, the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our 2023 operating results, due to uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, component shortages and increased component costs, the length of voluntary business closures, and governmental actions taken in response to the outbreak. More generally, the widespread health crisis has and may continue to adversely affect the global economy, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and therefore impact our results of operations and financial condition.
