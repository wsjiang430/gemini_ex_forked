ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
International Money Express, Inc. (the “Company” or “Intermex”) is a leading omnichannel money remittance services company focused primarily on the United States of America (“United States” or “U.S.”) to Latin America and the Caribbean (“LAC”) corridor, which includes Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean. In recent years, we expanded our services to allow remittances to Africa and Asia from the United States and also began offering sending services from Canada to Latin America and Africa. We utilize our proprietary technology to deliver convenient, reliable and value-added services to consumers through a broad network of sending and paying agents. Our remittance services, which include a comprehensive suite of ancillary financial processing solutions and payment services, are available in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and 13 provinces in Canada, where consumers can send money to beneficiaries in 16 LAC countries, eight countries in Africa and two countries in Asia. Our services are accessible in person through over 100,000 independent sending and paying agents and 117 Company-operated stores, as well as online and via Internet-enabled mobile devices. Additionally, our product and service portfolio include online payment options, pre-paid debit cards and direct deposit payroll cards, which may present different cost, demand, regulatory and risk profiles relative to our core money remittance business. In March 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire La Nacional and LAN Holdings, money remittance companies serving more than 70 countries. In November 2022, we completed the acquisition of La Nacional and we expect to complete the acquisition of LAN Holdings in the second quarter of 2023 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including pending regulatory approvals. The acquisition of La Nacional strengthens the Company’s presence in the Dominican Republic and other key markets in Latin America.
Money remittance services to LAC countries, mainly Mexico and Guatemala, are the primary source of our revenue. These services involve the movement of funds on behalf of an originating consumer for receipt by a designated beneficiary at a designated receiving location. Our remittances to LAC countries are primarily generated in the United States by consumers with roots in Latin American and Caribbean countries, many of whom do not have an existing relationship with a traditional full-service financial institution capable of providing the services we offer. We provide these consumers with flexibility and convenience to help them meet their financial needs. We believe many consumers who use our services may have access to traditional banking services, but prefer to use our services based on reliability, convenience and value. We generate money remittance revenue from fees paid by consumers (i.e., the senders of funds), which we share with our sending agents in the originating country and our paying agents in the destination country. Remittances paid in local currencies that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar can also generate revenue if we are successful in our daily management of currency exchange spreads.
Our money remittance services enable consumers to send funds through our broad network of locations in the United States and Canada that are primarily operated by third-party businesses, as well as through our Company-operated stores located in the United States. Transactions are processed and payment is collected by our agent (“sending agent(s)”) and those funds become available for pickup by the beneficiary at the designated destination, usually within minutes, at any Intermex payer location (“paying agent(s)”). We refer to our sending agents and our paying agents collectively as agents. In addition, our services are offered digitally through Intermexonline.com and via Internet-enabled mobile devices. Since January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, we have grown our agent network by approximately 27.3% and increased our principal amount sent by more than 21.2% to $21.0 billion. In 2022, we processed approximately 47.8 million remittances, representing over 19.2% growth in transactions as compared to 2021.
Our Competitive Strengths
•Primary focus on the LAC corridor. Unlike many of our competitors, who we believe prioritize global reach over growth and profitability, we are focused on a few geographical regions in which there is a concentration of a significant portion of the world’s money remittance volume. We believe the LAC corridor provides an attractive operating environment with significant opportunity for future growth. According to the latest available data published by the World Bank, the LAC corridor continues to be the most rapidly growing remittance corridor in the world.
•Highly scalable, proprietary software platform. We provide our money remittance services utilizing our internally developed proprietary software systems, which we believe enhance the productivity of our network of sending agents, enabling them to quickly, reliably and cost-effectively process remittance transactions. Our proprietary software systems were designed to incorporate real-time compliance functionality, which improves our regulatory compliance and helps to minimize fraud. We have developed a platform that has the capacity to handle traffic well in excess of the number of transactions we currently process. Our money remittance platform has proven reliable, with our 2022 downtime being less than 0.05%.
•Highly selective sending agent recruitment process designed to identify productive long-term partners. We strategically target sending agents for our network only after a metric-based analysis of potential productivity and a thorough vetting process. In our sending agent selection process, we focus on geographic locations that we believe are likely to have high customer volume and demand for our services. By closely monitoring individual sending agent performance and money remittance trends, we can offer our sending agents real-time technical support and marketing assistance to help increase their productivity and remittance volume.
Index

•Strong relationships with major banks and financial institutions. Our relationships with clearing, check processing, trading and exchange rate and cash management banks are critical to an efficient and reliable remittance network. We benefit from our strong and long-term relationships with a number of large banks and financial institutions. We maintain strong relationships with a number of other national and regional banking and financial institutions in the United States, Canada and Latin America. For example, we have maintained a long-term relationship with Wells Fargo, Bank of America and US Bank, among others. Due to increasing regulatory scrutiny of banks and financial institutions, we believe that new banking relationships may be difficult to develop for new, start-up competitors in the industry, hence creating a barrier to entry to new competition and making our existing relationships a competitive advantage.
•Powerful brand with strong consumer awareness and loyalty in the LAC corridor. We believe we are a leading money remittance provider from the United States to the LAC corridor, processing 21.0% of the aggregate volume of remittances to Mexico according to the latest available data published by the Central Bank of Mexico in 2022 and 29.3% of the aggregate volume of remittances to Guatemala according to the latest available data published by the Central Bank of Guatemala in 2022. We believe that consumers associate the Intermex brand with reliability, strong customer service and the ability to safely and efficiently remit their funds. The information contained in this paragraph is based on “Revenues by Workers’ Remittances” published in the Central Bank of Mexico’s website and “Income from family remittance” published in the Central Bank of Guatemala’s website.
•Strong compliance processes and procedures. We operate in a highly-regulated environment and are reviewed by regulators and external auditors periodically. We maintain a comprehensive and rigorous compliance process with policies, procedures and internal controls designed to exceed current regulatory requirements. Our software also includes embedded compliance systems that provide real-time transaction alerts and Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) screening. Our risk and compliance management tools include programs by Equifax, Experian, LexisNexis and TransUnion, among others.
•Experienced and proven management team. Our management team consists of financial services industry veterans with a track record of achieving profitable growth. Our team is led by our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and President, Robert Lisy, with a successful 30-plus year track record in the retail financial services and electronic payment processing industry.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe we are well positioned to drive continued growth by executing on the following core strategies either organically or through acquisitions of other entities:
•Expand our market share in our largest corridors. The two largest remittance corridors we serve are the United States to Mexico and United States to Guatemala. According to the latest available data in the World Bank Remittance Matrix, the United States to Mexico remittance continues to be one of the largest in the world. We aim to continue to expand our market share in those states where we are currently well-established and poised for continued profitable growth within those markets via targeted regional penetration. We believe that we can leverage our current customer data to increase repeat customer usage, track and effectively recapture one-time users of our service and improve sending agent productivity to drive growth in these states. We also execute a targeted marketing effort to realize significantly increased market share growth in large states where we are underrepresented.
•Expand our services into new corridors and emerging markets. We believe that there is significant room to grow our business in underserved geographic regions in the LAC corridor where there is demand from customers and agents for our value-added approach to money remittances. Specifically, we are targeting future growth opportunities via new corridors from the United States to other non-Spanish speaking regions, including the Caribbean and other continents. In recent years, we expanded our services to allow remittances to Africa and Asia from the United States and also began offering sending services from Canada to Latin America and Africa. Our acquisition of La Nacional further strengthens our presence in Latin America.
•Continue to grow online and mobile remittance channels. Our money remittance platform currently enables consumers to send funds from the United States to the LAC corridor and Africa through the Internet via Intermexonline.com and on their Internet-enabled mobile devices. We have and continue to make significant investments in enhancing our digital mobile money remittance applications to provide consumers with safe, easy-to-use features for remitting funds. We believe these channels not only expand our potential customer base as digital transaction capabilities become more relevant to LAC corridor consumers but also benefit from secular and demographic trends as consumers continue to migrate to conducting financial transactions online.
•Leverage our technology in the business-to-business market. We believe that our money remittance platform has significant excess capacity. We believe we can leverage this capacity to sell business-to-business solutions to third parties, such as banks and major retailers.

Segments
Our business is organized around one reportable segment that provides money remittance services primarily between the U.S. and Canada to Mexico, Guatemala and other countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia through a network of authorized agents located in various unaffiliated retail establishments and 117 Company-operated stores throughout the U.S. and Canada. This is based on the objectives of the business and how our chief operating decision maker, the CEO and President, monitors operating performance and allocates resources.
Operations and Services
Money remittance services to LAC countries, primarily Mexico and Guatemala, are the primary source of our revenue. These services involve the movement of funds on behalf of an originating consumer for receipt by a designated beneficiary at a designated receiving location. Our remittances to LAC countries are primarily generated in the United States by consumers with roots in Latin American and Caribbean countries, many of whom do not have an existing relationship with a traditional full-service financial institution capable of providing the services we offer. We provide these consumers with flexibility and convenience to help them meet their financial needs. We believe many consumers who use our services may have access to traditional banking services, but prefer to use our services based on reliability, convenience and value. We generate money remittance revenue from fees paid by consumers (i.e., the senders of funds), which we share with our sending agents in the originating country and our paying agents in the destination country. Remittances paid in local currencies that are not pegged to the U.S. dollar also earn revenue through our daily management of currency exchange spreads.
The majority of our money remittance transactions are generated through our agent network of retail locations and Company-operated stores where the transaction is processed and payment is collected by our sending agent. Those funds become available for pickup by the beneficiary at the designated receiving destination, usually within minutes, at any Intermex payer location. In select countries, the designated recipient may also receive the remitted funds via a deposit directly to the recipient’s bank account, mobile device account or prepaid card. Our locations in the United States and Canada, also referred to as our sending agents, tend to be individual establishments, such as multi-service stores, grocery stores, convenience stores, bodegas and other retail locations. Our payers in LAC countries are referred to as paying agents, and generally consist of large banks and financial institutions or large retail chains. Grupo Elektra, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Elektra”) is our largest paying agent and processes a significant portion of remittances in the LAC corridor. Each of our sending agents and our paying agents are primarily operated by third-party businesses where our money remittance services are offered. Additionally, we operate a number of retail locations in the United States, which we refer to as Company-operated stores and where our money remittance services are available. We also operate subsidiary payer networks in Mexico under the Pago Express brand and in Guatemala under the Intermex brand. These networks contribute payer locations that reach some of the most remote areas in those countries, providing increased convenience to consumers in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Guatemala.
At sending agent locations, consumers may initiate a transaction directly with an agent, or through a direct-dialed telephone conversation from the agent location to our call centers. Many of our sending agents operate in locations that are open outside of traditional banking hours, including nights and weekends. Our sending agents understand the markets that they serve and coordinate with our sales and marketing teams to develop business plans for those markets. We hold promotional events for our sending agents to help familiarize them with the Intermex brand and to incent the agents to promote our services to consumers.
Our money remittance services are also available on the Internet via Intermexonline.com, enabling consumers to send money twenty-four hours a day conveniently from their computer or Internet-enabled mobile device. Those funds can be sent to any of our paying agent locations or to a recipient’s bank account, funding the transaction using debit card, credit card, or through electronic funds transfer processed through the automated clearing house (“ACH”) payment system. Although our internet-based money transmission services have grown significantly in 2022, they still do not constitute a material percentage of the Company’s overall business. 
Also, our enhanced digital mobile money remittance application provides consumers with safe, easy-to-use features for remitting funds with a debit or credit card, or ACH transfer. Consumers are able to select a variety of sending methods, including cash pickup at thousands of locations, direct deposit into bank accounts, debit cards, mobile wallets, and home delivery in selected markets.
We maintain call centers in Mexico and Guatemala, providing call center services 365 days per year and customer service in English, French and Spanish, as well as the possibility of service in many of the regional dialects that our customers speak. Our call centers are able to provide customer service for inbound customer calls and have technology available for direct calls from customers at our agent locations in processing remittance transactions.
Cash Management Bank Relationships
We buy and sell a number of global currencies and maintain a network of settlement accounts to facilitate the timely funding of money remittances and foreign exchange trades. Our relationships with clearing, check processing, trading and exchange rate and cash management banks are critical to an efficient and reliable remittance network. We benefit from our strong and long-term relationships with a number of large banks and financial institutions. We maintain strong relationships with a number of other national and regional banking 
Index

and financial institutions in the United States, Canada and Latin America. In addition, we have benefited from our long relationship with US Bank, which manages our main operating account, and from strong relationships with PNC Global Transfer, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and KeyBank as our primary banks for exchange rate management with respect to the foreign currencies.
Information Technology
Currently, all of our money processing software is proprietary and has been developed primarily by our internal software development team. Our money processing software acts as a point of sale for our money remittance transactions and incorporates real-time compliance functionality, which improves our regulatory compliance and helps to minimize fraud. Our money processing software is critical to our operations while our back-office software is critical for settling our transactions.
Also, our money remittance platform enables consumers to send funds through the Internet via Intermexonline.com and on their Internet-enabled mobile devices and our enhanced digital mobile money remittance application provides consumers with safe, easy-to-use features for remitting funds.
In addition to our money remittance software, digital platform and mobile application, we continue to develop programs and defenses against cyber-attacks. We are fully aligned with the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework, which is a voluntary framework that most companies in the financial services industry follow. We utilize a number of third-party vendors that monitor our systems and inform us of any attempted attacks. Our Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer report periodically to our board of directors regarding our cybersecurity policies and practices.
In addition to our proprietary and internally developed software systems, we have analytical data that enable us to analyze market trends, performance of market territories, agent performance and consumer habits in real time.
We continually invest in our technology platform that has the capacity to handle traffic well in excess of the number of transactions we currently process. A load balancing configuration between tier-1 datacenters, in addition to failover redundancy, provides uptime performance. Our technology platform has experienced limited downtime, with our 2022 downtime being less than 0.05%.
Our Transaction Processing Engine (“TPE”) allows us to process money remittances reliably and quickly by leveraging a proprietary rules engine to apply granular-level product feature customization. The TPE also leverages real-time risk management algorithms to improve our regulatory compliance and helps to minimize fraud.
Our internally developed and proprietary payer Application Programming Interface platform securely and efficiently integrates our TPE directly with the platforms of our paying agents, so that we can deliver money remittances quickly to our paying agents while optimizing the efficiency/speed of adding new payers to our network and integrating payers’ software and systems with our software and systems.
Intellectual Property
The Intermex brand is critical to our business. In the markets in which we compete, we derive benefit from our brand, as we believe the Intermex brand is recognized for its speed, cost effectiveness and reliability for money remittances throughout the United States, the LAC corridor, Canada and Africa. We use various trademarks and service marks in our business, including, but not limited, to Intermex, International Money Express, IntermexDirect, CheckDirect, La Nacional and Pago Express, some of which are registered in the United States and other countries. In addition, we rely on trade secret protection to protect certain proprietary rights in our information technology. See the section entitled “Information Technology” for more information.
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright laws and trade secret protection and invention assignment, confidentiality or license agreements to protect our intellectual property rights in products, services, expertise, and information. We believe the intellectual property rights in processing equipment, computer systems, software and business processes held by us and our subsidiaries provide us with a competitive advantage. We take appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property to the extent such intellectual property can be protected.
Sales and Marketing
The majority of our money remittance transactions are generated through our agent network of retail locations and Company-operated stores where the transaction is processed and payment is collected by our sending agent or store. Sending agent locations include multi-service stores, grocery stores, convenience stores, bodegas and other retail locations. The vast majority of our sending agents are provided access to our proprietary money remittance software systems, while others have access to our combination telephone and fax/tablet set up, which we call telewire, enabling direct access to our call centers for money remittance services. In all of our independent sending agent locations the agent provides the physical infrastructure and staff required to complete the remittances, while we provide the central operating functions, such as transaction processing, settlement, marketing support, compliance training and support, and customer 
Index

relationship management. We also maintain 117 Company-operated stores in the United States. We retain customer data, which enables us to increase repeat customer usage, track and effectively recapture one-time users of our service and improve sending agent productivity.
We market our services to consumers in a number of ways, directly and indirectly through our sending agents and paying agents, promotional activities, traditional media and digital advertising, and our loyalty program, which we call “Interpuntos”. This loyalty program offers consumers faster service at our sending agent locations and the ability to earn points with each transaction that are redeemable for rewards, such as reduced transaction fees or more favorable foreign exchange rates.
Our Industry
We are a rapidly growing and leading money remittance service company primarily focused on the United States to the LAC corridor. We utilize our proprietary technology to deliver convenient, reliable and value-added services to consumers through a broad network of sending and paying agents. The two largest remittance corridors we serve are United States to Mexico and United States to Guatemala. According to the latest information available from the World Bank Remittance Matrix, the United States to Mexico remittance corridor was the largest in the world in 2021.
Trends in the cross-border money remittance business tend to correlate to immigration trends, global economic opportunity and related employment levels in certain industries such as construction, information technology, manufacturing, agriculture and hospitality, as well as other service industries.
Worldwide political and economic conditions continue to exhibit instability, as evidenced by high unemployment rates in key Latin American markets, restricted lending activity, higher inflation, volatility in foreign currencies and low consumer confidence, some of which reflect residual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions, among other economic and market factors. Specifically, continued political and economic unrest in Mexico, Guatemala and some countries in South America contributed to volatility. Our business has generally been resilient during times of economic instability as money remittances are essential to many recipients, with the funds used by the receiving parties for their daily needs; however, long-term sustained appreciation of the Mexican peso or Guatemalan quetzal as compared to the U.S. dollar could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.
Another significant trend impacting the money remittance industry is increasing regulation on banks, making it difficult for money remittance companies to have strong banking relationships. Regulations in the United States and elsewhere focus, in part, on cybersecurity and consumer protection. Regulations require money remittance providers, banks and other financial institutions to develop systems to prevent, detect, monitor and report certain transactions. In coming periods, we expect these and future regulatory requirements will continue to result in changes to certain of our business and administrative practices and may result in increased costs.
Government Regulation
As a non-bank financial institution in the United States, we are regulated by the Department of Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the Department of Banking and Finance of the State of Florida and the equivalent regulatory authorities in all of the other states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, in which we hold an operating money transmission license. We are duly registered as a Money Services Business (“MSB”) with FinCEN, the financial intelligence unit of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. We are also subject to a wide range of regulations in the United States and other countries, including: minimum capital or capital adequacy requirements; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; financial services regulations; currency control regulations; anti-bribery laws; money transfer and payment instrument licensing laws; escheatment laws; privacy, data protection and information security laws, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”); and consumer disclosure and consumer protection laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”).
Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened supervision of money remittance providers and requiring increased efforts to ensure compliance. Failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services, as well as the potential imposition of civil fines and possibly criminal penalties, including suspension or cancellation of an affected license. We continually monitor and enhance our compliance programs to stay current and compliant with legal and regulatory changes.
Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorism Financing and Sanctions Compliance
Our money remittance services are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations of the United States, including the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as well as state laws and regulations and the anti-money laundering laws and regulations in many of the countries in which we operate. The countries in which we operate may require one or more of the following:
•reporting of large cash transactions and suspicious activity;
Index

•transaction screening against government watch-lists, including the sanctions list maintained by OFAC;
•prohibition of transactions in, to or from certain countries, governments, individuals and entities;
•limitations on amounts that may be transferred by a consumer or from a jurisdiction at any one time or over specified periods of time, which require aggregation over multiple transactions;
•consumer information gathering and reporting requirements;
•consumer disclosure requirements, including language requirements and foreign currency restrictions;
•notification requirements as to the identity of contracting agents, governmental approval of contracting agents or requirements and limitations on contract terms with our agents; and
•registration or licensing of us or our agents with a state or federal agency in the United States or with the central bank or other proper authority in a foreign country.
Anti-money laundering regulations are constantly evolving and vary from country to country. We continuously monitor our compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and implement policies and procedures to stay current with legal requirements. Our money remittance services are primarily offered through third-party agents under contract with us, but we do not directly control these agents. As a MSB, we and our agents are required to establish anti-money laundering compliance programs that include internal policies and controls; a designated compliance officer; employee training and an independent review function. We have developed an anti-money laundering training manual and a program to assist with the education of our agents and employees on the applicable rules and regulations. We also offer in-person and online training as part of our agent compliance training program, engage in various activities to enable agent oversight and have adopted compliance policies that outline key principles of our compliance program to our agents. We have developed a regulatory compliance department, under the direction of our Chief Compliance Officer, whose foremost responsibility is to monitor transactions, detect suspicious activity, maintain financial records and train our employees and agents. An independent third-party consulting firm periodically reviews our policies and procedures to ensure the efficacy of our anti-money laundering and regulatory compliance programs. Key milestones in the compliance processes include: (1) mandatory fields and identification requirements at the time the sending agents initiate a transaction; (2) the sender and receiver are screened against government-required lists (for OFAC and other purposes); (3) before the transaction is sent to the paying agent, it is screened and any flagged exceptions are sent to the compliance unit for investigation and release or rejection; and (4) the transaction is screened for limit restrictions, velocity levels, structuring and identification requirements.
In connection with, and when required by regulatory requirements, we make information available to certain U.S. federal and state, as well as certain foreign, government agencies to assist in the prevention of money laundering, terrorism financing and other illegal activities and pursuant to legal obligations and authorizations. In certain circumstances, we may be required by government agencies to deny transactions that may be related to persons suspected of money laundering, terrorism financing or other illegal activities, and it is possible that we may inadvertently deny transactions from consumers who are making legal money transfers.
Licensing. In most countries, either we or our agents are required to obtain licenses or to register with a government authority in order to offer money transfer services. Almost all states in the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, as well as certain provinces in Canada, require us to be licensed to conduct business within their jurisdictions. Licensing requirements may include requirements related to net worth, providing surety bonds and letters of credit, operational procedures, agent oversight and maintenance of reserves to cover outstanding payment obligations. Acceptable forms of such reserves will vary based on jurisdiction and the applicable regulator, but generally include cash and cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other highly rated debt instruments. Many regulators require us to file reports on a quarterly or more frequent basis to verify our compliance with their requirements. We are also subject to periodic examinations by the governmental agencies with regulatory authority over our business.
Escheatment. Unclaimed property laws of each state in the United States in which we operate, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico require us to track certain information for all of our money remittances and payment instruments and, if the funds underlying such remittances and instruments are unclaimed at the end of an applicable statutory abandonment period, require us to remit the proceeds of the unclaimed property to the appropriate jurisdiction. Applicable statutory abandonment periods range from three to seven years. We have an ongoing program designed to comply with escheatment laws as they apply to our business.
Data Privacy and Cybersecurity. We are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security, transfer, storage and disposal of personally identifiable information of our customers, agents and employees. In the United States, we are subject to various federal privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which requires that financial institutions provide consumers with privacy notices and have in place policies and procedures regarding the safeguarding of personal information. We are also subject to privacy and data breach laws of various states. 
Index

Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) imposes additional regulatory requirements and creates additional regulatory oversight over us. The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB which issues and enforces consumer protection initiatives governing financial products and services, including money remittance services, in the United States through the CFPB’s Remittance Transfer Rule. Its requirements include: a disclosure requirement to provide consumers sending funds internationally from the United States enhanced pre-transaction written disclosures, an obligation to resolve certain errors, including errors that may be outside our control, and an obligation to cancel transactions that have not been completed at a consumer’s request. As a “larger participant” in the market for international money transfers, we are subject to direct examination and supervision by the CFPB. We have modified our systems and consumer disclosures in light of the requirements of the Remittance Transfer Rule. 
In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, it is unlawful for any provider of consumer financial products or services to engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB has substantial rule making and enforcement authority to prevent unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a financial product or service. In addition, each state of the United States from time to time, may enact new laws and regulations, such as the CCPA, which creates new consumer rights relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information that is collected by businesses. We have taken the necessary steps to review, modify and implement, as needed, policies and procedures designed to comply with the CFPB’s Remittance Transfer Rule. The Company’s communications, advertising and sales practices and that of its agent network are subject to regulation by, among other things, state and federal consumer protection laws including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”). The FTC and the Federal Communications Commission have issued regulations under the TCPA that place restrictions on, among other things, unsolicited automated telephone calls or text messages to residential and wireless telephone subscribers by means of automatic telephone dialing systems and the use of prerecorded or artificial voice messages. The Company has taken steps to insulate itself from any such wrongful conduct, including conduct engaged in by its agents, by, among other things, requiring its agents to comply with the TCPA and such regulations.
Anti-Bribery Regulation. We are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) in the United States and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. These laws may impose recordkeeping and other requirements on us. We maintain a compliance program designed to comply with anti-bribery laws and regulations applicable to our business.
Risk Management
At times, we are exposed to credit risk related to receivable balances from sending agents in the money remittance process if agents do not timely make payments to us.
Through our online and electronic platforms, we also are exposed to credit risk directly from transactions that are originated through means other than cash, such as credit, debit cards and “ACH” transfers, and therefore are subject to “chargebacks” for insufficient funds or other collection impediments, such as fraud.
Given the nature of our business, we are also subject to liquidity risk as the timing of the funds to be remitted by our sending agents may extend in comparison with the timing when we make the funds available to the money transfer beneficiary in the destination country. Our current liquidity sources as well as our ability to generate free cash are mitigating factors in our liquidity management strategy. 
Our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, which exposes us to interest rate risk as a result of fluctuations on market interest rate benchmarks.
We continually monitor fraud risk, perform credit reviews before adding agents to our network and conduct periodic credit risk analyses of agents and certain other parties that we transact with directly. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, our provision for credit losses was equal to 0.5% of our total revenues.
Seasonality
We do not experience meaningful seasonality in our business. We may experience, however, increased transaction volume around certain holidays, such as Mother’s Day and the December holidays.
Competition 
The market for money remittance services is very competitive. Our competitors include a small number of large money remittance providers, financial institutions and banks as well as a large number of small niche money remittance service providers that serve select regions. We compete with larger companies, such as The Western Union Company (“Western Union”), MoneyGram International, Inc. (“MoneyGram”), Remitly Global, Inc. (“Remitly”) and Euronet Worldwide Inc. (“Euronet”), and a number of other smaller competitors. We generally compete for money remittance agents on the basis of value, service, quality, technical and operational differences, commission, and marketing efforts. As a philosophy, we sell credible solutions to agents, not discounts or higher commissions as is typical for the industry. We compete for money remittance customers on the basis of trust, convenience, service, efficiency of outlets, value,

technology and brand recognition. We believe that our ongoing investments in new products and services will help us to remain competitive in our evolving business environment, given the increasing competition from digital platform providers.
We expect to encounter increasing competition as new technologies emerge that enable customers to send and receive money through a variety of channels, but we do not expect adoption rates to be as significant in the near term for the consumer segment we serve. Regardless, we continue to innovate in the industry by differentiating our money remittance business through programs to foster loyalty among agents as well as consumers and have expanded our channels through which our services are accessed to include online and mobile offerings in preparation for consumer adoption.
Human Capital
We invest in our workforce by offering a competitive total rewards package that in addition to a salary, includes performance incentives and comprehensive benefits that are intended to be competitive in the market and focused on the needs of our employees in order to attract and retain highly qualified talent. Our incentives are primarily measurable and performance-based, and are designed to align compensation to our business strategy and goals. We have enhanced our onboarding process and plan to further enhance learning and development programs to drive quicker integration, development and higher productivity of new employees, as well as the ongoing development of team members to ensure robust recruitment and retention.
We value diversity and inclusion and strive to create a work environment where everyone feels valued and devoted to their work. As of December 31, 2022, 98.5% of our U.S. team members identified themselves as racially or ethnically diverse. Also, 63.9% of our U.S. team identified themselves as female. In 2023, we intend to continue to promote greater community involvement through philanthropic and volunteer efforts, with a focus on diversity, community improvement, and STEM programs.
