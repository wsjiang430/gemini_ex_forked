 Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of drugs to treat gastrointestinal, or GI, disorders and diseases. Since our inception, we have devoted our efforts to developing our sole product, Gimoti (metoclopramide) nasal spray, the first and only nasally-administered product indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis. On June 19, 2020, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, for Gimoti. We launched commercial sales of Gimoti in the United States in October 2020 through our commercial partner Eversana.
 Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which food in an individual’s stomach takes too long to empty resulting in a variety of serious GI symptoms and systemic metabolic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications.

Gastroparesis frequently occurs in individuals with diabetes, but is also observed in patients with prior gastric surgery, a preceding infectious illness, pseudo-obstruction, collagen vascular disorders and anorexia nervosa. In some patients with gastroparesis, no cause can be identified, which is referred to as idiopathic gastroparesis. According to the American Motility Society Task Force on Gastroparesis, the prevalence of gastroparesis is estimated to be up to 4% of the United States population. Signs and symptoms of gastroparesis may include nausea, early satiety, bloating, prolonged fullness, upper abdominal pain, vomiting and retching. Patients may experience any combination of signs and symptoms with varying degrees of severity.
Patients with diabetic gastroparesis may experience impaired glucose control due to unpredictable gastric emptying and altered absorption of orally administered hypoglycemic drugs, which may affect the severity of their signs and symptoms. Severe signs and symptoms may cause complications such as malnutrition, esophagitis, and Mallory‑Weiss tears. Gastroparesis adversely affects the lives of patients with the disease, resulting in decreased social interaction, poor work functionality, and the development of anxiety and/or depression.
 We believe nasal spray administration has the potential to provide our target population of diabetic gastroparesis patients with a preferred treatment option over the tablet formulation for several important reasons: (1) unlike metoclopramide tablets which may be absorbed erratically due to gastroparesis itself, Gimoti is designed to bypass the digestive system to allow for more predictable absorption without needing to determine if a patient’s stomach is functioning; (2) during episodes of vomiting, Gimoti may provide predictable drug absorption through the nasal mucosa; and (3) for gastroparesis patients experiencing nausea and are not wanting to swallow a pill or water, a nasal spray may be better tolerated than an oral medication.
 We are party to a commercial services agreement with Eversana, or the Eversana Agreement. Pursuant to the Eversana Agreement, Eversana commercializes and distributes Gimoti in the United States. Eversana also manages the marketing of Gimoti to targeted health care providers, as well as the sales and distribution of Gimoti within the United States. Eversana also provided a $5 million revolving credit facility, or Eversana Credit Facility, which we have fully drawn. For additional details regarding the Eversana Agreement and the Eversana Credit Facility, see “Business—Commercialization—Commercial Services and Loan Agreements with Eversana” below.
We launched commercial sales of Gimoti in late October 2020 with Eversana, and, to date, have generated modest sales, which we believe is partly because the launch occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 We have incurred losses every year since our inception. These operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with advancing Gimoti through development activities, from pre-commercialization and commercialization costs and from other general and administrative costs associated with operating our business. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until revenues from the sales of Gimoti exceed our expenses, if ever. We may never become profitable, or if we do, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a recurring basis.
 Business Strategy
Our objective is to develop and bring to market products to treat acute and chronic GI disorders that are not satisfactorily treated with current therapies and represent significant market opportunities. Our business strategy is to:
•Successfully commercialize Gimoti in the United States. Through our commercialization agreement with Eversana, we have built a commercial infrastructure to allow us to directly market Gimoti in the United States. We have engaged Eversana to utilize its internal sales organization, along with other commercial functions, for market access, marketing, distribution, and other related patient support services.
 •Further development of Gimoti with a lower dosage strength to expand our market potential. We are evaluating the design of a single dose pharmacokinetics, or PK, clinical trial of Gimoti, based on an FDA post-marketing commitment. This trial will be designed to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dosage strength of Gimoti to accommodate patients that may require further dosage adjustments, with initiation timing pending additional feedback from the FDA.
 •Seek partnerships to accelerate and maximize the potential for Gimoti. We continue to evaluate partnering opportunities with pharmaceutical companies that have established development and sales and marketing capabilities to potentially enhance and accelerate the development and commercialization of Gimoti, including the potential to explore regulatory approval outside the United States.
 •In-license or acquire additional clinical or commercial stage product candidates for the treatment of GI diseases in a capital efficient manner. We may opportunistically in-license or acquire additional programs targeting GI diseases, leveraging our prior development experience.
The Gastrointestinal Market
 The health of the GI system has a major effect on an individual’s daily activities and quality of life. A retrospective review published by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimated that in 2004 there were more than 72 million ambulatory care visits with a diagnosis of a GI disorder in the United States alone. The annual cost of these GI disorders in 2004, not including digestive cancers and viral diseases, was estimated to be greater than $114 billion in direct and indirect expenditures, including hospital, physician and nursing services as well as over-the-counter and prescription drugs.
In 2004, the total cost of GI prescription drugs in the United States was $12.3 billion, and over half of this cost ($7.7 billion) was associated with drugs prescribed for gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Peptic ulcer disease, hepatitis C, irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, and inflammatory bowel disease, or IBD, were major contributors to the remaining drug cost. Historically GI product development efforts have focused on indications with the largest patient populations such as GERD, constipation, peptic ulcers and IBS. As a result, limited innovation has occurred in other segments of the GI market, such as upper GI motility disorders, even though these disorders affect several million patients worldwide. Consequently, due to the limited treatment options available for upper GI motility disorders, we believe there is a substantial market opportunity for us to address significant unmet medical needs, initially for diabetic gastroparesis.
GI Motility Disorders
Motility disorders are some of the most common GI disorders. Motility disorders affect the orderly contractions or relaxation of the GI tract which move contents forward and prevent backward egress. This is important in the normal movement of food through the GI tract. Motility disorders are sometimes referred to as functional GI disorders to highlight that many abnormalities in stomach function can occur even when anatomic structures appear normal. Functional GI disorders affect the upper and lower GI tract and include gastroparesis, GERD, functional dyspepsia, constipation and IBS. It has been estimated by the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders that one in four people in the United States suffer from functional GI disorders, having signs and symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, bloating, decreased appetite, early satiety, swallowing difficulties, heartburn, vomiting and/or incontinence.
Gastroparesis
Gastroparesis is a debilitating, chronic condition that has a significant impact on patients’ lives. It is characterized by slow or delayed gastric emptying and evidence of gastric retention in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Muscular contractions in the stomach, which move food into the intestine, may be too slow, out of rhythm or erratic. The following graph depicts the timing associated with the emptying of solids in patients with diabetic gastroparesis compared to normal individuals:
Camilleri M. New England Journal of Medicine 2007
 The stomach is a muscular sac between the esophagus and the small intestine where the digestion of food begins. The stomach makes acids and enzymes referred to as gastric juices which are mixed with food by the churning action of the stomach muscles. Peristalsis is the contraction and relaxation of the stomach muscles to physically breakdown food and propel it forward. The crushed and mixed food is liquefied to form chyme and is pushed through the pyloric canal into the small intestine in a controlled and regulated manner.

In gastroparesis, the stomach does not perform these functions normally, causing characteristic flares of signs and symptoms that include nausea, early satiety, prolonged fullness, bloating, upper abdominal pain, vomiting and retching. As a result of these signs and symptoms, patients may limit their food and liquid intake leading to poor nutrition, dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, and have poor blood glucose control, ultimately requiring hospitalization. If left untreated or not adequately treated, gastroparesis causes significant acute and chronic medical problems, including additional diabetic complications resulting from poor glucose control.
Gastroparesis in the Hospital Setting
When patients experience a flare of their gastroparesis symptoms that cannot be adequately managed by oral medications, they may be hospitalized for hydration, parenteral nutrition, and correction of abnormal blood glucose or electrolyte levels. In this setting, intravenous metoclopramide is the first line of treatment. Typically, these diabetic patients with gastroparesis symptoms remain in the hospital until they are stabilized and able to be effectively treated with oral metoclopramide. These hospitalizations are costly and expose patients to increased risks, including hospital-acquired infections. The number of patients with gastroparesis that require hospitalization due to their disease is growing, according to a study published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology in 2008. Additionally, the study reported, from 1995 to 2004, total hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of gastroparesis increased 158%. Hospital admissions for patients with gastroparesis as the secondary diagnosis increased 136%. The average length of stay for a patient is approximately six days at an estimated cost of approximately $22,000. Compared to the other four most common upper GI admission diagnoses (GERD, gastric ulcer, gastritis and nonspecific nausea/vomiting), gastroparesis had the longest length of stay and one of the highest total charges per stay. Additionally, the study estimates that costs associated with gastroparesis as the primary or secondary diagnosis for admission exceeded $3.5 billion in 2004.
A study of patients in clinics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between January 2004 and December 2008, published in the Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, showed that patients with diabetic or post-surgical gastroparesis had significantly more emergency room visits than other gastroparesis groups. The study reinforced the view that gastroparesis constitutes a significant burden for patients and the healthcare system, with more than one-third of patients requiring hospitalization. The number of emergency room visits and annual days of inpatient treatment were comparable to patients with Crohn’s disease. The study indicated that patients received an average of 6.7 prescriptions on admission. Eighty percent of the patients identified in the University of Pittsburgh study were women. According to a study conducted by Baylor College of Medicine and published in Gastroenterology & Endoscopy in December 2017, hospitalizations for gastroparesis have risen significantly since the early 1990s. This study noted that the number of hospitalizations increased from roughly 900 in 1994 to 16,400 in 2014, with median costs climbing from $6,000 to approximately $24,500 during the period. The number of people who visited the emergency department because of gastroparesis rose from 15,549 in 2006 to 39,470 in 2014, with an average annual increase of nearly 13% over that time.
 Etiology
Gastroparesis can be a manifestation of many systemic illnesses, arise as a complication of select surgical procedures, or develop due to unknown causes. Any disease inducing neuromuscular dysfunction of the GI tract can result in gastroparesis, with diabetes being one of the leading known causes. In a 2007 study published in Current Gastroenterology Reports, 29% of gastroparesis cases were found in association with diabetes, 13% developed as a complication of surgery and 36% were due to unknown causes. According to the American Motility Society Task Force on Gastroparesis, up to 4% of the U.S. population experiences symptomatic manifestations of gastroparesis. As the incidence of diabetes rises worldwide, the prevalence of gastroparesis is expected to rise correspondingly.
The most common identified cause of gastroparesis is diabetes mellitus. The underlying mechanism of diabetic gastroparesis is unknown, though it is thought to be related in part to neuropathic changes in the vagus nerve and/or the myenteric plexus. Prolonged elevated serum glucose levels are also associated with vagus nerve damage. The vagus nerve controls the movement of food through the digestive tract and when it is damaged, movement of food through the GI tract may be abnormal. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is rapidly rising, with the Centers for Disease Control estimating that one in ten adults currently suffer from the disease. Sedentary lifestyles, poor dietary habits and a consequent rising prevalence of obesity are expected to cause this number to grow substantially. According to a study published in the Journal of Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases in July 2010, between 25% and 55% of type 1 and 15% and 30% of type 2 diabetics suffer from symptoms associated with the condition and diabetics are 29% of the total gastroparesis population.
A 2007 study published in Current Gastroenterology Reports states that approximately 36% of gastroparesis patients suffer from idiopathic gastroparesis. The development of idiopathic gastroparesis is thought to be related to loss of myenteric ganglion cells in the distal large bowel (myenteric hypoganglionosis) and reduction in the interstitial cells of Cajal, which help control contraction of the smooth muscle in the GI tract.

Post-surgical gastroparesis is a smaller subset of the total patient pool and accounts for approximately 13% of all cases of the disease, according to a 2007 study published in Current Gastroenterology Reports. Post-surgical gastroparesis is often associated with peptic ulcer surgery, bariatric procedures or esophageal procedures and is thought to result from damage/desensitization of the vagus nerve.
Prevalence
In 2019, the American Diabetes Association estimated that diabetes affects approximately 37.3 million people of all ages in the United States, equating to about 11.3% of the population. Based on prevalence data, the potential gastroparesis patient pool in the United States is approximately 12 to 16 million adults with women making up 82% of this population, according to a 2007 study published in Current Gastroenterology Reports.
There are approximately 2.3 million diabetic patients with moderate or severe gastroparesis symptoms who are seeking treatment in the United States by a health care professional, according to a study presented at the Digestive Disease Week 2013 conference in Orlando, Florida. When patients do receive treatment for gastroparesis, multiple medications are frequently used to address the individual signs and symptoms of gastroparesis. For example, patients may receive anti-emetics for nausea and vomiting and opioids for abdominal pain, which can exacerbate delayed gastric emptying in patients with gastroparesis.
 Unmet Needs in Gastroparesis Treatment
Market research and physician interviews demonstrate that existing treatment options for diabetic gastroparesis are inadequate and there is a high level of interest in effective outpatient options for managing patients with gastroparesis symptoms. The market is currently served by oral metoclopramide, intravenous metoclopramide, and the oral disintegrating tablet, or ODT, formulation of metoclopramide (Metozolv® ODT), with approximately 3.0 million prescriptions in the United States per year, according to IMS Health (2015).
Due to the limited availability of FDA-approved treatments for gastroparesis, physicians may resort to using medications “off-label” in an attempt to address individual symptoms experienced by patients. Off-label therapies are pharmaceuticals prescribed by physicians for an unapproved indication or in an unapproved age group, unapproved dose or unapproved form of administration. Examples of drugs used without FDA approval in gastroparesis include erythromycin and Botox® injected via endoscopic procedure directly into the lower gastric sphincter. Previously-approved drugs, such as cisapride and tegaserod, are no longer commercially available in the United States because of safety concerns. Domperidone has never been approved by FDA but is obtained through certain compounding pharmacies for individual patients under special FDA usage rules.
 Gimoti is a non-oral, promotility and anti-emetic treatment that we believe has the potential to significantly improve the standard of care for gastroparesis patients. With Gimoti being approved for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis, patients and physicians now have access to an outpatient therapy that could be administered and absorbed even when patients are experiencing delayed gastric emptying or nausea and vomiting.
Our Solution: Gimoti (Metoclopramide) Nasal Spray
 We developed Gimoti, a dopamine antagonist / mixed 5-HT3 antagonist / 5-HT4 agonist with promotility and anti-emetic effects, for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis. For over 40 years, the only FDA approved products for the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis had been an oral tablet and injection formulations of metoclopramide. Gimoti is a novel formulation of metoclopramide offering systemic delivery by nasal spray administration.
We developed the nasal formulation of metoclopramide to provide our targeted patient population with acute or recurrent symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis with a product that can be systemically delivered as an alternative to the oral or intravenous routes of administration. Nasal delivery is possible because the mucosa of the nasal cavity is a single epithelial cell layer which is well‑vascularized and allows metoclopramide molecules to be transferred directly to the systemic circulation. There is no first pass liver metabolism required prior to onset of action. Since gastroparesis is a disease that halts or slows the movement of the contents of the stomach to the small intestine, oral drug administration is often compromised. The nasal formulation may also provide a predictable and consistent means of delivering metoclopramide in patients with delayed gastric emptying and/or frequent vomiting. Also, unlike the oral tablet formulation of metoclopramide, we believe that Gimoti may be tolerated even when patients are experiencing nausea.
A nasal spray formulation of metoclopramide offers an alternative route of administration for patients with severe symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis receiving the parenteral formulation of metoclopramide. Following hospitalization for intravenous metoclopramide, a nasal spray formulation would also provide a non-oral option for the transition to an outpatient treatment.
Future Clinical Trials
 We are evaluating the design of a single dose pharmacokinetics, or PK, clinical trial of Gimoti, based on an FDA post-marketing commitment. This trial will be designed to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dosage strength of Gimoti to accommodate patients that may require further dosage adjustments, with initiation timing pending additional feedback from the FDA.
 Commercialization
We are commercializing Gimoti in the United States through our partnership with Eversana. Our strategy is to establish Gimoti as the prescription product of choice for diabetic gastroparesis. Gimoti is initially being marketed to gastroenterologists, internal medicine specialists, primary care physicians and select health care providers. We have engaged Eversana to utilize its internal sales organization, along with additional commercial functions, for market access, marketing, distribution, and other related patient support services.
Commercial Services and Loan Agreements with Eversana
On January 21, 2020, we entered into the Eversana Agreement for the commercialization of Gimoti. Pursuant to the Eversana Agreement, Eversana commercializes and distributes Gimoti in the United States. Eversana also manages the marketing of Gimoti to targeted health care providers, as well as the sales and distribution of Gimoti in the United States.
 Under the terms of the Eversana Agreement, we maintain ownership of the Gimoti NDA, as well as legal, regulatory, and manufacturing responsibilities for Gimoti. Eversana will utilize its internal sales organization, along with other commercial functions, for market access, marketing, distribution and other related patient support services. We will record sales for Gimoti and retain more than 80% of net product profits once the parties’ costs are reimbursed. As of December 31, 2022, unreimbursed commercialization costs to Eversana were approximately $48.4 million. Such costs will generally be payable only as net product profits are recognized. Eversana will receive reimbursement of its commercialization costs pursuant to an agreed upon budget and a percentage of product profits in the mid-to-high teens. Net product profits are the net sales (as defined in the Eversana Agreement) of Gimoti, less (i) reimbursed commercialization costs, (ii) manufacturing and administrative costs set at a fixed percentage of net sales, and (iii) third party royalties. During the term of the Eversana Agreement, Eversana agreed to not market, promote, or sell a competing product in the United States.
On February 1, 2022, the Eversana Agreement was amended to extend the term from June 19, 2025 (five years from the date the FDA approved the Gimoti NDA) to December 31, 2026, unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. This amendment also increased the percentage of net product profit retained by us and increased the proportion of costs that are reimbursed to Eversana to the extent Eversana has accumulated unreimbursed costs. We further amended the Eversana Agreement in November 2022 to provide the preexisting rights of both parties to terminate the agreement within 30 days of the first three annual anniversaries of commercial launch, if net sales of Gimoti did not meet certain annual thresholds, would be modified solely for 2022 such that either party could terminate the agreement by written notice to the other party by November 30, 2022. Neither party terminated the agreement by November 30, 2022.
 Upon expiration or termination of the agreement, we will retain all profits from product sales and assume all corresponding commercialization responsibilities. Except as provided above with respect to 2022, within 30 days after each of the first three annual anniversaries of commercial launch, either party may terminate the agreement if net sales of Gimoti do not meet certain annual thresholds. Either party may terminate the agreement: for the material breach of the other party, subject to a 60-day cure period; in the event an insolvency, petition of the other party is pending for more than 60 days; upon 30 days written notice to the other party if Gimoti is subject to a safety recall; if the other party is in breach of certain regulatory compliance representations under the agreement; if we discontinue the development or production of Gimoti; if the net profit is negative for any two consecutive calendar quarters beginning with the first full calendar quarter 24 months following commercial launch; if the cumulative net product profits fail to reach certain thresholds in the first three years following launch; or if there is a change in applicable laws that makes operation of the services as contemplated under the agreement illegal or commercially impractical. Either party may also terminate the Eversana Agreement upon a change of control of our ownership. In the event that we initiate such termination, we shall pay to Eversana a one-time payment equal to all of Eversana’s unreimbursed costs plus a portion of Eversana’s commercialization costs incurred in the 12 months prior to termination. Such payment amount would be reduced by the amount of previously reimbursed commercialization costs and profit split paid for the related prior twelve-month period and any revenue which occurred prior to the termination yet to be collected. If Eversana initiates such a termination, none of the unreimbursed commercialization costs incurred by Eversana will be due from Evoke. If Eversana terminates the agreement due to an uncured material breach by us, or if we terminate the Eversana Agreement in certain circumstances, we have agreed to reimburse Eversana for its unreimbursed commercialization costs for the prior twelve-month period and certain other costs. In addition, Eversana may terminate the Eversana Agreement if we withdraw Gimoti from the market for more than 90 days.

In connection with the Eversana Agreement, we and Eversana have entered into the Eversana Credit Facility, pursuant to which Eversana agreed to provide a revolving credit facility of up to $5 million to us upon FDA approval of the Gimoti NDA, as well as certain other customary conditions. The Eversana Credit Facility terminates on June 19, 2025, unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. The Eversana Credit Facility is secured by all of our personal property other than our intellectual property. Under the terms of the Eversana Credit Facility, we cannot grant an interest in our intellectual property to any other person. Each loan under the Eversana Credit Facility will bear interest at an annual rate equal to 10.0%, with such interest due at the end of the loan term. In June 2020 we borrowed $2 million and in December 2020 we borrowed the remaining $3 million under the Eversana Credit Facility.
 We may prepay any amounts borrowed under the Eversana Credit Facility at any time without penalty or premium. The maturity date of all amounts, including interest, borrowed under the Eversana Credit Facility will be 90 days after the expiration or earlier termination of the Eversana Agreement. The Eversana Credit Facility also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which provide Eversana with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the loans under the Eversana Credit Facility, including our cash. These events of default include, among other things, our failure to pay any amounts due under the Eversana Credit Facility, an uncured material breach of the representations, warranties and other obligations under the Eversana Credit Facility, the occurrence of insolvency events and the occurrence of a change in control.
Gimoti Product Launch
 The U.S. launch of Gimoti occurred in October 2020 through our commercial partner Eversana and its specialty pharmacy services. In February 2022, Eversana began to transition these services to vitaCare Prescription Services, or vitaCare, a technology and services platform that helps physicians electronically prescribe Gimoti and helps patients navigate key access and adherence barriers for brand medications, and Thrifty White, a leading specialty pharmacy. Starting in July 2022, vitaCare was the sole prescription intake system used for Gimoti. The platform offers a seamless path for filling a prescription, helps patients understand coverage and identify available savings opportunities, and facilitates communications between providers and payors.
The commercial strategy has focused on educating targeted healthcare professionals, or HCPs, that are predominately gastroenterologists, about the clinical benefits of Gimoti. To date, the majority of prescriptions that have been enrolled in our patient reimbursement and distribution system have come from gastroenterologists. As of December 31, 2022, Eversana had 27 Gimoti dedicated sales representatives located throughout the U.S. In addition to the field sales team, Eversana telemarketing representatives field inbound calls and contact targeted physicians outside of the currently covered geographies. Sales representatives are communicating the benefits of Gimoti to HCP's, and vitaCare manages prescription fulfillment. Gimoti is also being promoted through social media and digital promotion through patient support groups and other online resources.
HCP feedback regarding Gimoti has generally been positive. We believe this is due to the fact that patients diagnosed with gastroparesis have delayed gastric emptying resulting in unpredictable absorption of oral medications. The only products currently approved to treat diabetic gastroparesis in an outpatient setting are Gimoti and oral metoclopramide. This limited choice of treatments has led to notable interest in Gimoti. Because Gimoti is absorbed through the nasal passage and bypasses the potential issues associated with oral absorption, physicians have noted that Gimoti is appropriate for many of their patients. The primary messaging to physicians about the benefits of a non-oral treatment for diabetic gastroparesis remains the focus of our marketing strategy.
 Gimoti also benefits from government program access initiatives. Certain Medicare Part D plans and Medicaid programs have begun to include Gimoti on their formularies. These access points allow HCPs to prescribe Gimoti to patients covered under these government programs and for Evoke’s specialty pharmacy partners to seek reimbursement under those programs. Because no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drugs exists among third-party payors in the U.S., coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor, including government healthcare programs and commercial payors.
 Manufacturer Support/Co-pay Program
 The vitaCare prescription program offers benefits verification support and provides co-pay assistance to eligible patients. Co-pay assistance is available to commercially insured and cash paying patients, and varies in amount based on the patient’s insurance plan. Government insured patients are not eligible for co-pay assistance due to legal restrictions.
Market Research
 During June 2022, Eversana conducted an ATU (Awareness, Trial, and Usage) study, a quantitative survey to measure HCP awareness, trial, and product usage, for Gimoti. Responses from 142 HCPs were captured in June 2022. Survey respondents

were split into the following groups: target gastroenterologists (n = 65); non-targeted gastroenterologists (n = 21); target PCPs (n= 20); and gastroenterologist-affiliated PAs/NPs (n = 36).
 
Key findings for the ATU study to measure HCP awareness, trial and product usage for Gimoti show that overall, 87% of all respondents indicated an intent to prescribe Gimoti. This includes 88% of target gastroenterologists, 86% of non-targeted gastroenterologists, 80% of target PCPs, and gastroenterologist-affiliated 92% of PAs/NPs.
 
Additionally, during October 2022, Eversana conducted an ATU study to measure patient awareness, trial, and product usage for Gimoti. Approximately 201 total patient responses were captured in October 2022. Survey respondents were split into groups drawn from non-diabetic (n = 50), type 1 diabetic (n = 26), and type 2 diabetic (n = 125), Areas of interest that were queried included diagnosis and experience, gastroparesis awareness, and treatments, usage and experience.
Key findings from the ATU study to measure patient awareness, trial, and product usage for Gimoti included:
 •Patients reported a wide collection of issues associated with the disease;
 •Besides diabetes, [A3] the top comorbidities were GERD, Chronic Pain/ Acute Pain , and Anxiety;
 •Patients reported taking an average of  between 6.3 to 9.1 medications each day, most of which were oral;
 •Patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes reported stomach pain as their top flare intensifying symptom and an average of 26.8 flares per year and 10.6 flares per year, respectively; and
 •Patients reported 2.0 to 3.1 ER visits; 1.9 to 2.1 Urgent Care visits and 2.1 to 3.2 Hospital visits per year.

Gimoti scored better or equal on all treatment experience measurements (symptom improvements, side effects, ease of taking medication) than all other comparators (oral metoclopramide, liquid metoclopramide, domperidone and Motegrity).
 •Gimoti 4.6 out of 7 for symptom improvement
 •Gimoti 4.1 out of 7 for side effects
 •Gimoti 5.0 out of 7 for ease of taking medication
 
Gimoti scored better in treating nausea and abdominal pain than all other comparators (oral metoclopramide, liquid metoclopramide, domperidone and Motegrity). Gimoti was the only product for which all respondents reported symptom improvement. In contrast, approximately 23 to 32% of respondents reported “no symptom improvement" with oral metoclopramide, liquid metoclopramide, domperidone or Motegrity.
 
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of Gimoti, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, drug substance and finished product for our product development and clinical trials. We currently use a third-party consultant, which we engage on an as-needed, hourly basis, to manage product development and manufacturing contractors.
 In November 2017, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher, Inc., pursuant to which Patheon has agreed to manufacture commercial quantities of Gimoti. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to purchase a certain percentage of our requirements for our Gimoti product intended for commercial sale, provided certain terms and conditions are met. The initial term of the agreement commenced in November 2017 and will continue in effect until December 31, 2025. This initial term shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless either party provides written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement upon notice within a specified time prior to the end of the then current term. Either party may terminate the agreement effective immediately upon written notice to the other in the event that (i) the other party dissolves, is declared insolvent or bankrupt by a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) a voluntary petition of bankruptcy is filed in any court of competent jurisdiction, or (iii) the agreement is assigned for the benefit of creditors. We may terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice if any governmental or regulatory authority, including, but not limited to, FDA, takes any action, or raises any objection, that prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing, or selling Gimoti. Patheon or we may terminate the agreement upon specified prior written notice to the other party if Patheon or we, as applicable, assigns any of our rights under the agreement to an assignee that is (i) not a credit worthy substitute for the assigning party; or (ii) a competitor of assigning party. Moreover, either party may terminate the agreement upon written notice to the other party where the other party has failed to remedy a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, or other obligations

under the agreement within a specified period of time following receipt of a written notice of the breach, subject to specified terms and conditions.
 In May 2016, we entered into a Master Supply Agreement with Cosma S.p.A., or Cosma, pursuant to which Cosma will be the exclusive commercial supplier of metoclopramide for the manufacture of Gimoti. Under the supply agreement, Cosma will supply metoclopramide pursuant to purchase orders which we may deliver to Cosma from time to time, and there is no minimum supply requirement. In the event Cosma discontinues supply of metoclopramide for any reason, including by reason of a force majeure event, or materially changes the metoclopramide specifications, then we may require Cosma to supply up to a two years’ supply of the metoclopramide based on our purchase orders over the preceding two years. The term of the supply agreement is three years, which term shall be automatically extended (1) for an additional period equivalent to the time elapsing from May 2016 to the date of the first commercial launch of Gimoti and (2) for successive one-year periods thereafter, unless terminated earlier. Either party may terminate the supply agreement on 180 days’ written notice to the other party or on a 30 days’ written notice to the other party for such party’s material uncured breach.
 Competition
 The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, coverage pricing and reimbursement.
Many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.
Gimoti competes directly with metoclopramide oral, erythromycin and domperidone as a treatment for gastroparesis. Metoclopramide is the only product currently approved in the United States to treat gastroparesis. Metoclopramide is available from a number of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as in branded form in the United States under the tradename Reglan® Tablets from Ani Pharmaceuticals.
Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. launched an orally dissolving tablet formulation of metoclopramide in 2009. Other programs in the gastroparesis pipeline include new chemical entities in earlier-stage clinical trials. In addition to Gimoti, we are aware of the following development candidates, all of which are in clinical development.
Gastroparesis Treatment Development Pipeline


Product | Class | Route | Company | Status 
Tradipitant | NK-1 antagonist | oral | Vanda | Phase 3
Velusetrag | 5-HT4 receptor agonist | oral | Theravance/Alfasigma | Phase 2
Metopimazine | D2/D3 antagonist | oral | Neurogastrx | Phase 2
CIN-102 | Deuterated Domperidone | oral | CinRx | Phase 2
TAK-906 | D2/D3 antagonist | oral | Takeda/Altos | Phase 2

 Tradipitant is a NK-1 antagonist that has been tested in various other indications by Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. A Phase 3 clinical trial completed enrollment in the second half of 2021, and in January 2022 Vanda reported that the trial did not meet its primary endpoint.
 Velusetrag, also called TAK-954, is a 5-HT4 receptor agonist compound under development for the treatment of gastroparesis by Theravance Biopharma, Inc., in collaboration with Alfasigma S.p.A. In August 2018, Theravance announced that its Phase 2 study failed to reach statistical significance in the two higher doses tested, but did show statistical significance in the lower dose tested.
Metopimazine, a selective and peripherally restricted dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist to treat gastroparesis, is being developed by Neurogastrx. It is approved in countries outside the U.S. in other indications.


CIN-102 is a dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist that is a deuterated version of Domperidone being developed by CinRx to treat gastroparesis. Domperidone is a product approved outside the U.S. that was in clinical trials in the U.S., but has not received FDA approval to date. A 60-person Phase 2 trial has been initiated with an estimated completion of the trial in March 2021. In January 2022, CinRx reported a cardiac safety trial was successfully completed.
 TAK-906 is a dopamine D2/D3 receptor antagonist being developed by Takeda to treat gastroparesis. A 205-person Phase 2 trial has been initiated with an estimated completion of the trial in July 2021.
 One additional medication, Motilium (domperidone), a dopamine receptor modulator, is not FDA-approved, but is available in the United States through various compounding pharmacies under a specific FDA restricted-access program. The safety and efficacy of Motilium as a promotility agent is not fully established.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
Overview
We are building an intellectual property portfolio for Gimoti in the United States and abroad. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidate, its methods of use and processes for its manufacture, and for other technologies, where appropriate. Our policy is to actively seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and abroad relating to proprietary technologies that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology.
Our business success will depend significantly on our ability to:
•secure, maintain and enforce patent and other proprietary protection for our core technologies, inventions and know-how; 
 •obtain and maintain licenses to key third-party intellectual property owned by such third parties; 
 •preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and 
 •operate without infringing upon valid, enforceable third-party patents and other rights.
 Patent Portfolio
 Our patent portfolio consists of patents and patent applications, including the following U.S. patents and patent applications as of December 31, 2022:
•U.S. Patents 8,334,281 and 11,020,361 —Nasal Formulations of Metoclopramide. These patents are expected to expire no earlier than December 22, 2029 and have four pending Continuation applications (U.S. Non-Provisional Patent Application No. 17/100,664 (allowed by USPTO November 28, 2022); 17/366,818; 17/366,829; and 17/366,839). 
 •U.S. Non-Provisional Patent Application No. 17/381,464 – Treatment of Symptoms Associated with Female Gastroparesis. If granted, this patent is not expected to expire earlier than 2032.
 •U.S. Patent 11,517,545 – Treatment of Moderate and Severe Gastroparesis. This patent is expected to expire no earlier than 2038 and have one pending Continuation application (U.S. Non-Provisional Patent Application No. 18/047,364).
 •U.S. Non-Provisional Patent Application No. 16/646,527 – Methods of Intranasal Metoclopramide Dosing. If granted, this patent is not expected to expire earlier than 2038.
 We have also been granted European and Canadian patents for pharmaceutical compositions comprising metoclopramide. These patents are expected to expire no earlier than 2029. We have also been granted European, Japanese, Russian and Mexican patents for the use of intranasal metoclopramide for treating diabetic gastroparesis in human females. These patents are expected to expire no earlier than 2032. Additional patent applications have been filed in the United States and abroad related to more recent clinical trial findings.
 Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidate are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics. Given the amount of time

required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.
Other Intellectual Property Rights
We currently have a registered trademark for EVOKE PHARMA and other trademarks, including GIMOTI in the United States.
Confidential Information and Inventions Assignment Agreements
We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment, consulting or collaborative relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances.
In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed by the individual during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by applicable law. Our consulting agreements also provide for assignment to us of any intellectual property resulting from services performed for us.
Technology Acquisition Agreement
In June 2007, we acquired all worldwide rights, data, patents and other related assets associated with Gimoti from Questcor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Questcor, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement. We paid Questcor $650,000 in the form of an upfront payment and $500,000 in May 2014 as a milestone payment based upon the initiation of the first patient dosing in our Phase 3 clinical trial for Gimoti. In August 2014, Mallinckrodt, plc, or Mallinckrodt, acquired Questcor. As a result of that acquisition, Questcor transferred its rights included in the asset purchase agreement with us to Mallinckrodt. In addition to the payments previously made to Questcor, we were required to make additional milestone payments totaling up to $52 million. In March 2018, we and Mallinckrodt amended the asset purchase agreement to defer development and approval milestone payments, such that rather than paying two milestone payments based on FDA acceptance for review of the NDA and final product marketing approval, we would be required to make a single $5 million payment on the one-year anniversary after we receive FDA approval to market Gimoti. At the time of the Gimoti NDA approval by FDA, we recorded the $5 million payable owed to Mallinckrodt with a due date of June 19, 2021, along with a $5 million research and development expense. The $5 million milestone payment was paid in July 2021.
 The remaining $47 million in milestone payments depended on Gimoti’s commercial success. We were required to pay to Mallinckrodt a low single digit royalty percentage on net sales of Gimoti. As of December 31, 2022, we have paid Mallinckrodt approximately $134,000 for royalties on net sales of Gimoti. Our obligation to pay such royalties and milestones terminated due to the expiration of the last patent right covering Gimoti transferred under the asset purchase agreement.
 Government Regulation
FDA Regulations
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products.
FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. The process required by FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
•completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations; 
 •submission to FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 


•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with FDA current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations, including, for devices and device components, the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •submission to FDA of an NDA; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
 Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed clinical trial protocol and other information, are submitted as part of an IND to FDA. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by FDA, unless FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
Further, an IRB covering each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and informed consent information for subjects before the trial commences at that site, and it must monitor the study until completed. FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or for failure to comply with the IRB’s or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, or FDA or IRB may impose other conditions.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Sponsors of clinical trials generally must register and report, at the National Institutes of Health-maintained website ClinicalTrials.gov, key parameters of certain clinical trials. For purposes of an NDA submission and approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
 •Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more extensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 •Phase 3: The drug is administered to a large patient population to further evaluate dosage, to obtain additional evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites, to establish the overall risk-benefit relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. 
 •Phase 4: In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. 
 The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive information relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, and proposed labeling, among other things.
Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program fees. FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to payment of additional user fees. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before FDA accepts it for filing.

Once the submission has been accepted for filing, FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under PDUFA, FDA agrees to specific performance goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Standard Review and Priority Review. Standard Review NDAs have a goal of being completed within ten months of the date of receipt by FDA (for drugs that do not contain new molecular entities) and ten months of the 60-day filing date (for drugs that contain new molecular entities). A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The goal for completing a Priority Review is six months from the date of receipt by FDA (for drugs that do not contain new molecular entities) and six months of the 60-day filing date (for drugs that contain new molecular entities). However, FDA does not always complete its review within these timelines and the review can take substantially longer.
FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, FDA may inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements, and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements before approving an NDA.
After FDA evaluates an NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that FDA has identified in the NDA, except that where FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the NDA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, FDA may approve the NDA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a medicine and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. FDA may also require one or more Phase 4 post- market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an NDA is approved, the product will be subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to drug/device listing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. FDA may also require post-approval studies and clinical trials if FDA finds that scientific data, including information regarding related drugs, deem such studies appropriate. The purpose of such studies would be to assess a known serious risk or signals of serious risk related to the drug or to identify an unexpected serious risk when available data indicate the potential for a serious risk. FDA may also require a labeling change if it becomes aware of new safety information that it believes should be included in the labeling of a drug.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

Once an approval is granted, FDA may suspend, restrict or withdraw the approval, require a product recall, or impose additional restrictions or limitations if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 •refusal of FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 In addition, FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market, and FDA imposes a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. While physicians may prescribe for off-label uses, manufacturers may only promote for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Indeed, FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FFDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing entities to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials are pre-cleared by FDA, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.
The distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is also subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution, including a drug pedigree which tracks the distribution of prescription drugs.
Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications
As an alternate path to FDA approval for modifications to formulations or uses of products previously approved by FDA, an applicant may submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA. Section 505(b)(2) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, and permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon published literature and FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness based on certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on studies conducted for a previously approved drug product, the applicant is required to certify to FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in FDA Orange Book. FDA Orange Book is where patents associated with an FDA-approved product are listed. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patent or that such patent is invalid is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. The Section 505(b)(2) NDA application also will not be accepted or approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a New Chemical Entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
If the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the referenced NDA and patent holders once the 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a legal challenge to the Paragraph IV certification. Under the FFDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the NDA and patent holders’ receipt of a Paragraph IV

certification in most cases automatically prevents FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months, or until a court decision or settlement finding that the patent is invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, whichever is earlier. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen the 30-month stay if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation. Thus, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its product only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its product may be commercialized.
The 505(b)(2) NDA applicant also may be eligible for its own regulatory exclusivity period, such as three-year exclusivity. Specifically, a product may be granted three-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity if one or more clinical studies, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. Should this occur, FDA would be precluded from making effective any other application for the same condition of use or for a change to the drug product that was granted exclusivity until after that three-year exclusivity period has expired. Additional non-patent exclusivities may also apply.
Additionally, the 505(b)(2) NDA applicant may have relevant patents in the Orange Book, and if so, it can initiate patent infringement litigation against those applicants that challenge such patents, which could result in a 30-month stay delaying those applicants.
Manufacturing Requirements
We and our third-party manufacturers must comply with applicable FDA regulations relating to cGMP, including applicable QSR requirements for the device component of Gimoti. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to, among other things, organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports, and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of FDA pursuant to a pre-approval inspection before we can use them to manufacture our products. We and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections of facilities by FDA and other authorities, including procedures and operations used in the testing and manufacture of our products to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including, among other things, warning letters, the seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties.
Insurance Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which our products are covered by third-party payors, such as commercial insurance, managed healthcare organizations and government health care programs. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for Gimoti or any of our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover Gimoti or any of our drug candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws
We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, and physician and other health care provider payment transparency laws and regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

Additionally, the False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal criminal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully making, or causing to be made, a false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining the right to any benefit or payment under a federal health care program. A violation of these laws may constitute a felony or misdemeanor and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits, among other things, the offering or transferring of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of Medicare or Medicaid payable items or services. Noncompliance with such beneficiary inducement provision of the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law can result in civil money penalties for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Physician Payment Transparency Act imposes reporting requirements on certain drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians (as defined by statute), non-physician practitioners including physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for any payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of marketing expenditures and pricing information, as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
 Government Drug Price Reporting
Medicaid is a joint federal and state program for low‑income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or MDRP, as a condition of having federal funds available for our covered outpatient drugs under Medicaid and under Medicare Part B, we have entered into an agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to pay a rebate to state Medicaid programs for each unit of our covered outpatient drugs dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary and paid for by the state Medicaid program. Medicaid rebates are based on pricing data we are required to report on a monthly and quarterly basis to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the MDRP and Medicare programs. For the MDRP, these data include the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for each drug and, in the

case of innovator products, the Best Price, which represents the lowest price available from the manufacturer to any wholesaler, retailer, provider, health maintenance organization, nonprofit entity, or governmental entity in the United States in any pricing structure, calculated to include all applicable sales and associated rebates, discounts and other price concessions. If we become aware that our MDRP submissions for a prior period were incorrect or have changed as a result of recalculation of the pricing data, we must resubmit the corrected data for up to three years after those data originally were due. If we fail to provide information timely or are found to have knowingly submitted false information to CMS, we may be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions, including termination from the MDRP.
 Federal law requires that a manufacturer that participates in the MDRP also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B program is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, or HRSA and requires us to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for our covered outpatient drugs when used in an outpatient setting. 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low‑income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on the AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the MDRP. In general, products subject to Medicaid price reporting and rebate liability are also subject to the 340B ceiling price requirement. We must report 340B ceiling prices to HRSA on a quarterly basis, and HRSA publishes them to 340B covered entities. HRSA has finalized regulations regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities for 340B‑eligible drugs. HRSA has also finalized an administrative dispute resolution process through which 340B covered entities may pursue claims against participating manufacturers for overcharges.
In order to be eligible to have drug products paid for with federal funds under Medicaid and Medicare Part B and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we must also participate in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, pricing program. Under the VA/FSS program, we must report the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price, or Non-FAMP, for our covered drugs to the VA and charge certain federal agencies no more than the Federal Ceiling Price, which is calculated based on Non-FAMP using a statutory formula. These four agencies are the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service). We must also pay rebates on products purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program. If a manufacturer participating in the FSS program fails to provide timely information or is found to have knowingly submitted false information, the manufacturer may be subject to civil monetary penalties.
 Individual states continue to consider and have enacted legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs and combination products. A number of states have either implemented or are considering implementation of drug price transparency legislation. Requirements under such laws include advance notice of planned price increases, reporting price increase amounts and factors considered in taking such increases, wholesale acquisition cost information disclosure to prescribers, purchasers, and state agencies, and new product notice and reporting. Such legislation could limit the price or payment for certain drugs, and a number of states are authorized to impose civil monetary penalties or pursue other enforcement mechanisms against manufacturers for the untimely, inaccurate, or incomplete reporting of drug pricing information or for otherwise failing to comply with drug price transparency requirements
 Healthcare Reform
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States, was signed into law and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement adjustments and fraud and abuse changes. Additionally, the ACA increases the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; expanded manufacturer Medicaid rebate liability to include utilization by beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; modified the AMP definition under the MDRP for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; increased the number of entities eligible for discounts under the 340B program; and included a discount on brand name drugs for Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap, or “donut hole.”
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the

constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, an executive order was issued to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law, which eliminates the statutory cap on the Medicaid drug rebate, currently set at 100% of a drug’s AMP, beginning January 1, 2024.
The cost of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States has also been the subject of considerable discussion. There have been several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated.
Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 Data Privacy and Security
 We are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, and the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing
 Human Capital
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, attracting, retaining and motivating our highly qualified management and our other employees, non-employee directors and consultants. The principal purposes of our long-term, equity-based incentive awards are to align the interests of our named executive officers and other employees, non-employee directors and consultants with the interests of our stockholders.
 As of December 31, 2022, we had four full-time employees and several consultants in the regulatory, clinical, manufacturing and finance areas. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining arrangement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
