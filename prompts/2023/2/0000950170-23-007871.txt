Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company, discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat unmet needs in immune-mediated diseases and cancer. We believe therapies that inhibit multiple drivers of disease by targeting fundamental upstream control processes within the cell have the potential for profound therapeutic benefit in a number of difficult-to-treat diseases. To that end, we are advancing two drug development programs that harness different regulators of cellular function: the first targets the immunoproteasome which is responsible for protein degradation in cells of the immune system and drives many key aspects of immune cell function, and the second targets the Sec61 translocon, which is located on the endoplasmic reticulum and represents the beginning of the protein secretion pathway. Targeting these fundamental regulators of cellular function offers an attractive approach to treating many diseases.
Our lead product candidate, zetomipzomib, is a first-in-class selective immunoproteasome inhibitor that has completed Phase 1a testing in healthy volunteers and a Phase 1b trial in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. In November 2022, we reported positive results from the completed Phase 2a portion of the MISSION trial of zetomipzomib in patients with lupus nephritis, or LN. In the first half of 2023, we will be initiating PALIZADE, a global, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating zetomipzomib in patients with LN. In addition, we are leveraging the broad therapeutic potential of zetomipzomib in other severe autoimmune diseases of high unmet medical need. PORTOLA is a placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating zetomipzomib in patients with autoimmune hepatitis, or AIH, a rare, chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the liver and causes inflammation and tissue damage. We are also continuing to explore development opportunities for zetomipzomib in patients with SLE, a chronic inflammatory disease.
Based on clinical data generated to date with zetomipzomib, we believe that zetomipzomib has the potential to address multiple chronic immune-mediated diseases. We believe that the immunoproteasome is a validated target for the treatment of a wide variety of immune-mediated diseases given its ability to regulate multiple drivers of the inflammatory disease process. Many inflammatory disorders are currently treated one cytokine or cell type at a time, but the immunoproteasome affects a broad spectrum of immune regulators. We have seen encouraging clinical activity and biomarker data in the SLE and LN patients who received zetomipzomib in the MISSION trial. The safety and tolerability profiles of zetomipzomib has been favorable and consistent with the needs for a long-term therapy. We intend to identify additional immune-mediated disease indications where a proof of principle exists to further develop zetomipzomib.
 Our oncology product candidate, KZR-261, is being studied in an open-label Phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well to explore preliminary anti-tumor activity. This study is being conducted in two parts: dose escalation in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies, and dose expansion in patients with selected tumor types. KZR-261 is the first clinical candidate from our novel research platform targeting the Sec61 translocon and the protein secretion pathway for the discovery and development of small molecule therapeutics for oncology and autoimmune indications. KZR-261 has demonstrated broad anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of both solid and hematologic malignancies by targeting multiple pathways driving tumor growth and survival.
We believe this discovery platform has the potential to yield additional small molecule product candidates with the ability to inhibit multiple pathways as a single agent, as well as compounds designed to selectively inhibit a single secreted or transmembrane protein of interest. For example, in November 2022, we presented promising preclinical data on KZR-540, an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectively blocks PD-1 expression via inhibition of the Sec61 translocon. If successfully developed and approved, small molecules generated from our protein secretion program could serve as alternatives to currently marketed biologic therapeutics to act as cytotoxic anti-cancer agents or to block the secretion of novel targets of interest in immuno-oncology or inflammation.

Zetomipzomib: Selective Immunoproteasome Inhibitor
 We believe that zetomipzomib is the only selective immunoproteasome inhibitor that is in clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. If successfully developed and approved, zetomipzomib may have the ability to become the standard of care across a range of immune-mediated diseases based on the following key attributes:
 •broad and potent immunomodulatory activity that may provide meaningful therapeutic benefit without immunosuppression across a range of treatable and currently untreatable immune-mediated diseases;
 •subcutaneous, once weekly dosing schedule which is amenable to patient self-administration with the potential of less frequent dosing for chronic use;
 •rapid drug clearance from the plasma with a half-life of less than five hours; 
 •minimal predicted risk for drug-drug interactions;
 •no teratogenicity or reproductive toxicity observed in nonclinical studies;
 •full recovery of immunoproteasome activity occurs within three to seven days following dose administration; and
 •unique chemical structure leads to highly specific inhibition of the immunoproteasome without known off-target effects.
 Clinical Development of Zetomipzomib
 We are focusing the development of zetomipzomib in chronic and severe immune-mediated diseases where limited treatment options exist. Due to its broad immunomodulatory profile, we believe that zetomipzomib has the potential to address multiple chronic-immune mediated diseases.
PALIZADE Phase 2b Trial
 PALIZADE is a Phase 2b global, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two dose-levels of zetomipzomib in patients with active LN. Target enrollment will be 279 patients, who will be randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive 30 mg of zetomipzomib, 60 mg of zetomipzomib or placebo subcutaneously once weekly for 52 weeks, in addition to standard background therapy. Background therapy can, but will not be mandated to, include standard induction therapy. Over the initial 16 weeks, there will be a mandatory corticosteroid taper to 5 mg per day or less. End-of-treatment assessments will occur at Week 53, and the end-of-study assessments will occur at Week 57.


The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients who achieve a complete renal response, or CRR, at Week 37. CRR is defined as a urine protein-to-creatine ratio, or UPCR, of 0.5 or less and stable estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, in patients who have not received rescue or prohibited medications. Key secondary endpoints include: the proportion of patients achieving partial renal response, or PRR, at Week 37; the number of CRRs at Weeks 25 and 53; and the number of PRRs at Weeks 25 and 53. PRR is defined as a fifty percent or greater reduction in UPCR from baseline, as well as an absolute reduction of UPCR at or below 1.0, if the baseline is less than 3.0, or an absolute reduction of UPCR below 3.0, if the baseline is 3.0 or greater. The primary safety endpoint is the incidence and severity of adverse events. Additional secondary and exploratory endpoints include measures of SLE disease activity including flare. We expect a primary analysis from PALIZADE to occur in mid-2026, and we expect to receive the full 52-week end-of-treatment data in second half 2026.
 LN is one of the most serious complications of SLE and is a disease comprising a spectrum of vascular, glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions that develops in approximately 50% of SLE patients within 10 years of their initial diagnosis. LN is associated with considerable morbidity, including an increased risk of end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or renal transplantation and an increased risk of death. Management of this disease typically consists of induction therapy to achieve remission and long-term maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. There are FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of LN. However, an unmet need still exists for treatments that can reduce disease activity quickly and without widespread immunosuppression.
MISSION Phase 2 Trial
 The Phase 2 portion of MISSION was an open-label trial to demonstrate the responder rate of zetomipzomib in patients with active LN. During the 24-week treatment period, patients received 60 mg of zetomipzomib subcutaneously once weekly (first dose of 30 mg) in addition to standard background therapy. Patients in the MISSION Phase 2 trial did not receive zetomipzomib as part of an “induction” therapy, which represented a significant difference in comparison to other recently published trials in LN. End of treatment assessments occurred at Week 25. The primary efficacy endpoint for the trial was the proportion of patients achieving a renal response measured by a 50% or greater reduction in UPCR at end of treatment. The secondary efficacy endpoint for the trial was the number of patients with CRR and PRR.
In November 2022, we presented complete results from the open-label Phase 2 portion of the MISSION trial evaluating zetomipzomib in patients with active LN. During the 24-week treatment period, patients received 60 mg of zetomipzomib subcutaneously once weekly (first dose of 30 mg) in addition to stable background therapy. End-of-treatment assessments occurred at Week 25, or EOT, with safety follow-up and end of study occurring at Week 37, or EOS. Patients in the MISSION Phase 2 clinical trial received zetomipzomib without induction therapy, which represents a difference from other recently published trials in LN. The primary efficacy endpoint for the trial was the proportion of patients achieving an overall renal response, or ORR, measured as a 50% or greater reduction in UPCR at EOT. A key secondary efficacy endpoint was the number of patients with a CRR, measured as an absolute reduction in proteinuria values to a UPCR of 0.5 or less, with preserved renal function measured by eGFR, and daily corticosteroid use of 10 mg or less prednisone/prednisone equivalent and no use of prohibited medication.


In the MISSION Phase 2 clinical trial, 17 of 21 enrolled patients reached end-of-treatment assessments at Week 25 and end-of-study assessments at Week 37. Zetomipzomib treatment demonstrated steady and clinically meaningful renal responses with additional ORRs and CRRs observed during the safety follow-up period:
Overall Renal Responses:
 •10 out 17 patients (58.8%) achieved an ORR as early as Week 13.
 •At EOT, 11 of 17 patients (64.7%) achieved an ORR, measured as a 50% or greater reduction in UPCR compared to baseline, the primary endpoint of the clinical trial. 
 •During the safety follow-up period, clinical responses improved, and ORRs increased to 16 of 17 patients (94.1%) at Week 29 and 15 of 17 patients (88.2%) at EOS. In addition, UPCR was reduced to clinically meaningful levels:
 o11 of 17 patients (64.7%) achieved a UPCR of 0.5 or less at EOS.
 o15 of 17 patients (88.2%) achieved a UPCR of 0.7 or less at EOS.
 oMedian UPCR was 0.32 at EOS.
 
Complete Renal Responses:
 •5 out 17 patients (29.4%) achieved a CRR as early as Week 13.
 •At EOT, 6 of 17 patients (35.3%) achieved a CRR, a key secondary efficacy endpoint, measured as a UPCR of 0.5 or less, stable eGFR, daily prednisone/prednisone equivalent dose of 10 mg or less, and no use of prohibited medication. 
 •During the safety follow-up period, an additional patient achieved a CRR, with the total CRRs increasing to 7 of 17 patients (41.2%) at Week 29 and EOS, demonstrating a deepening renal response throughout the 37-week trial.
Additional Results:
•Urinary CD163, a biomarker that is associated with active inflammation in the kidney, decreased and showed a strong correlation to UPCR across all timepoints in the study. These data suggest that patients had active inflammation at baseline despite standard-of-care therapy and that the addition of zetomipzomib reduced inflammation.
 •By Week 13, 14 of 17 patients (82.4%) achieved a daily corticosteroid dose of 10 mg or less, including a 58% reduction in mean values of corticosteroid dose, despite no protocol-mandated steroid taper. Doses of background immunosuppressive agents remained stable throughout the study, including during the 12-week safety follow-up.
 •Mean eGFR remained stable from baseline to EOS.
 
SLE Disease Activity:
 •Key measurements of SLE disease activity were reduced and key biomarkers of SLE improved in patients completing the trial. There was no evidence of early rebound of inflammation following discontinuation of zetomipzomib.
 oSLEDAI-2K (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000, a global SLE disease scoring system) scores reduced from a mean of 11.3 at baseline to 6.5 at EOT and 5.8 at EOS.
 oCLASI-A (Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Severity Index-Activity, a measure of active SLE skin disease) scores reduced from a mean of 5.7 at baseline to 2.6 at EOT and 3.0 at EOS.
 oPhysician Global Assessment scores reduced from a mean of 57.2 at baseline to 23.9 at EOT and 16.2 at EOS.
 oPatient Global Assessment scores reduced from a mean of 23.6 at baseline to 10.7 at EOT and 6.6 at EOS.
 •Biomarkers of SLE activity improved or normalized in patients with abnormal baseline levels.
 oOf the 12 patients with abnormal levels of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, or anti-dsDNA, at baseline, 10 patients showed improved or normalized levels of anti-dsDNA at EOT, and the improvement was maintained in 9 patients at EOS. 
 o4 of 5 patients with abnormally low C3 complement levels at baseline demonstrated improvement at EOT. 
 o3 of 4 patients with abnormally low C4 complement levels at baseline demonstrated improvement at EOT.
 
Zetomipzomib was well tolerated over the course of the 37-week trial. Adverse events were generally mild-to-moderate, rated as Grade 1 or 2. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were injection site reaction, pyrexia, headache, or nausea with or without vomiting. Two patients experienced serious adverse events on the study. One patient had an acute protracted migraine related to zetomipzomib, but completed treatment. The other patient discontinued following worsening pulmonary arterial hypertension, a urinary tract infection and an acute kidney injury, which were all deemed unrelated to zetomipzomib. Early terminations occurred in 4 out of 21 patients. No opportunistic or Grade 3 infections were reported in the trial. No accumulation occurred with repeat dosing, and no serum monitoring was required in this trial.


MISSION Phase 1b Trial
 In June 2021, we presented results from the completed MISSION Phase 1b clinical trial of zetomipzomib. The Phase 1b dose escalation study evaluated doses of 45 mg to 75 mg of zetomipzomib administered subcutaneously once weekly in a total of 47 patients with SLE, including 2 patients with active proliferative LN. 35 of 47 patients completed the study across six cohorts in which patients received 13 weekly doses of zetomipzomib and were followed for an additional 12 weeks.
Encouraging trends in exploratory efficacy were confirmed across cohorts, including the improvement of seven SLE-specific disease activity scores. Mean disease activity scores improved in patients who completed the 13-week treatment period (n=35), and improvement in disease activity persisted following the end-of-treatment. Improvement in key biomarkers indicating a reduction in disease activity were also observed. Reduced levels of anti-dsDNA were seen in 8 of 8 patients with elevated levels at baseline. Improvement in disease activity persisted following the end-of-treatment. The safety and tolerability of zetomipzomib was favorable and consistent with needs for a long-term therapy. Most treatment emergent adverse events occurred early and diminished with later doses with the most common being injection site reactions.
Two of two patients in this trial with active proliferative LN had a greater than 50% reduction in UPCR and experienced reductions in anti-dsDNA levels and SLEDAI-2K scores (SLE Disease Activity Index 2000). Biomarker data on these two patients with LN show baseline elevation of urinary CD163, or uCD163, a marker of inflammatory activity in the kidney in patients with LN. Both patients also had a reduction in uCD163 levels, suggesting an important anti-inflammatory effect not achieved with the background therapies.
 Investigator-Initiated Single-Patient Study
In November 2021, Samir Parikh, M.D., an Associate Professor, Division of Nephrology at The Ohio State University, presented a case report on an investigator-initiated clinical study of zetomipzomib where Dr. Parikh treated a single patient with LN who previously received zetomipzomib under the Phase 1b portion of MISSION. Following completion of the MISSION Phase 1b study, the patient experienced worsening course of disease and return to nephrotic range proteinuria. Specifically, the patient’s UPCR went from 0.56 at three months following study completion to 5.5 at nine months following study completion. Dr. Parikh then started the patient on high dose prednisone of 40 mg/day for 30 days which was tapered to 15 mg/day until beginning the investigator-initiated clinical study. With prednisone therapy, proteinuria improved from 5.5 to 2.4 and remained there until resuming treatment with zetomipzomib. Within 12 weeks of re-treatment with zetomipzomib, the patient’s UPCR reduced to below 0.5 with complete cessation of corticosteroids. Kezar was not the sponsor of this study and has not independently verified or audited these data.
PORTOLA Trial
 We have initiated PORTOLA, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of zetomipzomib in patients with AIH who are insufficiently responding to standard of care or have relapsed. Target enrollment will be 24 patients, who will be randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either zetomipzomib or placebo in addition to background corticosteroid therapy for 24 weeks and includes a protocol-mandated steroid taper by Week 14. The primary efficacy endpoint measures the proportion of patients who achieve a complete response, measured as normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels with a successful corticosteroid taper by Week 24. We expect to receive topline data from the PORTOLA trial in mid-2025.
 
AIH is a rare, chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the liver and causes inflammation and tissue damage, severely impacting patients’ physical health and quality of life. Lifelong maintenance therapy is required to avoid relapse and burdensome adverse effects. If left untreated, AIH can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Standard of care treatment for AIH is chronic, immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids that do not address the pathophysiology of AIH, can result in significant toxicity associated with long-term use and often result in inadequate response or relapse after treatment withdrawal. There is a significant need for treatment regimens that reduce or remove the high dependency on chronic immunosuppression using corticosteroids.
 PRESIDIO Trial
 In May 2022, we reported topline results from our PRESIDIO trial of zetomipzomib in patients with dermatomyositis, or DM, and polymyositis, or PM. PRESIDIO was a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of zetomipzomib in patients with active DM or PM. During the 32-week treatment period, patients received either 45 mg of zetomipzomib or placebo subcutaneously once weekly for 16 weeks followed by a crossover to the other treatment arm for an additional 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of PRESIDIO was the mean change in the Total Improvement Score, or TIS, from beginning to end of treatment with zetomipzomib. Topline results from PRESIDIO showed that most DM and PM patients saw clinically meaningful improvements in TIS, but zetomipzomib did not


demonstrate significant differentiation from placebo. The overall safety and tolerability of zetomipzomib was favorable and consistent with previous results.

Patients completing the PRESIDIO Phase 2 clinical trial had the opportunity to enroll into an open-label extension, or OLE, study to continue receiving zetomipzomib treatment for up to a total of 96 weeks. The open-label extension portion of our PRESIDIO Phase 2 clinical trial remains ongoing and a majority of eligible patients either completed the OLE or remain enrolled, including one patient who has received 96 weeks of zetomipzomib administration, the end of treatment under the extension study. We continue to collect safety data from the open-label extension, which we expect to be completed in the first half of 2023.
 Safety Profile
 Safety and tolerability are monitored across clinical trials of zetomipzomib by study-specific data monitoring committees. To date, injection site reactions, or ISRs, are the most common treatment emergent adverse event. The ISRs occur at the time and site of injection, are described as redness, pain, itchiness or induration. The ISRs are not vasculitic or immunogenic. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities have been noted; and specifically, we have not observed cytopenias, transaminase abnormalities or renal dysfunction. In addition, no opportunistic infections or serious infections have been observed to date. It was observed that upon initiation of zetomipzomib therapy, some patients experienced a constellation of symptoms that included low grade fever, headache, myalgias, nausea, and/or vomiting. Based on these observations, we introduced a dosing regimen where patients receive an initial dose of 30 mg of zetomipzomib followed by administration of the target dose of 45 mg, 60 mg or 75 mg of zetomipzomib. The introduction of an initial “step up” dose, together with prophylactic and supportive measures such as oral hydration with electrolyte-rich drinks, has substantially mitigated this early concern. Some patients have reported nausea and occasional vomiting on the day of dosing, which has also been mitigated with the use of optional oral hydration and/or oral or sublingual antiemetics. In longer term exposure to zetomipzomib during the PRESIDIO open-label extension trial, seven patients have received zetomipzomib 45mg weekly for more than 12 months, and one patient received zetomipzomib weekly for up to two years. With chronic exposure, no new safety or tolerability events were observed and there remained no signs or symptoms of immunosuppression.
 Immune-Mediated Diseases and Selective Inhibition of the Immunoproteasome
 We are focusing our development efforts on immune-mediated diseases of high unmet need and intend to identify additional indications to develop zetomipzomib. Immune-mediated diseases are conditions which result from abnormal activity of the body’s immune system. They are characterized by immune dysregulation, and the inappropriate activation of inflammatory cytokines is an underlying manifestation. These abnormal immune responses can lead to activation of inflammatory and cytotoxic T cells, which can cause further inflammation, activation of other inflammatory cells such as macrophages and results in tissue and organ damage.
 Autoimmune disease is a subset of immune-mediated diseases whereby an immune response is directed against the body’s own healthy cells and tissues. Approximately 50 million people in the United States suffer from more than 100 diagnosed autoimmune diseases according to the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, Inc.
 These inflammatory disorders are currently treated one cytokine or cell type at a time or with powerful immunosuppressive agents. Across all immune-mediated diseases, both large and small, there remain significant unmet medical needs and indications with no approved drugs beyond broadly prescribed corticosteroids and similar immunosuppressive agents. These therapies result in increased risks of infection and malignancy and a wide variety of side effects. In many autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive regimens do not always induce high rates of clinically meaningful responses. Even if these agents are initially effective, over time patients often experience loss of response.
Proteasomes are found in all cells of the body and regulate intracellular protein degradation and are essential for many cellular processes such as cell division, cell differentiation and cytokine production. There are two main forms of the proteasome: the constitutive proteasome and the immunoproteasome. In most tissues of the body, the constitutive proteasome is the predominant form. In cells of the immune system, the immunoproteasome is the predominant form. While both forms of the proteasome mediate protein degradation, the two forms of the proteasome accomplish this utilizing different active sites. These active sites are responsible for cleaving and degrading proteins. zetomipzomib is derived from medicinal chemistry efforts focused on potent and selective inhibition of the immunoproteasome-specific subunits LMP7 and LMP2.
In preclinical models of inflammation, selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome were shown to block cytokine production and result in profound immunomodulatory therapeutic activity equivalent to or better than approved dual proteasome inhibitors without causing cytotoxicity. In over 15 peer-reviewed publications, our selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome and related compounds have demonstrated strong therapeutic potential by blocking disease progressions in animal models multiple immune-mediated diseases. Additionally, this immunomodulatory response was broadly seen across many cell types of the immune system, including both T-cells and B-cells, and was demonstrated in a non-immunosuppressive manner. This is distinct from other agents currently used to treat autoimmunity, which typically target a single cytokine or immune cell type or are broadly immunosuppressive.
 

KZR-261: A First-In-Class Protein Secretion Inhibitor
 KZR-261 is a novel, first-in-class protein secretion inhibitor and the first clinical candidate nominated from our protein secretion platform. KZR-261 acts through direct interaction and inhibition of Sec61translocon activity. The net effect is a single agent that works broadly to reduce oncogenic factors important to proliferation, metastasis and immune evasion in preclinical cancer models. We have presented encouraging preclinical data with KZR-261 that highlight its potential as a new anti-cancer agent for the treatment of both solid and hematologic malignancies. In multiple in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, KZR-261 has shown broad tumor growth inhibition including tumors resistant to traditional chemotherapeutics. The direct anti-tumor effect of KZR-261 is driven by induction of cell death through proteotoxic stress and other factors, as well as the reduced expression of key growth factors and receptors driving tumor survival and proliferation. In addition, KZR-261 modulates the tumor microenvironment by reducing angiogenic factor expression (e.g., VEGF) and reducing immune checkpoint expression. The preclinical data generated with KZR-261 increases our belief that inhibiting the Sec61 translocon could be effective against a variety of solid and hematologic tumor types.
Clinical Development of KZR-261
 
In October 2021, we initiated an open-label Phase 1 clinical trial of KZR-261 in patients with solid tumor malignancies. The study is being conducted in two parts: dose escalation in any solid tumor, and dose expansion in four tumor-specific solid tumors (colorectal, melanoma, mesothelioma and prostate) and one all-tumor cohort. The study is designed to evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, identify a recommended Phase 2 dose and explore the preliminary anti-tumor activity of KZR-261 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. We expect the dose expansion study to start in the second half of 2023 and results from individual tumor cohorts beginning mid-2024 through the second half of 2025.
 As of March 2023, the dose escalation study is enrolling Cohort 6 (27 mg/m2). Previously, Cohort 1 (1.8 mg/m2) through Cohort 4 (12 mg/m2) enrolled 12 patients and completed rapid dose escalation without significant safety concerns. Cohort 5 (18 mg/m2) enrolled six patients, and two patients are in their fifth cycle (with each cycle including 3 doses over 4 weeks). The Cohort 5 dose-level is approximately equivalent to the minimally effective dose as determined in preclinical anti-tumor studies. To date, KZR-261 has shown dose-proportional exposure, no signs of accumulation or altered pharmacokinetics with repeated dosing, and a half-life of greater than 25 hours with measurable levels at day 8, indicating continuous exposure with weekly dosing. To date, there have been no consistent patterns of safety signals. We observed a single dose-limiting toxicity of asymptomatic lipase elevation in Cohort 4, and there has been one SUSAR (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction), an infusion-related reaction, which abated with the use of prophylaxis at subsequent administrations. We plan to report topline safety and dose escalation data from this trial in the second half of 2023.
 Discovery Platform: Inhibition of the Protein Secretion Pathway via the Sec61 Translocon
 Our novel platform for drug discovery targets the Sec61 translocon and the protein secretion pathway to develop potential therapies for oncology, immune-oncology and autoimmune indications. Our research has shown that multiple chemical series can be tuned to selectively target the interaction between unique protein signal sequences and Sec61. We have generated chemical series that can inhibit expression of multiple secreted and transmembrane proteins, as well as compounds designed to selectively inhibit a single secreted or transmembrane protein of interest. We believe that protein secretion inhibitors have the potential to replicate the activity of biologic therapies and can be designed for oral bioavailability. For example, in November 2022, we presented promising preclinical data on KZR-540, an orally bioavailable small molecule that selectively blocks PD-1 expression via inhibition of the Sec61 translocon. We expect to nominate a clinical candidate for an oral anti-PD-1 compound in the second half of 2023.
 The activity of the Sec61 translocon is a highly conserved process, as virtually all secreted and transmembrane proteins (approximately 6,000 proteins) utilize Sec61 to enter the endoplasmic reticulum and begin the process of transit to the cell surface. Each protein expresses a unique signal sequence or transmembrane domain. By blocking the functional interaction of signal sequences and Sec61, our tool compounds can inhibit the expression of multiple proteins simultaneously or induce selective inhibition of a small number of proteins. Many validated targets utilize the Sec61 translocon, including targets currently served only by biologic therapies, and our program holds the potential for best-in-class small molecule therapeutics against these targets.
We have highlighted our work from the protein secretion platform during several scientific and medical conferences, including the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), American Society of Hematology (ASH), the International Cytokine and Interferon Society (ICIS) and the Society of Immunotherapy in Cancer (SITC). Our preclinical research on the Sec61 translocon demonstrated high degrees of potency against a large number of therapeutically relevant oncology, immuno-oncology, and inflammatory targets that are Sec61 client proteins, translating into broad anti-tumor or anti-inflammatory activity. Our discovery-stage Sec61 inhibitors have shown to induce anti-tumor activity against multiple hematologic tumor types without inducing cell death in normal cells or significant toxicity in animals. Our tool compounds also block inflammation in animal models of autoimmunity at doses of less than 1/8th the maximum tolerated dose.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to focus on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy are to:
•Develop zetomipzomib in multiple autoimmune indications. We believe that zetomipzomib has the potential to treat a wide range of immune-mediated diseases. We are conducting clinical trials in indications of high unmet need. Assuming positive results from these trials, we intend to explore registration-enabling trials in each indication. 
 •Develop KZR-261 in oncology. We believe KZR-261 has the potential to be a first-in-class therapeutic modulating the protein secretion pathway and the Sec61 translocon. KZR-261 has demonstrated broad anti-tumor activity in preclinical models of both solid and hematologic malignancies by inhibiting multiple pathways for tumor growth and survival.
 •Expand our pipeline of small molecule disruptors of the protein secretion pathway. We intend to continue leveraging our protein secretion platform to identify additional product candidates for the treatment of diseases with significant clinical need in oncology, immuno-oncology and inflammation. This discovery platform has the potential to yield small molecule product candidates that can selectively inhibit single proteins of interest.
 •Maximize the value of our programs by maintaining flexibility to commercialize our product candidates independently or through collaborative partnerships. We currently have exclusive global development and commercialization rights for our product candidates for all indications that we may pursue. While we may develop these products independently, we may also enter into strategic relationships with biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies to advance our product candidates. 
 License Agreement with Onyx
In June 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Onyx Therapeutics, Inc., or Onyx, a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen, or the Onyx License Agreement, pursuant to which Onyx granted us an exclusive license under certain patent rights, and a non-exclusive license to certain know-how, in each case controlled by Onyx, to develop, manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing certain types of compounds, including zetomipzomib, that are selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome for any and all uses other than those related to the diagnosis and/or treatment in humans of cancerous or pre-cancerous diseases and/or conditions, including those related to hematological diseases and/or conditions that are not inflammatory diseases or disorders. Patent coverage for zetomipzomib extends to at least 2034.
As partial consideration for the intellectual property rights licensed to us, we issued Onyx shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which converted into 1,121,384 shares of our common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering on June 25, 2018.
Under the Onyx License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Onyx milestone payments of up to $172.5 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Commencing upon the first commercial sale of a licensed product, we must make royalty payments to Onyx on net sales of such licensed products based on tiered annual net sales thresholds at varying royalty rates ranging in the mid to high single digits, subject to certain customary reductions. We must pay such royalties on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of the expiration of all licensed patents that claim such product in such country, the loss of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country and the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. The licensed product patent portfolio includes issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea with expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2034, absent any patent extensions available. For more information on our intellectual property, see “Business — Intellectual Property.” Upon the expiration of such royalty term in such country, our license to such product will become fully paid-up, irrevocable, and non-exclusive.
Under the Onyx License Agreement, Onyx has a right of first negotiation to obtain a license, or a similar transfer of rights, to develop and/or commercialize any licensed product.
The Onyx License Agreement will remain in effect until the expiration of last-to-expire royalty term for any licensed product in the territory. The license agreement may be terminated by us with prior notice, by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured for a certain number of days, such number depending on the type of breach, by either party for insolvency of the other party, or immediately by Onyx if we challenge any of the licensed patents.
 Sales and Marketing
Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to build a commercial infrastructure to support sales of our products in the United States. We expect to manage sales, marketing and


distribution through internal resources and third-party relationships. While we may commit significant financial and management resources to commercial activities, we will also consider collaborating with one or more pharmaceutical companies to enhance our commercial capabilities. Outside the United States, we plan to seek pharmaceutical partners for sales and marketing activities.
Manufacturing
We are continuing to establish manufacturing processes for all of the components used in our product candidates to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and we do not have plans to develop our own cGMP manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to manufacture all of our raw materials, intermediaries, active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and finished drug product for our clinical trials. We require that our CMOs produce API and finished drug product used in our clinical trials in accordance with cGMP and all other applicable laws and regulations. We also contract with additional third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of our investigational drug products. We maintain manufacturing agreements with our CMOs that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to zetomipzomib and KZR-261. We do not have long term supply agreements or arrangements for redundant supply in place; however, we believe we can identify and establish additional CMOs to manufacture our product candidates.
We may continue to rely on CMOs to develop and manufacture our products for commercial sale. Development and commercial quantities of any products we develop will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the requirements of the FDA and the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. If zetomipzomib or KZR-261 are approved by any regulatory agency, we intend to enter into agreements with one or more CMOs for their commercial production.
We are currently administering zetomipzomib as a lyophilized product candidate, meaning it is freeze-dried and must be reconstituted with water prior to delivery to a patient. In our clinical trials, zetomipzomib is reconstituted in the hospital pharmacy prior to patient administration. We first introduced at-home self-administration of zetomipzomib for patients in the PRESIDIO OLE study. We intend that if approved and commercialized, zetomipzomib will be self-administered by patients using the sterile vial-adaptor device.
Competition
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety, tolerability, dosing convenience, price, coverage and reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries.
 Our current and potential future competitors may also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for the disorders we are targeting by a competitor could render our current or future product candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses.
We are aware of two companies engaged in drug discovery and development of selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome. Principia Biopharma, a Sanofi company, is engaged in preclinical research focused on the discovery of orally bioavailable and selective inhibitors of the immunoproteasome. In addition, IpiNovyx Bio, founded in 2021, is engaged in preclinical research focused on small molecule immunoproteasome therapies for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
 Currently, SLE is treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine. Current guidance for the treatment of proliferative LN involves induction therapy with either CellCept or Cytoxan® (cyclophosphamide) and corticosteroids. Additionally, there are two drugs recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of LN: Benlysta® (belimumab), an anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody from GlaxoSmithKline is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe SLE and LN; and Lupkynis (voclosporin), a calcineurin inhibitor from Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, is approved for the treatment of active LN, in each case in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen.
Other companies are developing agents to treat both SLE and LN. These agents include antibodies against the interferon alpha receptor, such as Saphnelo® (anifrolumab) from AstraZeneca, against IL-17, such as Cosentyx® (secukinumab), under evaluation by


Novartis, the B-cell depleting agent Gazyva® (obinutuzimab) from Roche, and small molecule agents targeting TYK2, such as Sotyktu from Bristol Meyers Squibb.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, including by obtaining and maintaining patent protection in the United States and internationally for our technology platform, product candidates, novel biological discoveries, new therapeutic approaches and potential indications, and other inventions that are important to our business. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. We require our employees, consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements prohibiting the disclosure of confidential information and requiring disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
 For our product candidates, generally we initially pursue patent protection covering compositions of matter and methods of use. Throughout the development of our product candidates, we seek to identify additional means of obtaining patent protection that would potentially enhance commercial success, including through additional methods of use, process of making, formulations, and salt and polymorph related claims.
In total, our patent portfolio, including patents licensed from Onyx, comprises more than 10 different patent families, filed in various jurisdictions worldwide, including families directed to composition of matter for selective immunoproteasome inhibitors and protein secretion inhibitors. Our patent portfolio includes issued patents in, among other jurisdictions, the United States, Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea with expiration dates ranging from 2027 to 2037.

 KP-01-003—Composition of matter patent directed to a protein secretion modulator chemical scaffold developed jointly by Kezar in collaboration with the Taunton Lab at UCSF. There is an issued patent in the United States. The 20-year term of this family is March 2039, absent any patent term extensions available.
 KP-01-004—Composition of matter patent application directed to a protein secretion modulator chemical scaffold developed by Kezar. There are no issued patents yet, but the 20-year term of this family is expected to be February 2040, absent any patent term extensions available.
 KP-01-007—Composition of matter patent application directed to a protein secretion modulator chemical scaffold developed by Kezar. There are no issued patents yet, but the 20-year term of this family is expected to be August 2041, absent any patent term extensions available.
 We continue to file applications for new composition of matter for other protein secretion modulators and new methods of treatment, in view of results from ongoing drug discovery and development efforts.
 Patent Term and Term Extensions
Individual patents have terms for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the restoration period cannot extend the patent term beyond 14 years from FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. All taxes or annuities for a patent, as required by the USPTO and various foreign jurisdictions, must be timely paid in order for the patent to remain in force during this period of time.
The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product by product basis, from country to country, and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Our patents and patent applications are subject to procedural or legal challenges by others. We may be unable to obtain, maintain and protect the intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business, and we may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, which could materially harm our business. For more information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Trademarks and Know-How
In connection with the ongoing development and advancement of our products and services in the United States and various international jurisdictions, we seek to create protection for our marks and enhance their value by pursuing trademarks and service marks where available and when appropriate. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we rely upon know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 

Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data; 
 •payment of user fees; and 
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA. 
 Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND application. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. An IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND application may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition,


an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.


The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and takes several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant ODD to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000, there is no reasonable expectation that sales of the drug in the United States will be sufficient to offset the costs of developing and making the drug available in the United States. ODD must be requested before submitting an NDA. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If the FDA approves a sponsor’s marketing application for a designated orphan drug for use in the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the sponsor is eligible for a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, during which the FDA may not approve another sponsor’s marketing application for a drug with the same active moiety and intended for the same use or indication as the approved orphan drug, except in limited circumstances, such as if a subsequent sponsor demonstrates its product is clinically superior. During a sponsor’s orphan drug exclusivity period, competitors, however, may receive approval for drugs with different active moieties for the same indication as the approved orphan drug, or for drugs with the same active moiety as the approved orphan drug, but for different indications. Orphan drug exclusivity could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval for a drug with the same active moiety intended for the same indication before we do, unless we are able to demonstrate that grounds for withdrawal of the orphan drug exclusivity exist, or that our product is clinically superior. Further, if a designated orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the rare disease or condition for which it received ODD, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted. If the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that are designed to treat serious conditions, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines.


Under the current PDUFA agreement, these six- and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.
Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 
 

•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act to ensure accountability in distribution.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and others, on the other hand. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated.
A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and the civil monetary penalties prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.


In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities, including covered entities, business associates and their covered subcontractors, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates, covered subcontractors and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which are not pre-empted by HIPAA, differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, as well as state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing. Additional state and local laws also require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, criminal and civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, data privacy and security laws, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Privacy and Data Security
 In the ordinary course of our business, we may process personal or sensitive data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, and other obligations related to data privacy, security, and protection. Such obligations may include, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or EU GDPR, the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (“UK”) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, or UK GDPR, and the ePrivacy Directive. In addition, several states within the United States have enacted or proposed data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act.
 Foreign data privacy and security laws (including but not limited to the EU GDPR and UK GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area, or EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; complying with specific requirements to process health-rated data; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant


supervisory authorities and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
 See the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
The future commercial success of our product candidates or any of our collaborators’ ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government, through the Medicare or Medicaid programs, provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union, or EU, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one third-party payor’s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our products and product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that third-party payors and healthcare providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party payor coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part.
Impact of Healthcare Reform on our Business
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts, which include major legislative initiatives to reduce the cost of care through changes in the healthcare system, including limits on the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded healthcare programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
There have been several U.S. government initiatives over the past few years to fund and incentivize certain comparative effectiveness research, including creation of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they


may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product on a profitable basis.
The PPACA became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other measures that may have an impact on our business, the PPACA established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Additionally, the PPACA extends manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, and expands entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program. There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, on June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the PPACA. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in PPACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible the PPACA will be subject to judicial or congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which began in 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, including the BBA, will continue until 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of the sequester. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted and, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.
In addition, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare, and subject drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” for such drugs and biologics under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates with respect to certain drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B or Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
As a result of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which introduced a merit based incentive bonus program for Medicare physicians, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program, Medicare payments are increasingly tied to quality of care


and value measures, and reporting of related data by providers such as physicians and hospitals. So called “value-based reimbursement” measures may present challenges as well as potential opportunities for biopharmaceutical manufacturers. Medicare incentives for providers meeting certain quality measures may ultimately prove beneficial for manufacturers that are able to establish that their products may help providers to meet such measures. However, manufacturers’ ability to market their drug products based on quality or value is highly regulated and not always permissible. In addition, potentially decreased Medicare reimbursement to those providers that fail to adequately comply with quality reporting requirements could translate to decreased resources available to purchase products and may negatively impact marketing or utilization of our product candidates if they are approved for marketing. We cannot predict the full impact the longer-term shift towards value-based reimbursement will have on any of our product candidates in either the Medicare program, or in any other third-party payor programs that may similarly tie payment to provider quality.
 We expect additional healthcare reform initiatives to be adopted in the future. We also expect these initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing.
 Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. For example, in the EU, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Environmental, Social and Governance
We are highly committed to policies and practices focused on environmental, social and corporate governance, or ESG, positively impacting our social community and maintaining and cultivating good corporate governance. By focusing on such ESG policies and practices, we believe we can affect a meaningful and positive change in our community and maintain an open, collaborative and positive corporate culture. We are developing zetomipzomib as a potential therapeutic for autoimmune disorders that disproportionately impact underserved communities and in orphan indications where there is a high unmet medical need.
 To ensure our ongoing success, we are committed to promoting and maintaining an inclusive, high-performing culture where all team members embrace and leverage each other's talents and backgrounds. Our commitment to diversity is articulated in our values and reflected in every part of the organization, including an employee led Diversity, Equity & Inclusion council. We are proud to actively support mentoring programs and internships for students in underserved communities as well as those interested in pursuing degrees in science and technology.
 Kezar is committed to environmentally responsible operations, which includes using natural resources wisely and considering our overall impact on the environment. We conduct our operations in a single office and laboratory space to minimize waste and use of energy and water. We take steps to reduce waste streams and ensure proper treatment of both hazardous and non-hazardous materials.
We are committed to conducting our business ethically and helping ensure that we comply with the laws and regulations that govern our business and industry in all markets in which we operate. Our employees receive training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other compliance measures. Additional corporate governance measures are discussed in our proxy statement.
 Employees and Human Capital Resources
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 84 full-time employees, 66 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and 24 of whom had an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of equity-based compensation awards and cash-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
