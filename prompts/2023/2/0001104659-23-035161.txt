Overview
GBT operates American Express Global Business Travel, the world’s leading B2B travel platform, measured by 2021 TTV, according to Travel Weekly (“2022 Power List,” June 2022, Travel Weekly). We provide a full suite of differentiated, technology-enabled solutions to business travelers and business clients, suppliers of travel content (such as airlines, hotels, ground transportation and aggregators) and third-party travel agencies. We differentiate our value proposition through our commitment to deliver to our customers unrivaled choice, value and experience, with the powerful backing of American Express GBT.
We are at the center of the global B2B travel ecosystem, managing the end-to-end logistics of business travel and providing an important link between businesses, their employees, travel suppliers and other industry participants. We service our clients in the following ways:

● | Our portfolio of travel management solutions, built around and targeting the needs of key client segments we serve, provide extensive access to flights, hotel rooms, car rentals and other travel services as well as meeting and events solutions, including exclusive negotiated content, supported by a full suite of services that allows our clients to design and operate an efficient travel program and solve complex travel requirements across all stages of the business process from planning, booking, on trip, and post trip activities.

● | Our award-winning client facing proprietary platforms are built to deliver business value through optimized user experiences across the act of business travel. These platforms, accessible over Web and Mobile interfaces and powered by our data management infrastructure and built by one of the world’s largest product engineering teams dedicated to driving technical innovation across the business travel industry. These client facing platforms are known to the market as:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Egencia primarily focuses on digital-first clients (more than 90% of transactions were served through digital channels in 2022) who value a simple, easy to use and standardized end-to-end solution.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The GBT platform is a modular solution primarily focused on flexibility of service offerings; seamlessly integrating a wide range of third-party and proprietary software and services in to one complete travel solution designed and built around the needs of each customer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | GBT Partner Solutions extends our platform to our Network Partners, TMCs and independent advisors, by offering them access to our differentiated content and technology. Through GBT Partner Solutions, we aggregate business travel demand serviced by our Network Partners at low incremental cost, which we believe enhances the economics of our platform, generates increased return on investment and expands our geographic and segment footprint.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | GBT Supply MarketPlace provides travel suppliers with efficient access to business travel clients serviced by our diverse portfolio of leading travel management solutions and Network Partners. We believe this access allows travel suppliers to benefit from premium demand (which we generally view as demand that is differentially valuable and profitable to suppliers) without incurring the costs associated with directly marketing to, and servicing the complex needs of, our business clients. Our travel supplier relationships generate efficiencies and cost savings that can be passed on to our business clients.

In June 2014, American Express established the joint venture (“JV”) comprising the GBT JerseyCo operations with a predecessor of Juweel held by a group of institutional investors led by an affiliate of Certares. Since the formation of the JV in 2014,

we have evolved from a leading TMC into a complete B2B travel platform, becoming one of the leading marketplaces in travel for business clients and travel suppliers according to Travel Weekly (“2022 Power List,” June 2022, Travel Weekly). Before June 2014, our operations were owned by American Express and primarily consisted of providing business travel solutions for business clients.
In May 2022, we executed long-term commercial agreements with American Express, including an amended and restated trademark license agreement (the “A&R Trademark License Agreement”), pursuant to which we continue to license the American Express trademarks used in the American Express Global Business Travel brand, and we license the American Express trademarks used in the American Express GBT Meetings & Events brand for business travel, meetings and events, business consulting and other services related to business travel, in each case on an exclusive and worldwide basis. The term of the A&R Trademark License Agreement is for 11 years from the Closing Date, unless earlier terminated or extended. The American Express brand, consistently ranked as one of the most valuable brands in the world, brings with it a reputation for service excellence. We believe our partnership with American Express has been an important component of our value proposition. Under our commercial agreements with American Express, we exclusively provide business travel and meetings and events services to American Express personnel, subject to limited exceptions, engage in mutual global lead generation activities with American Express for our respective services and continue to exclusively promote American Express payment products to our clients and to make those products available for use by our own personnel in connection with our business.
American Express is a bank holding company under the BHC Act, and is therefore subject to supervision, regulation and examination by U.S. bank regulatory authorities. Because and for so long as American Express “controls” GBT for the purposes of the BHC Act, GBT is subject to certain bank regulatory requirements and restrictions. For additional information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Regulatory, Tax and Litigation Matters,” “Business — Government Regulation — Banking Regulation,” “Business — Government Regulation — Activities” and “Business — Government Regulation — Acquisitions and Investments.”
Since the formation of the JV, we have expanded our capabilities, integrated new brands through acquisitions, and invested approximately $1.4 billion in product and platform (inclusive of Egencia and Ovation). The graphic below reflects such acquisitions:


● | KDS (now NEO), which we acquired in October 2016, strengthened our platform and digital capabilities in two key areas: (i) KDS’ flagship Neo Online Booking Tool and Expense platform (“Neo”) provides us with our own leading edge platform to engage with and delight travelers through digital channels; and (ii) KDS’ development group, relaunched as our Neo Technology Group (“NTG”), is part of our dedicated center of excellence for digital and ecommerce innovation supporting all our group offerings.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SMT was our long-time service delivery partner (TPN) in Finland and became our proprietary operation in October 2016.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Banks Sadler is a UK-based specialist in creative solutions for meetings and events. We acquired Banks Sadler in August 2017, and it continues to operate as a specialist brand within our meetings and events business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In December 2017, we acquired the remaining 35% equity stake in our business in Spain that was previously held by our then joint-venture partner, an affiliate of Barcelo Hotel Group. After the consummation of this acquisition, GBT Spain became our wholly-owned business.

● | In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of Hogg Robinson Group Limited (“HRG”), a global B2B services company specializing in travel management. The acquisition of HRG has enhanced our global scale, complemented our geographical footprint to offer enhanced service to our clients in key regions, and broadened our product and technology capabilities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In September 2019, we completed the acquisition of DER Business Travel (“DER”). The DER acquisition expanded our footprint into the SME segment in Germany, the largest country by travel spend in Europe according to Global Business Travel Association (“GBTA”) with a significant SME client base.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our acquisition of 30 Seconds to Fly (“30STF”) in October 2020 was an important investment in artificial intelligence (“AI”)and machine learning enabled traveler service. 30STF’s innovative CLAIRE AI can fully or partially automate travelers’ chat interactions with travel counselors, driving traveler satisfaction as well as operational efficiency.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, we completed two acquisitions in 2021:

● | In January 2021, we completed the acquisition of Ovation. Ovation is a leading specialist in providing high-touch service. The Ovation acquisition was an important step in expanding our high value capabilities and building our leadership in the large and attractive SME segment and the professional services industry. Our historical results included in this Annual Report reflect the results of Ovation from the date of its acquisition in January 2021.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Egencia Acquisition, which was completed on November 1, 2021, (i) substantially enhances our capabilities in the SME segment to significantly broaden our addressable client base; (ii) complements our SME value proposition with Egencia’s software solution specifically built for “digital-first” SME clients who want a seamless program that delivers full traveler tools and control at a lower cost; and (iii) provides leading edge traveler and client experience, as well as innovation capability powered by an experienced, proven travel technology talent base. For additional information, see “Business — Egencia Acquisition.” Our historical results included in this Annual Report reflect the results of the Egencia Acquisition from the date of its acquisition in November 2021.

GBT’s operations are headquartered in London, United Kingdom, and as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 19,000 employees worldwide with a proprietary presence or operations in 31 countries. We service clients in the rest of the world through our TPN. According to GBTA, the 31 countries in which we have a proprietary presence represent approximately 85% of business travel spend worldwide, including Egencia.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we generated TTV in excess of $22.9 billion, resulting in revenues of $1.85 billion, net loss of $229 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $103 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Key Operating and Financial Metrics — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information about our non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A discussion of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our 2020, 2021 and 2022 performance, mitigating actions taken by us and potential implications for our future performance is discussed in more detail below under “Business — Recent Performance and COVID-19 Update.”
Our business is susceptible to substantial disruptions, as described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report. In particular, for information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business travel and the Company, see “Business — Recent Performance and COVID-19 Update” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations — Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.”

Although the COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted our operations in 2020, 2021 and 2022, during our years of normalized operations, we have delivered strong revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth:

Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
Industry Overview and Competitive Landscape
Over the past 60 years, travel and tourism has been one of the largest and fastest-growing economic sectors, representing $9.2 trillion in spend, or 10.4% of global GDP in 2019, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council (“Travel & Tourism: Economic Impact 2021,” April 2021). The travel industry can generally be divided into two sectors: (i) the leisure travel sector, which serves individuals who make reservations for vacation and personal travel, and (ii) the business travel sector, which serves business clients that require travel by employees and other travelers for business needs and meetings. We focus primarily on the business travel sector.
According to GBTA, global business travel was an estimated $1.4 trillion industry in 2019 with decades of historical secular growth through economic cycles. Through the last two economic cycles (2000-2019), global business travel spend grew by an estimated CAGR of 4.4% compared to 3.7% real global GDP growth rate over the same period (“GBTA BTI Outlook Annual Global Report & Forecast: Prospects for Global Business Travel 2020-2024,” January 2021, Global Business Travel Association). We believe this growth, in excess of real GDP growth, evidences the sustained role business travel plays as a driver of business and economic growth around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and has continued to have an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry, decreasing business travel significantly below 2019 levels. Accordingly, CAGR calculations that include the year ended December 31, 2020, the year ended December 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2022 are not presented in this Annual Report because we do not believe those results are indicative of the Company’s normal operations and the travel industry more generally due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the historical track record of growth and the recovery trajectory of business travel as travel restrictions have been relaxed support the fundamental growth drivers and long-term growth potential of business travel worldwide in the future. However, the profile, extent and timing of economic and travel recovery and the pace of future growth remains inherently uncertain given the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes to business practices that may become permanent and reduce the need for business travel, and ongoing macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic. There can be no assurance that any emerging growth patterns will continue or that we will replicate our historical growth in the future. For information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on business travel, see “Business — Recent Performance and COVID-19 Update,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations — Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry.”

Business travel can be managed or unmanaged. Where business travel is unmanaged, travelers procure travel from, and are serviced by, B2C channels largely outside of business clients’ immediate oversight and control. Where business travel is managed, business clients choose a TMC through which its travelers procure travel and travel services. Through a TMC, business clients benefit from savings from demand aggregation, access to supplier content, effective fulfilment of business clients’ obligations to ensure the safety and well-being of their employees when traveling for business, and enhanced control over travel spending, among many other benefits.
We estimate that approximately 52% to 65% of business travel spend in the U.S., and approximately 40% of business travel spend in Europe, was managed in recent years. We believe that a majority of unmanaged business travel spend is driven by SMEs, which we believe provides us with a significant growth opportunity given our strong SME client base in B2B travel. Additionally, we estimate that the growth trends in our SME business, as well as the number of TMCs that currently focus on SMEs, indicate a greater demand for managed travel by SMEs.
We are the world’s leading B2B travel platform based on 2021 TTV according to Travel Weekly (“2022 Power List,” June 2022, Travel Weekly). We estimate that the top 10 TMCs in aggregate accounted for approximately $120 billion in business travel TTV in 2019, or less than 10% of total business travel spend worldwide.
Many TMCs serve a mix of business clients. However, business clients have a range of different needs and priorities, and many TMCs focus on core capabilities aligned with the needs of their target clients. We offer our customers unrivaled choice through our portfolio of leading travel management services, that target some of the most attractive segments in business travel; unrivaled value we deliver through comprehensive content and significant savings; and unrivaled traveler and customer experiences our platform offers across all our solutions and brands. We believe this differentiation is further enhanced by our brand promise — the Powerful Backing of American Express GBT:

● | Unrivaled Choice
--+-----------------


● | Global Servicing with Sophisticated Capabilities: Many clients have global operations, and this is often combined with organizational size and complexity to drive a wide range of sophisticated travel program needs. Often this includes travel management at a global and local level, a mix of insourced and outsourced processes and an ecosystem of tools and technology that varies for each client. Additionally, travel programs interface with processes and systems of other corporate functions (such as finance, HR, sustainability, risk and compliance for example). We are differentiated by our complete solution designed to solve for this complexity: we support travelers and travel managers at a local and global level, through a consistent and flexible service infrastructure and technology backbone with a comprehensive stable of traveler service and travel management solutions configured for the client. The GBT offer spans from complete outsourcing of an entire travel program for even the largest and most complex of our clients, to discreet solutions that seamlessly integrate into our clients’ travel management program and deliver on their specific needs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | SME-Focused Client and Traveler Service, Including a Diverse Portfolio of Leading Travel Management Services: SMEs typically request solutions that range from agile and turnkey to global and comprehensive. Our SME offers are tailored to SME client needs, for example, for an owner-managed SME or a SME with operations in more than one country. Our SME value proposition is differentiated by being designed to provide the flexibility to meet this range of needs of SME clients. Our specialized and diverse Ovation, Lawyers Travel, and Egencia travel management services, provide even more focused offerings to customers within the SME business where this is important and valued.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unrivaled Value
--+----------------


● | Comprehensive Content and Superior Value: While our clients have distinct service needs, the need for access to comprehensive content and best value through savings and amenities is ubiquitous across our client base. The GBT Supply MarketPlace delivers on this need with comprehensive content and superior value. The combination of solving the distinct needs of clients and travelers through tailored propositions and delivering the value of the GBT Supply MarketPlace across our entire client base underpins our differentiation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Unrivaled Experience
--+---------------------


● | Leading Human (24/7 global customer service) and Digital traveler and customer experience powered by cutting edge Proprietary Platform: Ownership of the digital experience is a critical success factor, as a simple, easy to use, intuitive traveler and client digital experience often drives the buying decision. We, through Neo and Egencia, are differentiated in this capability at global scale. Most new technology-based TMCs are focused on building this capability. We believe that our proven digital offer, further strengthened by the Egencia Acquisition, differentiates us to these clients. We believe that our ability to offer the seamless combination of digital experience with the expertise of our travel counselors and customer relationship managers is a compelling differentiator and provides us with leading value propositions for our customers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The Powerful Backing of American Express GBT
--+---------------------------------------------


● | We believe that operating to a higher standard in relation to the Environment, Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance is integral to our success with customers and suppliers and to attracting and retaining the best talent in the industry and is the cornerstone of our brand promise. We continually work and invest in our risk management framework, governance structures, practices and procedures to meet this higher standard.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that we benefit from our proven track record, reputation for service, capacity and capability to adapt to emerging needs and ability to invest in better solutions, and that these attributes will continue to support our business in the future. In particular, we believe that the following long-term structural trends have emphasized the increasingly important role of a well-managed travel program in effectively and efficiently solving critical business problems:

● | A growing emphasis on employee safety and well-being and the need for robust, high-quality, sophisticated solutions that help businesses deliver on their obligations to employees when they travel, increasing employee satisfaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business clients seeking partners with a demonstrated commitment to high-quality service and proven operational resilience despite periods of significant disruption and geopolitical uncertainty;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The rising value of technology platforms that can adapt quickly to emerging needs and support an increasingly digitally enabled workforce, supported by investments in innovation;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business clients demanding a higher standard of cybersecurity, data privacy and third-party risk management and seeking business partners committed to protecting client and traveler data while meeting the highest ethical standards;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasingly fragmented content, highlighting the attractiveness of a platform that delivers extensive access to content and simplifies the purchasing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business clients continuing to seek more control and visibility over their travel program costs, which benefits TMCs that offer a broader range of content and higher savings; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Business clients seeking partnerships with TMCs that share their ambitions for more responsible and sustainable travel with solutions and clear roadmaps that support these ambitions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that we benefit from these long-term structural trends by combining:

● | The world’s leading B2B travel platform by 2021 TTV;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | A diverse portfolio of leading travel management services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | A track record of exceptional client and traveler support;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | Comprehensive and differentiated content and experiences that drive improved savings and value; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Operations that meet high standards in cyber security, data privacy, ethics, third-party risk management and sustainability.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
During 2020, 2021 and the beginning of 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world and continued to have an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry.
Government measures implemented to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forgo time outside of their homes, continue to have an impact on business travel which remains significantly below 2019 levels.
Global travel activity has shown a recovery trend in 2022, with our transaction volumes reaching approximately 72% of 2019 transaction volumes for the three months ending December 31, 2022. Even while travel activity remained low during the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for high-quality managed travel solutions that ensure safe and effective travel has increased and continues to increase. We believe this signals a change in the long-term structural needs of business clients, which will benefit us. This is evidenced by our strong growth by newly won client expected annual value and growth in client satisfaction performance since March 2020, despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, by addressing the increasingly sophisticated needs of business clients efficiently and effectively, we believe we further enhance our value to our travel suppliers. This is evidenced by the renewal of most travel supplier contracts at equal or better terms since March 2020, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this is a testament to our deep relationships with travel suppliers and our role as an increasingly valuable long-term partner in reaching and serving premium business demand.
We believe our decisive response during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect and continue to invest in our clients and travelers further strengthened our competitive position. We:

● | Rapidly adapted to a flexible operating model that consistently delivers a high standard of service while protecting business performance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continued to invest in our platform, focusing on key areas such as digital experience and e-commerce;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further expanded our scale and capabilities through strategic acquisitions (such as Ovation and Egencia); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhanced the resilience of our revenue streams and delivered significant cost efficiencies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the resurgence of travel, indicated by recent volume trends, we believe we are positioned to capitalize on these trends and strengthen our value proposition. A more detailed overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business travel industry and our performance is set forth below under “Business — Recent Performance and COVID-19 Update” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations — Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.”
Value Proposition
We serve and create value for clients, travel suppliers and Network Partners in two ways: (i) by enabling an efficient marketplace for travel transactions through traveler service, content and distribution; and (ii) by offering a suite of products, technology and professional services that enable effective and efficient management of business travel programs.

GBT Value Proposition: Provide Solutions to Critical Problems for Customers, Travelers, and Suppliers
Clients: We serve a broad range of business clients globally across a diverse range of industries, including, among others, business and financial services, industrial, technology, healthcare, legal and other industries. During 2022, less than 40% of customer driven revenue, including supplier revenue, was generated by our top 50 clients and no single client accounted for more than 2% of such revenue.
We deliver:

● | A single source for content (including flights, hotel rooms, car rentals and other services) from our expansive network of travel suppliers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A combination of broad content choices, differentiated GBT content and amenities (the “Preferred Extras”) and client-specific sourcing programs that drive meaningful savings relative to unmanaged travel programs and other TMCs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Omnichannel (online, voice, mobile) tools to seamlessly book and plan complex itineraries, as well as full integration into Neo and other third-party expense platforms;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 24/7, high-touch, global customer service;
--+-------------------------------------------


● | A full suite of travel management tools and services, including (i) traveler care tools designed to help ensure the safety and well-being of travelers, (ii) travel spend analysis, travel policy development and governance, (iii) consulting with respect to responsible travel and environmental sustainability and (iv) offerings to partially or fully outsource clients’ travel program, including procurement, consulting and operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | End-to-end integration into client environments to facilitate compliance, human resources, finance and administrative functions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Extensive meeting and event planning capabilities, including preparing event proposals, budgeting, venue sourcing, research and coordination among other services under the American Express GBT Meetings & Events brand and the Banks Sadler brand.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16



We focus on key client segments, which are serviced through our diverse portfolio of leading travel management services, each of which we believe has a leading value proposition in its respective target segments. As of December 31, 2022, our business client base included:

● | 41 of the Business Travel News Corporate Travel 100, the top 100 corporations in the U.S. by business travel spend (“2022 Corporate Travel 100,” September 2022, Business Travel News);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Seven of the 10 largest U.S. Banks (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, largest holding companies by total assets as of 30 September 2022); five of the top 10 largest Pharmaceutical Companies by revenue (Pharmaceutical Executive, Volume 42, Issue 6, June 2022);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Six of the top 10 “best companies to work for” (“Fortune 500” and “100 Best Companies to Work For,” 2022, FORTUNE); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Many of the most valuable corporations in Europe, including 29 of the FTSE 100, 10 of the DAX 30 and 21 of the CAC 40.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We estimate SMEs represented approximately 50% of our TTV in 2022. The SME segment is highly competitive and fragmented, but we believe we have one of the most compelling offerings to SME client bases in B2B travel. Through our Ovation and Egencia acquisitions in 2021, we have reaffirmed our commitment to building a leading presence in the SME segment. Our SME-focused diverse portfolio of leading travel management services are also well positioned in premium segments and across various industries. For example, 58 of the AmLaw 100 law firms are Lawyers Travel and American Express Global Business Travel clients (“The 2021 Am Law 100: Ranked by Gross Revenue,” April 2021, The American Lawyer).
Travel Suppliers: Our travel suppliers include airlines, individual hotels and hotel groups, hotel aggregators, car rental companies, rail transportation providers and all three major GDSs. Our longstanding and valuable supplier relationships allow us to benefit from our marketplace with one of the largest concentrations of premium demand in travel. We believe that business demand is differentially important to travel suppliers due to their higher profitability and the high costs of marketing to and serving this demand directly. We are not only one of the largest single sources of business travel demand globally in terms of TTV, but we believe we also have a higher value (in terms of average ticket value and share of first and business class cabins) client base compared to the typical B2B travel benchmark.
Our value to travel suppliers is built on efficient access to premium business travelers, combined with solutions that help them effectively market their content and service offerings, including:

● | A technology platform distributing content to our business clients across a wide range of POS;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Managing a highly complex retail environment on behalf of travel suppliers, including client-specific content, fares and POS integrations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Analytics and other solutions that help travel suppliers make better retail decisions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Acting as an extension of the supplier salesforce to our clients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Superior capabilities that allow us to service those clients in challenging or unpredictable environments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe we offer access to and service this premium demand more cost-effectively, and with a broader and deeper value proposition, than travel suppliers could themselves. We allow travel suppliers to avoid significant investment in marketing, technology, servicing resources and infrastructure. This in turn helps drive superior value and economics for travel suppliers and our clients who benefit from savings and extra amenities and perks, such as complimentary Wi-Fi, breakfast, last-room availability and loyalty benefits, compared to publicly available fares.

17



Network Partners: Through GBT Partner Solutions, we extend our platform, including our negotiated content, supplier contracts and distribution and POS retailing technology to approximately 125 Network Partners and have servicing relationships and partnerships with over 150 TMC’s in our TPN in various jurisdictions across the globe. We believe the GBT Partner Solutions value proposition is compelling for Network Partners by providing:

● | Significantly improved revenue capacity through better content management and retailing capabilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Differentiated content and experiences that distinguish our Network Partners from their competitors; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Technology designed to solve critical problems for TMCs that are less capable of making these investments.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Model
As noted in the graphic below, our value proposition creates our competitive advantage and is driven by the synergies that drive value for all users of our platform.


● | We deliver value to all our clients through our high-quality service, comprehensive and exclusive content and experiences, savings on travel spend and differentiated technology-enabled solutions. We deliver this through the compelling combination of tailored value propositions targeted at attractive client segments in business travel reinforced by our diverse portfolio of leading travel management services, and the significant value created by the GBT platform that powers our services and our Network Partners.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have one of the largest concentrations of premium demand in travel worldwide. Business travel is important to travel suppliers due to its significant contribution to profitability driven by more first and business class cabin bookings, fewer advance purchases and more flexible tickets. By aggregating business travel demand, we are a valuable partner to travel suppliers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our platform provides travel suppliers with efficient access to our valuable client base, creating a strong incentive for travel suppliers to deliver more content, better experiences and increased savings. Serving high value business clients is a significant investment in technology, service resources, infrastructure and capabilities. The volume of business travel we manage and our efficient platform enable us to make and sustain this investment at compelling economics for both clients and travel suppliers. This creates margin headroom for travel suppliers to offer differentiated value through savings, content and experiences commensurate with the differentiated value of this demand to them. These savings and benefits make our value proposition even more compelling for our clients. Moreover, we benefit from premium economics and capacity to invest in our platform and in inorganic expansion of platform scale and capability. Our clients and suppliers benefit from the

incremental value created by these investments through more services and solutions, better client and traveler experiences and a more efficient platform.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our end-to-end ownership of our technology platform, from connectivity to sources that supply to our POS, allows us to deploy investments efficiently and generate extensive benefits for our clients and travel suppliers. In addition, our strategic acquisitions help us build scale and add capabilities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that our continued innovation and development of our platform makes us more competitive.
Our Revenue Model
We generate revenue in two primary ways — (1) fees and other revenues relating to processing and servicing travel transactions (“Travel Revenues”) received from clients and travel suppliers and (2) revenues for the provision of products and professional services not directly related to transactions (“Product and Professional Services Revenues”) received from clients, travel suppliers and Network Partners.
Travel Revenues: Travel Revenues are proportionally back in line with pre-pandemic levels and include all revenue relating to servicing a travel transaction, which can be air, hotel, car rental, rail or other travel-related bookings or reservations, cancellations, exchanges or refunds. The major components of our Travel Revenues are:

● | Client Fees: We typically charge clients transaction fees for arranging travel.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Supplier Fees: Travel suppliers pay us for distributing and promoting their content. The mechanism varies by supplier, but the amount is usually a volume-linked fee. This includes fees from the three major GDSs.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Product and Professional Services Revenues: We receive revenue from clients, travel suppliers and Network Partners for using our platform, products and value-added services, which comprised 24% of our revenues in 2019.

● | Management Fees: Many clients request a contractually fixed, dedicated staffing pool to serve their travelers for part or all of their business travel. In these cases, we use a cost-recovery-plus-margin pricing structure instead of a transaction fee. Client management resources and overhead allocations are also included in this management fee.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Products Revenues: We provide a broad range of business travel management tools used by clients to manage their travel programs. Revenue for these solutions usually takes the form of recurring subscriptions or management fees.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Consulting and Meetings and Events Revenues: Consulting revenues (including outsourcing to us of part, or all, of a client’s travel program management) are usually a fixed fee for delivery of a certain engagement (such as company travel policy design). Meetings and events revenue is based on fees for booking, planning and managing meetings and events.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Other Revenues: Other revenues typically include certain marketing and advertising fees from travel suppliers, as well as direct revenues from our Network Partners (excludes certain supplier fees that are indirectly driven by Network Partners’ contribution to aggregate volumes).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technology
Since the formation of the JV in 2014, we have spent approximately $1.4 billion, including Egencia, on product and platform, to create a global platform that powers travel distribution, servicing and business travel programs. We continue to implement focused, 

19



high-impact enhancements to our technology platform and solutions in order to continually improve our value proposition to our clients, travel suppliers and Network Partners.
Technology Investments Create a Sustainable Competitive Advantage
Our technology investment has centered on three key strategic goals:

● | Creating a custom-built technology infrastructure to power our platform and maintain robust privacy and data security;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Developing an omnichannel core platform capable of powering a global travel program at scale, including an e-commerce platform that provides content for our clients and seamless distribution for our travel suppliers; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Creating seamless travel experiences founded upon an integrated suite of digital products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We began with a product and technology strategy to own all core needs and develop a modern, agile, flexible, globally consistent and secure platform. In 2016, we released the first phase of our omnichannel core platform, which today consists of our global profile solution, global trip record repository, and GBT Supply MarketPlace with content and an expansive data repository that houses most of our trip and traveler data. The core platform is designed to support our own proprietary solutions as well as an ecosystem of third-party products and solutions in order to offer clients the broadest choice in how they design and configure their travel programs.
In 2018, we completed the full separation of our infrastructure from American Express, including our global telephony systems and network.
Over the last two years, we have accelerated our strategy of delivering capabilities to our clients, travel suppliers and Network Partners. We relaunched KDS (acquired in 2016) as NTG in 2019. NTG is our innovation engine and the center of excellence for all of our digital and e-commerce development. In 2020, we added new features to support clients and travelers during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Travel Vitals, which delivers critical travel information and advisories.
With the completion of the Egencia Acquisition, we strengthened our digital and e-commerce capabilities; Egencia brings a compelling and integrated end-to-end B2B software solution to our clients. The synergies we gain from the Egencia Acquisition are underpinned by a platform and innovation capability designed to serve travelers and clients with a differentiated digital experience in target segments, and is highly complementary and accretive to our business. For additional information, see “Business — Egencia Acquisition”.
We currently offer over 50 distinct technology-enabled products intended to address specific, high- impact problems for our clients. In addition to these capabilities, we support seamless integrations with over 100 third-party solutions that are commonly used 

20



by our clients. Our products and third-party integrations continue to grow as travel programs and needs evolve, and our core platform is central to our ability to quickly and efficiently develop, deploy and improve solutions across our client base globally.
We have a robust set of global capabilities that meet the needs of some of the most sophisticated global travel programs as well as the most digitally savvy frequent travelers. Travel management solutions include policy and compliance management, trip approvals, unused ticket management, full featured reporting (including data, analytics and insights), traveler care tools designed to help ensure traveler safety and wellbeing, and continuous rate search. For the traveler, a digital suite of solutions enables information, communication, booking and travel management where they want it to be: online, on mobile and by e-mail, as well as by chat with travel counselors through GBT’s Mobile App, iMessage, Android Message, WhatsApp and additional channels. Our platform also supports our travel counselors, which enables personalized servicing, proactive traveler care (we reach out to travelers during disruptions before they even know to call us) and robust transaction services all supported by workforce management tools.
Our Competitive Strengths
We attribute our success and historical performance to the following key strengths that we believe differentiate us from our competition:

--+--------------------------------------------------

World’s Leading B2B Travel Platform by 2021 TTV with a Diverse Portfolio of Leading Travel Management Services Serving Business Clients
According to Travel Weekly, based on 2021 TTV, we are the world’s leading B2B travel platform and one of the leading platforms in travel (after leading B2C travel platforms such as Expedia Group and Booking Holdings). We offer solutions for demand and supply fragmentation, designed to provide travel suppliers with a cost-efficient channel to reach business clients and business travelers, and we own parts of the distribution value chain, including technology, that enable us to differentiate our service and deliver excellence in client and traveler experiences. We deliver an expansive suite of professional and technology services to clients in addition to superior traveler services. We believe these capabilities and services increase the value of our B2B model.
We distinguish ourselves from other B2B travel providers through our portfolio of solutions that target premium demand segments in business travel with tailored and leading value propositions.
We serve a range of business clients and offer complete business travel solutions that can be designed and configured around client needs and fully integrated into client environments.

21



Our Ovation offering (including the Lawyers Travel service) focus on SME clients specializing in providing high-touch service at scale with deep strength in selected industries, including the legal, private equity and entertainment industries.
Egencia is focused on integrated software solutions for SMEs. The Egencia platform is simple and easy to use, provides the “look and feel” of a consumer platform for travelers, and features intuitive integrated travel management solutions. Egencia was designed and built as a software solution for SMEs.
We supplement our diverse portfolio of leading travel management services, which target attractive segments in B2B travel, with our GBT Partner Solutions proposition. We believe that the combination of our brands and partner solutions provides us with growth options, scalability and capacity for investment in our platform that powers the GBT Flywheel and distinguishes us from our competitors.
High-quality Client Base with Track Record of Attractive Retention Rates and New Business Growth
Through our diverse portfolio of leading travel management services, we serve a broad range of business clients globally across a diverse range of industries including, among others, business and financial services, industrial, technology, healthcare, legal and other industries.
Our value propositions are tailored to meet the sophisticated needs of business travel clients, which in turn are valuable to our travel suppliers.
We believe the strength of our value proposition is demonstrated by our track record of attracting and retaining premium demand business clients. Our client retention rate was 95% in 2022. The average tenure of our top 100 clients by TTV is approximately 14 years with more than 76% of our client relationships having a tenure of more than five years. In addition to maintaining our existing clients, our Total New Wins Value for full year 2022 totaled $3.5 billion at current recovery levels with an average win / loss ratio of 2.5x since 2015.
Our commitment to supporting our clients through the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced our value proposition and strengthened our brand and reputation, as demonstrated by our sustained high win rate and client satisfaction ranking through 2020 to date. Specifically, per the July-August 2021 survey commissioned by APSG, the net promoter scores, which measure customer experience and are an indicator of our ability to win new customers and grow with existing customers, was 56 and 52 for Egencia and GBT respectively, each of which were at least three points higher than the closest competitors. In addition, we continue to maintain our strong client retention results.
Traveler-Centric, Omnichannel Service Model
We are proud to offer our travelers 24/7 customer service anywhere in the world through a number of service channels. In 2022, 75% of our bookings were through digital channels (such as online booking tools (“OBTs”), the GBT mobile app and instant messaging), including Egencia. Alongside our digital channels, our agent facilitated channels have played a critical role is supporting travelers seeking the expertise and support of our travel counselors in navigating a more complex travel environment.
Our platform is channel-agnostic, ensuring travelers and clients benefit from the full range of our content, savings and solutions regardless of how they choose to engage with us. Where it is valued by our clients, our platform also integrates seamlessly with all major third-party OBTs as well as Neo, further enhancing our flexibility.
Our travel counselors are experienced specialists in B2B travel and provide 24/7 global support capabilities. Our service constructs are flexible to match client needs. Within our global client solutions, our tools and infrastructure allow travel counselors to serve any client or traveler anywhere, to the high standard our clients expect of us. Where our clients require deep, personal knowledge of their business and travelers, we dedicate travel counselors to their account and offer on-site service.
Our service footprint includes 31 countries where we have a proprietary presence or operations. Our TPN, which is integrated into our infrastructure and platform, extends this service footprint to our clients in the rest of the world. This broad geographic reach allows us to offer streamlined access to a consistent portfolio of services across the globe and a differentiated local service where such service is needed and valued by the traveler and client.

22



Our traveler interactions are captured within and powered by our core platform, which is fully integrated into all service channels. This allows seamless, simple and efficient cross channel engagement for our travelers (for example, booking a trip through the OBT, changing the itinerary by calling a travel counselor and rebooking a connecting flight through messaging). In 2020, we acquired 30STF, a cutting-edge AI and machine learning enabled messaging tool, to further enhance our capabilities.
Relationships with Top-Tier Travel Suppliers Driven by Value Proposition
We believe that our longstanding supplier relationships, built on a track record of delivering premium demand, improving profitability and meeting supplier objectives, differentiate us from our competitors.
These relationships include airlines, hotel groups and individual hotel properties, content aggregators, including Expedia Partner Solutions and Booking.com, all three major GDS platforms, car rental, rail, ground transportation companies and many other travel suppliers.
Travel suppliers value business travel demand due to a higher proportion of first and business class cabin bookings, fewer advance purchases, more flexible tickets and more long-haul international bookings, all of which drive superior economics and profitability. For example, according to Skift Research, business travelers may have driven 55% to 75% of profits for major airlines prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, even though they represent a minority of bookings. As the world’s leading B2B travel platform by 2021 TTV, we offer travel suppliers access to one of the largest aggregations of this premium demand in the travel industry. Moreover, we believe the composition of our bookings is uniquely valuable compared to typical B2B bookings. Due to the nature and mix of our client types, our clients typically choose premium tickets that we estimate are on average approximately 40% higher than the average TMC booking. In addition, more than half of our TTV related to air travel is derived from first and business class cabin bookings.
We offer travel suppliers efficient access to this premium demand. For example, we estimate that the total distribution cost through us is comparable (as a percentage of booking value) to the reported selling costs for at least our top five airline clients and even more cost-effective when considering the technology investment and servicing cost savings our travel suppliers realize.
These high value relationships and economics are powered by the GBT Supply MarketPlace, our unified platform encompassing the GDS and non-GDS content aggregation that connects all of our travel suppliers and content to the POS our clients and travelers use. We believe this provides value to travel suppliers by eliminating the need to invest in complex business client POS environments while also providing them with the capabilities they need to market, promote and sell their content, products and services effectively.
We have extensive experience working closely with travel suppliers to deliver their objectives and create value for clients. We have a dedicated team of proprietary content acquisition and revenue management specialists providing data insight, backed by advanced optimization tools and data analytics that deliver compelling solutions to travel suppliers.
We believe our offerings create a strong incentive for travel suppliers to deliver more content, experiences, and savings specifically for our clients. This includes Preferred Extras that are not available to the general public, which provides clients with value through extra amenities and savings from exclusive fares. For example, more than 90 airlines and more than 60,000 hotel properties participated in the Preferred Extras program, with clients benefiting from an average saving of approximately 7% compared to public fares when they used Preferred Extras content, in addition to benefiting from extra amenities and perks such as free Wi- Fi, breakfast, last-room availability and loyalty benefits.
Cutting-Edge Proprietary Technology Platform Seamlessly Integrated into our Operations
Business clients and travelers expect a single integrated global platform to drive seamless experiences and integration with their chosen systems. Our approach provides a differentiated mix of a full end-to-end proprietary solution set as well as a flexible architecture integrating the myriad third-party solutions that our clients request. We believe the capacity to offer both end-to-end proprietary solutions and global, seamless integrations is a differentiator relative to our competitors.
Our core platform is the foundation of our ability to deliver this value. The core platform sits at the heart of our business and is custom-built to integrate with our solutions and the technology ecosystems of business clients, travel suppliers and technology 

23



partners, providing seamless experiences and technology- enabled solutions. The core platform demonstrates how the GBT Flywheel enables enhanced investment in our technology to drive better outcomes for our clients and travel suppliers.
By increasingly owning both the traveler experience (whether through Neo, GBT Mobile or Chat) and the distribution technology (through the GBT Supply MarketPlace), we deliver content to travelers the way they want it. This technology makes us one of the few TMCs to have a full digital POS solution and content delivery technology. Our technology allows us to control our digital roadmap, including with respect to content aggregation, and user experiences with merchandising and retailing of content to generate the maximum benefit for travelers, clients and travel suppliers. Owning this technology drives efficiencies in our own operations and provides us with a unique position in the marketplace by supporting the distribution needs of travel suppliers, as well as enhancing the quality of the user experience and driving savings for our clients and their travelers.
On top of the platform is a full digital solution set, for both traveler satisfaction and productivity enhancement. This allows us to offer self-service solutions or agent facilitated interactions through all the channels that travelers want: online, through GBT’s Mobile App or through e-mail or chat. We also have end- to-end digital solutions that enable full travel spend visibility, control and compliance and support our clients’ travel management needs, such as traveler tracking, reporting and insights, travel approvals, continuous rate search and unused ticket tracking. We continuously build on our expansive data repository and we deploy extensive data analytics, including sustainability metrics, to generate actionable insights and improve our products. Our proprietary technology utilizes data analytics capabilities to enhance travel program insights and create a more personalized user experience, which we believe will drive our client reach.
We also offer clients the ability to integrate third-party solutions such as SAP Concur. We seamlessly integrate these solutions, as well as links to core client systems, such as finance and HR applications, via our flexible Application Programming Interfaces to drive consistent client and traveler experiences. By doing so, we can quickly adapt to client needs while also maintaining robust information security, privacy and compliance safeguards.
Acquired in 2021, Egencia is the world’s leading digital travel management solution providing a strong strategic fit with the GBT platform. The Egencia platform was built as a fully integrated B2B travel software solution. It is differentiated from GBT’s historical solutions because it primarily focuses on digital-first clients (more than 90% of transactions were served through digital channels in 2022) who value a simple, easy to use and integrated standardized end-to-end solution. This approach is highly complementary to the GBT platform, which is modular solution primarily focused on flexibility and configurability of service offerings.
Industry-Leading Standard of Sustainability
On an annual basis, GBT publishes an Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Report, which includes our ESG strategy and progress in respect of environmental sustainability, diversity, equity and inclusion, and corporate governance matters. This report follows leading ESG frameworks including the United Nations Global Compact, the Global Reporting Initiative, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting guidelines. We continuously identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities as well as pursue initiatives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion – for all of our stakeholders. GBT has been awarded a platinum rating by EcoVadis, placing our company in the top 1% of assessed companies on corporate social responsibility and sustainable procurement.
Our clients and suppliers are some of the most forward-thinking leaders on corporate environmental and sustainability issues. Alongside more than 4,000 business and financial institutions, GBT has committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and we are working to reduce our emissions in line with climate science. Beyond value chain mitigation, we were amongst the first global travel management companies to offset 100% of carbon emissions for our own business travel. Starting in 2019, we achieved carbon neutrality for our employees’ business travel by purchasing and retiring carbon credits sufficient to account for the estimated carbon emissions associated with our employees’ business travel for the applicable years. We also provide expertise and an efficient marketplace for green business travel and strive to be a catalyst for, and enabler of, industry wide progress. To promote our and our clients’ mutual commitment to a more sustainable future for business travel, we offer an ever-expanding suite of sustainable travel services and solutions, including:

● | Proprietary tools for measuring carbon footprint and options to filter travel by carbon emission levels built into Neo;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

24




● | Access to carbon offset programs that enable our clients to purchase carbon offsets directly; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industry-leading sustainability consulting, analytics and meetings and events proposition, including Green Compass;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solutions designed to decarbonize the travel sector, including the 2022 launch of Avelia, one of the world’s first blockchain-powered book-and-claim digital platforms designed to help scale the supply and demand of sustainable aviation fuel, in collaboration with our clients and industry partners.

Attractive Financial Profile with Diversified Revenue Streams and a Flexible Cost Structure
Our types and sources of revenue are highly diversified. We receive revenue from clients, travel suppliers and Network Partners for air, hotel, car rental, rail or other travel-related transactions as well as a broad range of non-transaction related products and services. No single client accounted for more than 2% of our revenue in 2022.
Travel Revenues are primarily driven by transaction volumes, with volume floors included in some of our client contracts. Product and Professional Services Revenues, which constituted 24% of our total revenue in 2019, 41% of our total revenue in 2020, 42% of our total revenue in 2021 and 22% of our total revenue in 2022, are not directly driven by transaction volume. This revenue mix allows us to mitigate volume downside risk while benefiting from growth in our business as well as the underlying growth in the B2B travel industry.
Business resilience is further enhanced by our flexible cost structure, enabling us to quickly and efficiently react to changes in the demand for travel management services. For information regarding the cost-reduction measures we took in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Business — Recent Performance and COVID-19 Update” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations — Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.”
Management Team with Industry-Leading Experience
We are led by a highly experienced management team with a track record of delivering results. The team has diverse backgrounds and experiences, both from inside and outside the travel industry.
They have successfully managed the business through the formation of the JV, as well as through several acquisitions and transformations, while delivering consistent growth. They have also deftly managed the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic together, taking roles as industry leaders in supporting the emerging resurgence of travel, and have the expertise and leadership required to execute on our growth strategy.
Our Growth Strategy
We believe GBT has significant runway for growth and margin expansion opportunity, enabled by our differentiated industry position. Our growth strategy is focused on realizing this opportunity through multiple levers to drive growth, accelerating our new wins with our strengthened value proposition and industry tailwinds from increased need for high quality managed travel solutions, growing our leadership in the large and fast-growing SME segment, further benefiting from shifts towards managed travel in these segments, delivering further value through M&A and expanding our GBT Partner Solutions business. We are also positioned to be a more profitable business and drive margin expansion through the structural cost reductions undertaken during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling higher underlying margins compared to 2019, a proven approach to delivering synergies to drive value from recent and future M&A, a modern and agile technology platform well- equipped to drive sustained productivity improvements and increasing exposure to the high margin SME segment.
We regularly consider acquisition opportunities as well as other forms of business combinations. Historically, we have been involved in numerous transactions of various magnitudes, for consideration which included cash, securities or combinations thereof. We are continuing to evaluate and to pursue appropriate acquisition and combination opportunities as they arise in the expansion of our operations. No assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or financial or business effect of any possible transaction. As part of our regular on-going evaluation of acquisition opportunities, we are currently engaged in a number of unrelated preliminary discussions concerning possible acquisitions. We are in the early stages of such discussions and have not entered into any 

25



agreement with respect to any possible acquisitions not expressly described in this Annual Report. The purchase price for possible acquisitions may be paid in cash, through the issuance of equity, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, or a combination thereof. Prior to consummating any such possible acquisition, we, among other things, will have to satisfactorily complete our due diligence investigation, negotiate the financial and other terms (including price) and conditions of such acquisitions, obtain necessary consents and approvals and, if necessary, obtain financing. The fact that we are subject to supervision, examination and regulation by Federal Reserve under the BHC Act could limit our ability to engage in acquisition activity (See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Regulatory, Tax and Litigation Matters — Because we are deemed to be “controlled” by American Express under the BHC Act, we are and will be subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve which could adversely affect our future growth and our business, results of operations and financial condition”). Furthermore, our ability to consummate and finance acquisitions may be limited by the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements. We cannot predict if any such acquisition will be consummated or, if consummated, will result in a financial or other benefit to us. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Employee Matters, Managing Our Growth and Other Risks Relating to Our Business — We may be unable to identify and consummate new acquisition opportunities, which would significantly impact our growth strategy.”
Capitalize on our Differentiated Value Proposition and Technology Platform
Since the formation of the JV, we have invested approximately $1.4 billion in product and platform, to deliver the leading B2B travel platform, including exceptional traveler experience and leading travel program management tools and capabilities. Our proprietary technology utilizes data analytics capabilities to enhance travel program insights and create a more personalized user experience, which we believe will drive our client reach. We intend to expand our value proposition through the continued integration of travel and expense and payment tools. In addition, the GBT Supply MarketPlace aggregates and optimizes content delivery, which we believe will solve critical problems for business clients, travel suppliers and Network Partners.
With increased capabilities and functionality, we can deliver more value for our clients and potentially capture a higher share of travel spend from our clients. Our efforts are evidenced in strong retention and business growth rates. We believe that continuing to invest in our digital transformation will also improve client satisfaction while reducing costs. We plan to continue expanding our technology suite in order to seamlessly deliver on clients’ needs in each target segment and to execute on opportunities designed to further improve profitability.
Strengthen Position in Global and Multinational Segment
We believe our value proposition to business clients was strengthened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which underscored our high-quality service and created a flight to service quality, where quality of service became highly prioritized as a critical buying factor. As a result of this paradigm shift, newly won client expected annual value and growth in client and traveler satisfaction performance has strengthened compared to our pre-pandemic trend. We provide one of the most complete business travel solutions for business clients, and we believe our differentiated value proposition will enable us to continue to grow in this segment. Business clients require sophisticated capabilities on a global scale, and we believe that we can deliver them through our platform and solutions, high-quality traveler service and suite of professional services.
We plan to continue to grow through new client wins and expanding upon our existing relationships by providing more comprehensive solutions, including meetings and events planning, consulting, outsourced services and more products and technology that are integrated into our clients to provide the best possible experience and value.
Accelerate Penetration in SME Segment
We are focused on growth in the SME segment, which we believe represents a large and profitable opportunity for our business. In 2019, estimated global SME total travel spend was approximately $945 billion, including both significant managed and unmanaged spend. We estimate $675 million of the global SME segment is unmanaged, representing a large growth opportunity.
Ovation (including the Ovation and Lawyers Travel services) and Egencia, are two of our SME-focused acquisitions in 2021 that demonstrate our commitment and ability to execute in the SME segment. Ovation and Lawyers Travel are leading solutions for the high-touch segment where personal, human service remains a key buying criterion. Egencia is a leading SME software platform where a largely self-service model is desired. GBT, together with Ovation and Egencia, has the capability of serving SMEs with a variety of solutions designed to meet their needs.

26



We launched Neo1, a fully self-registered SME expense management tool in the UK in 2020 and in the U.S. in 2021.
With these two businesses and our SME expense management tool, we intend to unlock significant potential in the SME segment through new business development with unmanaged clients and increasing value with our existing client base.
Accelerate the Deployment of our GBT Partner Solutions Platform
We believe there is significant opportunity to further expand our GBT Partner Solutions platform to serve other TMCs and drive high-margin growth due to the high degree of fragmentation within the travel industry. We believe there is strong demand for partnerships driven by investment constraints of other TMCs, content fragmentation and the increased technology needs of the client. We view GBT Partner Solutions as an opportunity to appeal to unmanaged SME clients through our Network Partners while further establishing us as an important outsourced supplier to the industry for premium products, services and content.
With increased scale through third-party travel agency partnerships, we can improve our broader economics from a larger aggregate volume base, increased return on investment and broadened geographic reach with a more global footprint. This has helped increase the scale of our platform and provided attractive margins and capital efficient growth.
Pursue Strategic and Accretive M&A
We have historically built scale and added capabilities through M&A activity and expect to continue to pursue strategic opportunities to complement our platform. We have demonstrated an ability to execute accretive and synergistic acquisitions as well as integrate and fundamentally improve our acquired businesses.
We intend to broaden our diverse portfolio of leading travel management services and our geographic reach, which will allow us to add more business clients and travel suppliers to our platform, driving top-line growth as well as enhancing our technology capabilities and value proposition to deliver increasing value across our client base. We actively monitor and evaluate our M&A pipeline across all our strategic pillars for key opportunities in SME, high growth regions and technology capabilities. Our industry is highly fragmented with hundreds of TMCs, providing a large and attractive pool of potential M&A opportunities. We believe there remains significant M&A opportunity in the business travel industry and adjacent industries that could continue to create growth opportunities for us in the future. This provides a large opportunity to target strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and partnerships to improve our geographic footprint and capabilities. We may be required to raise additional capital through new equity or the incurrence of additional indebtedness to support our acquisition strategy.
Earnings Growth Through Productivity and Automation
We have ongoing digital transformation and automation initiatives to increase efficiency in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, by bringing more solutions from our core platform into our travel counselor toolkit, we can automate more processes, as well as create more self-service and “co-pilot” solutions for travel counselors that combine automation with human service. We believe this type of servicing delivers the best of both worlds in achieving traveler satisfaction and efficiency.
Together, these initiatives will enable us to deliver a higher level of service, thus benefiting clients, travelers and our business. Combined with the structural cost reductions delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we are in a strong position to realize and maintain higher margins going forward.

On November 1, 2021, EAN.com LP, an affiliate of Expedia, entered into that certain Marketing Partner Agreement, which is a ten-year term marketing partner agreement with an affiliate of GBT to provide GBT’s clients with access to Expedia Group hotel content through the GBT Supply MarketPlace, which requires EAN.com LP to meet certain competitiveness thresholds with respect to the Expedia Group hotel content offered to GBT and requires GBT to satisfy certain share of wallet commitments to EAN.com LP.
As part of the Egencia Acquisition, on November 1, 2021, GBT UK entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Expedia, Inc. (the “Egencia TSA”), pursuant to which Expedia, Inc. (an affiliate of Expedia) and its affiliates provide certain transition services to facilitate an orderly transfer of Egencia from Expedia, Inc. to GBT.
The Egencia Acquisition represents our ninth acquisition since the formation of the JV in June 2014, demonstrating GBT’s ability to identify highly strategic targets and successfully execute on value-enhancing M&A.
Recent Performance and COVID-19 Update
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused material declines in demand within the travel industry and has consequently adversely and materially affected our business, results of operations and financial condition since March 2020. Historically, significant events affecting travel, such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the 2003 outbreak of SARS, have an impact on booking patterns, with the full extent of the impact generally determined by the length of time the event and related government and societal reactions influence travel decisions. However, after each event business travel spend has recovered and continued to grow. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse effect on the travel industry, global travel bookings and on our business, financial condition and operating results. Some adverse effect is likely to continue until the spread of COVID-19 is further contained and may continue thereafter, particularly if government regulation of, and employer and employee attitudes toward, business travel change in a lasting way. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption of teleconference and virtual meeting technologies significantly increased. The extent of permanent, structural substitution of business travel by such alternatives, if any, remains uncertain. In the three months ended December 31, 2022, transaction volumes recovered to 72% compared to the same period for 2019, and 82% recovered for the SME customer base. The trend continues to be positive with some key geographies still in the process of relaxing 

28



tight travel restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, the speed of the full recovery or extent of any permanent impact on demand remains difficult to predict until industry recovery in key geographies and segments is more advanced. In addition, we are seeing many clients adopt hybrid meetings, which include a combination of in-person and virtual attendees. For additional information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry.”
While the full recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is inherently uncertain, with vaccinations and new treatments containing COVID-19, we believe the longer-term opportunity for us remains strong. Our customer service was especially valuable to travelers since the start of the pandemic - during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 we repatriated more than 100,000 travelers and have continued to effectively support travelers through periods of high disruption. Our traveler satisfaction averaged 92% since 2020, the highest since the formation of the JV in 2014. We are confident in the future of business travel as the estimated $1.4 trillion industry opportunity as of 2019 provides ample runway for growth. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the need for high-quality travel management solutions with a focus on employee safety and well-being will be more important than ever. In addition, with our additional capabilities in the SME segment, we believe the opportunity for us to leverage these capabilities and grow the SME business is substantial.
Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, we took immediate action to reduce our operating expenses and preserve cash through our COVID-19 Business Response Plan (the “COVID-19 BRP”). These actions reduced the 2020 and 2021 operating expenses by $574 million and $605 million, respectively, compared to the same time period of 2019, representing a reduction of 33% in 2020 and 34% in 2021, demonstrating the flexibility in our operating model. “Total Operating Expenses” is defined as excluding depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges, net of the incremental operating expenses from the Egencia and Ovation acquisitions, consisting of reductions of salary and benefits and other operating expenses costs reductions. Restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily related to severance costs incurred for headcount reduction and impairment charges from closures of certain of our offices. Key action items spanned: (i) employee cost-reduction measures (including salary and hiring freezes, pay reductions, furloughs and headcount reductions and other adjustments to salary and benefits), (ii) vendor cost-reduction measures (including vendor contract renegotiations, harmonization of mid- and back-office activities, technology and real estate rationalization) and (iii) other cost-reduction measures (including with respect to non-essential capital expenditures). Such actions are expected to result in $235 million of annualized permanent cost reductions at full recovery that were delivered through structural efficiency gains, which we believe will enhance the underlying profitability of our business going forward.
We continue to win new business by strengthening our value proposition for business clients, travel suppliers and Network Partners. In 2022, we significantly strengthened customer value. We delivered

(a) | Total New Wins Value of $3.5 billion at current recovery levels,
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | 95% customer retention rate in 2022,
----+-------------------------------------


(c) | over 90% customer satisfaction score (excludes Egencia and Ovation), and
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


(d) | major new customer wins.
----+-------------------------

As a way to continue to grow the business, we continuously sell our solutions and services to organizations that currently do not manage their travel program with GBT. We measure new sales in terms of the average annual spend expected to be served under the contract over its term, which is usually three years, as estimated by clients. Given the recovery trajectory in the near term, the standard practice adopted by clients since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has been to quantify spend in terms of 2019 benchmark. We have followed this practice in how we value new wins.
Liquidity Update
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on preserving liquidity to ensure that we emerge as a stronger competitor and maximize flexibility to react to the shape of the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

29



On May 27, 2022, we completed our Business Combination transaction. After considering payments of certain transaction expenses and redemption of GBT JerseyCo’s preferred shares of $168 million (including accrued dividends thereon until the Closing Date), we received net proceeds of $128 million upon Closing.
On January 25, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement (the “Senior Secured Credit Agreement Amendment”) to, among other things, provide additional term loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to $135 million to be used for general corporate purposes. The additional term loans made under the newly established tranche B-4 term facility have substantially the same terms as the existing loans under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement’s tranche B-3 term facility after giving effect to the amendment. The amendment also extended the maturity of the $50 million revolving credit facility under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement from August 2023 to September 2026, subject to a springing maturity provision. The revolving credit facility will automatically terminate on May 14, 2025 if the initial term loans under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement have not been refinanced, replaced or extended (with a resulting maturity date that is December 16, 2026 or later) or repaid in full prior to May 14, 2025. The revolving credit facility remained undrawn as of December 31, 2022.
The amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement described above suspended the testing of our leverage-based financial covenant through July 1, 2024 (unless we elect to demonstrate compliance on an earlier date). Additionally, the amendment imposed further conditions to draw under our revolving credit facility during the suspension period, including minimum and maximum liquidity requirements and prohibitions on certain restricted payments and debt incurrences. Utilization of our revolving credit facility may be effectively limited in future periods if we are unable to comply with the additional borrowing conditions that apply during the suspension period or with the leverage- and liquidity-based financial covenant requirements for such facility contained in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement when required.
The proceeds from these financing arrangements have been and will continue to be used to reinforce our liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility. We believe this additional flexibility will be important given our limited ability to predict our future financial performance due to the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $303 million, which represents a decrease of $213 million compared to cash and cash equivalents of $516 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by cash outflows from our operating and investing activities.
While it remains difficult to predict the precise path to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and certain changes in business practices may become permanent, we remain confident that travel will recover and we believe we are well positioned to respond to rapidly evolving scenarios. We continue to believe we will play a critical role in that recovery and beyond by continuing to actively support our clients, partners and employees worldwide.
We believe, based on our current operating plan, that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and cash flows from operating activities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital, financial liabilities, capital expenditures and business expansion for at least the next 12 months. Although we believe that we will have a sufficient level of cash and cash equivalents to cover our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business and to continue to expand our business, we may, from time to time, explore additional financing sources to lower our cost of capital, which could include equity, equity-linked and debt financing. In addition, from time to time, we may evaluate acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. If we elect to pursue any such investments, we may fund them with internally generated funds, bank financing, the issuance of other debt or equity or a combination thereof. There is no assurance that such funding would be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we would be able to satisfy or obtain a waiver of applicable borrowing conditions for borrowing additional amounts under the unused commitments under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement in the future. In addition, utilization of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility may be effectively limited to the extent we are unable to comply with the additional borrowing conditions that apply during the suspension period or with the leverage- and liquidity-based financial covenant requirements for such facility contained in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement when required.
There is also no assurance whether or when the GBTG MIP Options may be exercised, which could impact our liquidity position. To the extent that the GBTG MIP Options are exercised on a “cashless basis,” the amount of cash we would receive from the exercise of the GBTG MIP Options will decrease. We believe the likelihood that GBTG MIP Option holders will exercise their GBTG MIP Options, and therefore the amount of cash proceeds that we would receive is, among other things, dependent upon the market 

30



price of our Class A Common Stock. If the market price for our Class A Common Stock is less than the applicable exercise price ($7.23 to $14.58 for the GBTG MIP Options), we believe such holders will be unlikely to exercise their GBTG MIP Options, as applicable.

Description of Certain Indebtedness
The following is a summary of the material terms of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and related amendments thereto as of the date of this Annual Report. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and the amendments thereto, all of which are included as exhibits to this Annual Report. You are urged to read carefully the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and the amendments thereto in their entirety.
Senior Secured Credit Agreement
On August 13, 2018, certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, by and among GBT Group Services B.V. (the “Borrower”), GBT III, as the original parent guarantor, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and as collateral agent, and the lenders and letter of credit issuers from time to time party thereto, which initially provided for $250 million of Senior Secured Initial Term Loans and the $50 million Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. In December 2019, the Senior Secured Credit Agreement was modified to, among other things, permit certain internal reorganization transactions and add GBT UK TopCo Limited, a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of GBT, as the parent guarantor. On September 4, 2020, $400 million of Senior Secured Prior Tranche B-1 Term Loans were borrowed under an incremental facility that was established pursuant to an amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. On January 20, 2021, the Senior Secured Credit Agreement was further amended to, among other things, (i) establish the $200 million Senior Secured Prior Tranche B-2 Term Loan Facility and (ii) modify certain terms applicable to the Senior Secured Prior Tranche B-1 Term Loans. On December 2, 2021, the Borrower obtained commitments for the $1,000 million Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities. Effective as of December 16, 2021, the Senior Secured Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, establish the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities, a portion of which was applied to refinance and repay in full the Senior Secured Prior Tranche B-1 Term Loans and the Senior Secured Prior Tranche B-2 Term Loan Facility. On January 25, 2023, the Senior Secured Credit Agreement was further amended to, among other things, (i) establish the $135 million Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility (together with the Senior Secured Initial Term Loans and the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities, the “Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities”) and (ii) modify certain terms applicable to the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. The various amendments referred to above also modified certain covenants and certain other terms of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement.
Term Loan Facilities
Senior Secured Initial Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $250 million were drawn in full at the original closing of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, and the proceeds therefrom were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of a then-existing bridge facility that was incurred to finance our July 2018 acquisition of HRG. Loans in an aggregate principal amount of $800 million were drawn under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities on December 16, 2021, a portion of which was applied to refinance and repay in full the Senior Secured Prior Tranche B-1 Term Loans and the Senior Secured Prior Tranche B-2 Term Loan Facility, and, in connection therewith, the remaining unused commitments under the Senior Secured Prior Tranche B-2 Term Loan Facility were terminated. The then remaining $200 million of commitments under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities were available on a delayed-draw basis for an up to six-month period after the initial borrowing date under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities, subject to certain customary borrowing conditions, to be used for ongoing working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes permitted by the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. On May 19, 2022, $100 million of term loans were borrowed from such $200 million of delayed draw commitments under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities. On June 9, 2022, an additional $100 million of term loans were borrowed from the last remaining delayed draw commitments under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities. On January 25, 2023, an additional $135 million of term loans were borrowed under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan 

31



Facility. Lenders under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities and the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility include funds managed or advised by certain affiliates of the Sponsor and affiliates of certain PIPE Investors.
The Senior Secured Initial Term Loans mature, and all amounts outstanding thereunder will become due and payable in full, on August 13, 2025. Principal amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Initial Term Loans are required to be repaid on a quarterly basis at an amortization rate of 1.00% per annum, with the balance due at maturity. The Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities and the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility mature, and all amounts outstanding thereunder will become due and payable in full, on December 16, 2026. Neither the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities nor the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility do not have any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity.
At the option of the Borrower (upon prior written notice), amounts borrowed under one or more of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities (as selected by the Borrower) may be voluntarily prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty (other than (x) any applicable prepayment premium required to be paid with respect to the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities and the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility, as described below, and (y) customary breakage costs in connection with certain prepayments of loans bearing interest at a rate based on LIBOR). Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, the Borrower is required to prepay loans under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facilities with (i) 50% (subject to leverage-based stepdowns) of annual excess cash flow (calculated in a manner set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) in excess of a threshold amount, (ii) 100% (subject to leverage-based stepdowns) of the net cash proceeds from certain asset sales and casualty events, subject to customary reinvestment rights, (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence of certain indebtedness.
Any voluntary prepayment or debt incurrence mandatory prepayment event with respect to any loan under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities or the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility shall be subject to the following prepayment premium: (i) a make-whole amount with respect to any such prepayment prior to the 18-month anniversary of the initial borrowing date under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility equal to 2.25% of the principal amount of the loans under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities or the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility being prepaid plus the present value of the amount of interest that would have been paid on such loan for the period from the date of such prepayment through the end of such 18-month period, and (ii) 2.25% of the principal amount of the loans under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities or the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility being prepaid with respect to any such prepayment on or after the 18-month anniversary, but prior to the 30-month anniversary, of the initial borrowing date under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility. The applicable prepayment premium is also due upon acceleration of the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities or the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility.
As of December 31, 2022, an aggregate principal amount of $241 million of Senior Secured Initial Term Loans and $1,000 million of loans under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities were outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, and there were no unutilized term loan commitments remaining outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement as of such date.
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility has (i) a $30 million sublimit for extensions of credit denominated in certain currencies other than U.S. dollars, (ii) a $10 million sublimit for letters of credit, and (iii) a $10 million sublimit for swingline borrowings.
The January 2023 amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, among other things, suspended the testing of our leverage-based financial covenant through July 1, 2024 (unless we elect to demonstrate compliance on an earlier date). Extensions of credit under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility are generally subject to customary borrowing conditions, but additional borrowing conditions apply during the covenant suspension period, including minimum and maximum liquidity requirements and prohibitions on certain restricted payments and debt incurrences. Any such prohibited restricted payment or debt incurrence would also trigger an automatic reduction to zero of the commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility for the duration of the suspension period, which would give rise to prepayment and/or cash collateral requirements in respect of then-current utilization of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. The proceeds from borrowings under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility matures, and all amounts outstanding thereunder will become due and payable in full, on September 16, 2026, subject to a springing maturity 

32



provision. The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility will automatically terminate on May 14, 2025 if the Senior Secured Initial Term Loans have not been refinanced, replaced or extended (with a resulting maturity date that is December 16, 2026 or later) or repaid in full prior to May 14, 2025. At the option of the Borrower (upon prior written notice), amounts borrowed under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid, and/or the commitments thereunder may be voluntarily reduced or terminated, in each case, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty. As of December 31, 2022, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.
Security; Guarantees
GBT UK TopCo Limited, a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of GBT, and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, as guarantors (such guarantors, collectively with the Borrower, the “Loan Parties”), provide an unconditional guarantee, on a joint and several basis, of all obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement and under cash management agreements and swap contracts with the lenders or their affiliates (with certain limited exceptions). Subject to certain cure rights, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, at least 70% of the consolidated total assets of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries must be attributable, in the aggregate, to the Loan Parties; provided that such coverage test shall instead be calculated based on 70% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, the calculation of which differs from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA included elsewhere in this Annual Report) of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries for the four prior fiscal quarters, commencing with the first quarterly test date after January 2021 on which Consolidated EBITDA of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries exceeds $100 million. Further, the lenders have a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties. The Borrower may (but is not required to) join GBT JerseyCo and GBTG as additional guarantors under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, subject to satisfying the requirements set forth therein.
Interest and Certain Fees
Loans outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement accrue interest at a variable interest rate based on either LIBOR, adjusted SOFR or the “base rate” (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin (with a 1.00% SOFR floor for loans under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities, the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, and a 0.00% LIBOR floor for the Senior Secured Initial Term Loans). The Senior Secured Initial Term Loans have an applicable margin of 2.50% per annum for LIBOR loans and 1.50% per annum for base rate loans. For any period for which accrued interest is paid in cash, the applicable margin for loans under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities and the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility is initially 6.75% per annum for SOFR loans and 5.75% per annum for base rate loans and, commencing with the test period ending September 30, 2023, will vary with the total leverage ratio (calculated in a manner set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement), ranging from 5.25% to 6.75% per annum for SOFR loans and 4.25% to 5.75% per annum for base rate loans. Until December 16, 2023, the Borrower will have the option to pay accrued interest on loans under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities and the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility at a rate equal to (i) adjusted SOFR (with a 1.00% SOFR floor) plus 4.00% per annum with respect to the portion required to be paid in cash plus (ii) 4.00% per annum with respect to the portion paid in kind by adding such interest to the principal amount of the loans. Loans outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility have an initial applicable margin of 6.25% per annum for SOFR loans and 5.25% per annum for base rate loans and, commencing with the test period ending September 30, 2023, will vary with the total leverage ratio (calculated in a manner set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement), ranging from 4.75% to 6.25% per annum for SOFR loans and 3.75% to 5.25% per annum for base rate loans. If any amount owing under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement is not paid when due, then such overdue amount would thereafter bear interest at a rate that is 2.00% per annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable thereon. Interest on the loans outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement is payable quarterly in arrears (or, if earlier in the case of LIBOR and SOFR loans, at the end of the applicable interest period). As of December 31, 2022, the applicable interest rate in effect was 6.88% for the Senior Secured Initial Term Loans and 11.23% for loans under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities. The Borrower paid $15 million of upfront fees for the commitments of the lenders under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities. The Borrower was required to pay a fee of 3.00% per annum on the actual daily unused delayed draw commitments under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-3 Term Loan Facilities. The Borrower paid approximately $3.78 million of upfront fees for the commitments of the lenders under the Senior Secured New Tranche B-4 Term Loan Facility. The Borrower is required to pay a fee of 0.375% per annum on the average daily unused commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, payable quarterly in arrears. The Borrower is also obligated to pay other customary fees described in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement.

33



Covenants
The Senior Secured Credit Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants (see below) and limitations (subject to exceptions) on the ability of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries to: (i) incur indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) incur liens on their assets; (iii) consummate certain fundamental changes (such as acquisitions, mergers, liquidations or changes in the nature of the business); (iv) dispose of all or any part of their assets; (v) pay dividends or other distributions with respect to, or repurchase, any equity interests of any Loan Party or any equity interests of any direct or indirect parent company or subsidiary of any Loan Party; (vi) make investments, loans or advances; (vii) enter into transactions with affiliates and certain other permitted holders; (viii) modify the terms of, or prepay, any of their subordinated or junior lien indebtedness; (ix) make certain changes to a Loan Party’s entity classification for U.S. federal income tax purposes or certain intercompany transfers of a Loan Party’s assets if, as a result thereof, an entity would cease to be a Loan Party due to adverse tax consequences; (x) enter into swap contracts; and (xi) enter into certain burdensome agreements.
Certain restricted payments and debt incurrences that would otherwise be permitted under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement cannot be made during the suspension period implemented pursuant to the January 2023 amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement. Any such prohibited payment or incurrence would trigger an automatic reduction to zero of the commitments under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility for the duration of the suspension period, which would give rise to prepayment and/or cash collateral requirements in respect of then-current utilization of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, any such payment or incurrence would constitute a violation of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement if any revolving loans would be outstanding immediately thereafter.
The Senior Secured Credit Agreement also requires that an aggregate amount of Liquidity, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, equal to at least $200 million be maintained as of the end of each calendar month. Liquidity is calculated as the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries plus, under certain circumstances, the unused amount available to be drawn under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.
The Senior Secured Credit Agreement also contains an additional financial covenant applicable solely to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility that requires the first lien net leverage ratio to be less than or equal to 3.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter on which (a) the suspension period is not in effect and (b) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding loans and letters of credit under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility exceeds 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Agreement provides that such financial covenant is suspended for a limited period of time if an event that constitutes a “Travel MAC” (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) has occurred and the Loan Parties are unable to comply with such covenant as a result of such event. The first lien net leverage ratio is calculated as the ratio of (i) the aggregate principal amount of funded indebtedness and capital lease obligations of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries that are secured by liens that rank pari passu with or senior in priority to the liens securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, minus the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated balance sheet of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries, as of the relevant test date, to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Agreement, the calculation of which differs from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA included elsewhere in this Annual Report and may differ from the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA for other purposes under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement) of the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries for the four prior fiscal quarters. Such financial covenant did not apply for the year ended December 31, 2022 and will be suspended through July 1, 2024 (unless we elect to demonstrate compliance on an earlier date).
After giving effect to the Senior Secured Credit Agreement Amendment, the Loan Parties and their subsidiaries were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022.
Events of Default
The Senior Secured Credit Agreement contains default events (subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods), which could require early prepayment, termination of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement or other enforcement actions customary for facilities of this type. Defaults include, but are not limited to, the following:

● | non-payment of principal, interest or other amounts when due under the Senior Secured Credit Agreement;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

34




● | materially incorrect representations or warranties;
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | breaches of covenants;
--+-----------------------


● | cross-default to other material indebtedness of any of the Loan Parties or their subsidiaries;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one or more material monetary judgments against any of the Loan Parties or their subsidiaries remaining undischarged, unpaid or unstayed;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | certain bankruptcy or insolvency events affecting any of the Loan Parties or any of their material subsidiaries;

Sales and Marketing
Our travel management solutions are procured by business clients who choose one or more TMCs to manage their organizations’ travel program. Our Global Customer Partnerships team is focused on developing relationships with, and engaging with, new prospects. They also manage day-to-day relationships with our existing client base, including sales and marketing of our products, services and solutions to our existing clients.
In addition to supporting travelers, our travel counselors and digital self-service channels act as an extension of the salesforce for our travel suppliers, promoting and marketing content in line with our business client and supplier agreements.
Our dedicated Global Supplier Partnerships team works closely with our travel suppliers to promote our solutions to travel suppliers and negotiate proprietary content that delivers value and benefits to our clients.
Our GBT Partner Solutions business is grown by a dedicated sales team that develops relationships and negotiate partnerships with prospective TMCs and independent agents that could benefit from our platform and/or prospective service delivery partners who could become part of our TPN.
We receive marketing funds from certain travel suppliers for use in promotion, product and brand development programs, including national and/or regional marketing, advertising, public relations, social media, research and sales promotion campaigns.
Competition
The travel industry, and the business travel services industry, are highly competitive. We currently compete, and will continue to compete, with a variety of travel and travel-related companies, including other business travel management service 

35



providers, consumer travel agencies and emerging and established online travel agencies. We also compete with travel suppliers, such as airlines and hotels, some of which market their products and services directly to business travelers through B2C channels, including by offering more favorable rates, exclusive products/services and loyalty points to business travelers who purchase directly from such travel suppliers through B2C channels. We also compete against customers determining to self-manage their business travel. We compete, to a lesser extent, with credit card loyalty programs, online travel search and price comparison services, facilitators of alternative accommodations, such as short-term home or condominium rentals, and social media and e-commerce websites. In the future, we may also face increased competition including through the emergence of new competitors or business models. Some of our competitors may have access to more financial resources, greater name recognition and well-established client bases in their target client segments, differentiated business models, technology and other capabilities, or a differentiated geographic coverage, which may make it difficult for us and our Network Partners to retain or attract new clients. Nevertheless, we believe we are distinguished from our competitors by:

● | our ability to provide services tailored to the specific needs of business clients and travelers effectively and efficiently when compared to B2C-focused travel service providers; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our portfolio of solutions that target some of the most attractive segments in business travel, solutions tailored to solve the needs of these segments, our platform that delivers differentiated value and experiences to clients and travelers and our track record of consistent delivery of excellent service and value when compared to other B2B-focused travel service providers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights, domain names, proprietary technology and trade secrets, are an important component of our business, and we rely heavily upon our intellectual property and proprietary information in our content, brands, domain names and website URLs and other components that make up our services. We have acquired some of our intellectual property rights and proprietary information through acquisitions, as well as licenses and content agreements with third parties. We protect our intellectual property and proprietary information through registrations, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, in addition to international, national, state and common law intellectual property rights.
We depend on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems, including, but not limited to the following:

● | third-party reservation systems from all the major GDS providers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party and company-owned online booking portals for air, hotel, car, cruise, activities, insurance etc.;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party and company-owned technology that facilitates the marketing of supplier sponsored advertisements and promotions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | marketing platforms to attract and acquire quality leads from the internet;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party and proprietary systems for providing customer service, accepting and processing payments, detecting fraud, etc.;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | business intelligence tools to deliver insights and reporting for our business travelers;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | mobile applications to assist our travel advisors in providing just in time services for travelers such as trip or flight recovery tools and destination-related emergency monitoring and alerts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party and proprietary systems for various business processes such as ticketing, policy validation, document delivery, invoicing, commission management, operational reporting and finance; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enterprise communication and productivity software, systems and computing devices for our travel advisors.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continuously improve and upgrade our systems, infrastructure and information security. Over the next several years, we intend to continue to increase the level of investment towards information security to better protect data, communication and 

36



transactions. In addition, we plan to invest in technology to allow for the next generation of travel advisors to come onboard quickly without needing to learn complex GDS cryptic commands, while providing them qualified leads to help them build a book of business and grow.
We have also designed processes to streamline travel advisor sales and support workflow to integrate acquired companies efficiently.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 19,000 employees worldwide with a proprietary presence or operations in 31 countries. While our employees in many European, Asia Pacific and Latin American countries are legally required to be represented by works councils and/or trade unions, our employees in North America are not represented by any labor organization and are not party to any collective bargaining arrangement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relationship with our employees to be mutually respectful.
We are committed to rewarding and supporting our employees to enable us to attract and retain top talent globally. Our total compensation package includes competitive base pay (with variable pay programs to reward outstanding performance), bonus programs, long-term incentive programs, benefits programs, retirement savings options and matching contributions, paid time off for sick and vacation, and protected leave time for medical and family care, of which both medical and bonding leaves are paid.
As part of our continuous effort to cultivate a better workplace, we conduct global engagement surveys annually. These surveys focus on a variety of different areas, including engagement and alignment with our GBT behaviors. Although our workforce was primarily remote prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to a 100% remote workforce in 2020. Since that time, we have conducted a series of pulse surveys to understand and respond to the needs of our employees in real time. These pulse surveys focused on topics such as our employees’ continued effectiveness in a remote environment, continued client focus, employee health and well-being and social equity. In the most recent pulse survey performed in July 2022, we achieved a 70% participation rate. We had an overall engagement score of 77%, which is 6% higher than the global high performing benchmark of the most admired corporations as defined by our third-party engagement expert. In addition, 90% of our employees report feeling that people of all backgrounds can succeed at the Company, 8% higher than the global high performing benchmark.
We believe that the development and engagement of our employees is key to our sustainability and growth. We aim to ensure that our hiring and promotional processes are both transparent and equitable. We also provide a range of continuing education programs to our employees to promote their skill and professional development. Our employees have access to product and technology training so that they can stay up to date on product and travel booking tools, as well as leadership, management and professional skills training. We also have a global tuition reimbursement policy available to full-time and part-time employees worldwide.
The health and wellness of our employees is a primary focus. Our employees have access to voluntary wellness programs, tools and resources. In 2020, we expanded our global flexible work program, Better Balance, to make alternative work arrangements available to our employees to suit their needs. This program continues to be in effect.
A key component of our corporate culture is our commitment to creating a globally inclusive workplace. As of December 31, 2022, 67.5% of the global employee headcount was female and, in the U.S., 33.3% of our employees self-identified as part of a minority group. We seek to continuously improve diverse representation in our workforce. In 2020, we established a global Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Center of Excellence to improve colleague awareness, reduce unconscious bias in the workplace and help drive diversity, equity and inclusion across GBT. We now have seven active inclusion groups which are open to all employees.
We remain committed to ensuring that all employees can continuously grow and develop with us.
Facilities
We lease our corporate headquarters in London, United Kingdom pursuant to a lease that expires on April 1, 2025. We believe that our headquarters space is adequate for our needs and we believe that we should be able to renew our lease or secure a similar property without an adverse impact on our operations.

37



We also routinely make purchases of property and equipment to strengthen our information technology infrastructure and enabling technologies. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our ongoing needs, and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
Legal Proceedings
We are involved in litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Management believes that we do not have any pending litigation that, separately or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
Government Regulation
Travel Licenses and Regulation
We maintain travel licenses and/or registrations in the jurisdictions in which they are required. We are required to renew our licenses, typically on an annual basis, and to do so, we must satisfy the licensee renewal requirements of each jurisdiction. Failure to satisfy any of the requirements to which our licensed entities are subject could result in a variety of regulatory actions ranging from a fine, a directive requiring remedial action, suspension of a license or, ultimately, revocation of a license.
In the United States, our businesses are subject to regulation by the DOT under the U.S. Transportation Code and state agencies under state seller of travel laws and must comply with various rules and regulations governing the holding out, offering, sale and arrangement of travel products and services as a travel agency and, in the case of the DOT, air transportation as a ticket agent. Failure to comply with these rules and regulations could also result in a variety of regulatory actions, including investigations, fines or directives requiring remedial action.
Our businesses also are subject to licensing requirements imposed by airline established organizations, including agent accreditation requirements by the Airlines Reporting Corporation in the United States and, in other countries, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”). Pursuant to such accreditations, our businesses are authorized to sell and issue tickets on behalf of various airlines, subject to agent rules set by the Airlines Reporting Corporation and the IATA. The failure by our businesses to comply with such rules could result in the suspension or revocation of our authority to sell and issue tickets on behalf of one or more airlines.
As we continue to expand the reach of our services into other regions we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel advisors or tour operators in those regions, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements, mandatory bonding and travel indemnity fund contributions, industry specific value-added tax regimes and laws regulating the provision of travel packages.
Banking Regulation
Because American Express “controls” GBT for purposes of the BHC Act, GBT is subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has broad examination and enforcement power, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict our operations and acquisitions and require divestitures. Any of the foregoing could compromise our competitive position, especially because our competitors are not subject to these same regulations. For additional information, see “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Regulatory, Tax and Litigation Matters — Because we are deemed to be “controlled” by American Express under the BHC Act, we are and will be subject to supervision, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve which could adversely affect our future growth and our business, results of operations and financial condition.”
Activities
The BHC Act generally limits bank holding companies, including entities that are deemed “controlled” for BHC Act purposes, to activities that are considered to be banking activities and certain closely related activities. American Express is a bank holding company and has elected to become a financial holding company, which means that it and the entities that are deemed “controlled” for BHC Act purposes are authorized to engage in a broader range of activities. In order to remain eligible for financial 

38



holding company status, bank holding companies must meet certain eligibility requirements. If a bank holding company fails meet to these requirements, the bank holding company and any entities that are deemed “controlled” by the bank holding company for BHC Act purposes could be barred from making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on such financial holding company status, and ultimately such entities could be required to discontinue certain activities permitted for financial holding companies.
Acquisitions and Investments
We are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions and, in some limited circumstances, subject them to the prior review and approval of the Federal Reserve.
Privacy, Data Protection, Data Governance, Information and Cyber Security
Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies and a governance framework to comply with applicable privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security laws and requirements, meet evolving customer and industry expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth. Our regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security-related policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access. Regulators are also focused on data management, data governance and our third-party risk management policies and practices.
We are subject to certain privacy, data protection, data governance and information and cyber security laws in the United States and other countries in which we operate (including countries in the European Union (the “EU”), Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom), some of which are more stringent and/or expansive than the applicable laws in the United States and some of which may conflict with each other. Some countries and the EU have instituted or are considering instituting requirements that make it onerous to transfer personal data to other jurisdictions. Other countries may require in-country data processing and/or in-country storage of data. Compliance with such laws results in higher technology, administrative and other costs for us, and could require use of local technology services. Data breach and operational outage notification laws or regulatory activities to encourage such notifications and regulatory activity and laws around resiliency, business continuity and third-party risk management are also becoming more prevalent in jurisdictions outside the United States in which we operate. In Europe, the GDPR imposes legal and compliance obligations on companies that process personal data of individuals in the EU, irrespective of the geographical location of the company, with the potential for significant fines for non-compliance (up to 4 percent of total annual worldwide revenue). The GDPR includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches, in certain circumstances, to affected individuals and supervisory authorities. The UK GDPR, which became effective in January 2021, mirrors the compliance requirements and fine structure of the GDPR.
Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Compliance
We are subject to regulation, and an increasingly stringent enforcement environment, with respect to compliance with anti-money laundering (“AML”), sanctions and anti-corruption laws and regulations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs and policies and procedures for AML, sanctions and anti-corruption compliance could have material financial, legal and reputational consequences.
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The United States prohibits U.S. persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as “Specially Designated Nationals,” such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. These prohibitions are administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and are typically known as the OFAC rules. The OFAC rules prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to the prohibited individual, entity or country, require the blocking of assets in which the individual, entity or country has an interest, and prohibit transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons) to such individual, entity or country. Blocked assets (e.g., property or bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. We maintain a global 

39



sanctions program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements. Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences, including criminal penalties.
Anti-Corruption
We are subject to complex international and U.S. anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments. The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage. The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls standards. The UK Bribery Act also prohibits commercial bribery and the receipt of a bribe, and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. Failure of the Company, our subsidiaries, employees, contractors or agents to comply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and other similar laws can expose us and/or individual colleagues to investigation, prosecution and potentially severe criminal and civil penalties.
Other
We maintain operations and employees in the U.S. and worldwide. Accordingly, we are subject to a wide range of employment laws and regulations relating to compensation, benefits, healthcare, headcount reductions and various workplace issues, all of which are applicable to our employees, and in some cases, independent contractors. State labor and employment rules vary from state to state and, in some states, require us to meet much stricter standards than required in other states.
