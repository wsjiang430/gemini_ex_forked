Item 1. Business
Overview
Consumers have made mobile devices the center of their digital lives, and they have made digital conversational experiences the center of communication with friends, family and peers. LivePerson, Inc. (“LivePerson”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) is a global leader in AI-powered customer conversations. Since 1998, LivePerson has enabled billions of meaningful connections between consumers and our customers. These speech or text conversations harness human agents, bots and AI to power convenient, personalized and content-rich journeys across the entire consumer lifecycle, and across consumer platforms. AI has accelerated our capability to leverage those prior conversations to enhance the consumer experience and to improve results for our customers.
The Conversational Cloud, our enterprise-class cloud-based platform, enables businesses to have conversations with millions of consumers as personally as they would with a single consumer. The Conversational Cloud powers conversations across each of a brand’s primary digital channels, including mobile apps, mobile and desktop web browsers, SMS, social media, and third-party consumer messaging platforms. Brands can also use the Conversational Cloud to message consumers when they dial a 1-800 number instead of forcing them to navigate IVRs and wait on hold. Similarly, the Conversational Cloud can ingest traditional emails and convert them into messaging conversations, or embed messaging conversations directly into web advertisements, rather than redirect consumers to static website landing pages. Agents can manage all conversations with consumers through a single console interface, regardless of where the conversations originated.
LivePerson’s robust, cloud-based suite of rich messaging, real-time chat, AI and automation offerings features consumer and agent facing bots, intelligent routing and capacity mapping, real-time intent detection and analysis, queue prioritization, customer sentiment, analytics and reporting, content delivery, PCI compliance, co-browsing, and a sophisticated proactive targeting engine. An extensible API stack facilitates a lower cost of ownership by facilitating robust integration into back-end systems, as well as enabling developers to build their own programs and services on top of the platform. 
LivePerson’s Conversational AI platform enables what we call “the tango” of humans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating messaging with our proprietary Conversational AI, as well as third-party bots, the Conversational Cloud offers brands a comprehensive approach to scaling automations across their millions of customer conversations.
Complementing our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings are teams of technical, solutions and consulting professionals that have developed deep domain expertise in the implementation and optimization of conversational services across industries and messaging endpoints. LivePerson’s products, coupled with our domain knowledge, industry expertise and professional services, have been proven to maximize the impact of Conversational AI and deliver measurable return on investment for our customers. Certain of our customers have achieved the following advantages from our offerings:
•the ability for each agent to manage as many as 40 messaging conversations at a time, as compared to one at a time for a voice agent and two to four at a time for a good chat agent. Adding AI and bots provides even greater scale to the number of conversations managed; 
•labor efficiency gains of at least two times that of voice agents, effectively cutting labor costs by at least 50%;
•improving the overall customer experience, thereby fueling customer satisfaction score increases of up to 20 percentage points, and enhancing retention and loyalty;
•more convenient, personalized and content-rich conversations that increase sales conversion by up to 20%, increase average order value and reduce abandonment; 
•more satisfied contact center agents, thereby reducing agent churn by up to 50%;
•a valued connection with consumers via mobile devices, either through native applications, websites, text messages, or third-party messaging platforms; and
•leveraged spending that drives visitor traffic by increasing visitor conversions.

As a “cloud computing” or SaaS provider, LivePerson provides solutions on a hosted basis. This model offers significant benefits over premise-based software, including lower up-front costs, faster implementation, lower total cost of ownership, scalability, cost predictability, and simplified upgrades. Organizations that adopt a fully-hosted, multi-tenant architecture that is maintained by LivePerson eliminate the majority of the time, server infrastructure costs, and IT resources required to implement, maintain, and support traditional on-premise software.
Hundreds of the world’s biggest brands, including HSBC, Virgin Media, and Burberry use our conversational solutions to orchestrate humans and AI, at scale, and create a convenient and personalized relationship with their customers.
LivePerson’s consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects Experts who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with Users. Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and programming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics.
LivePerson was incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 1995 and the LivePerson service was introduced in November 1998. The Company completed an initial public offering in April 2000 and is currently traded on the Nasdaq and the TASE. LivePerson is headquartered in New York City. 
Market Opportunity
LivePerson’s proprietary messaging and Conversational AI enable consumers and businesses to use natural language over conversational interfaces such as voice, messaging apps, a brand’s own website and apps, and social platforms, in order to get answers to questions, make purchases and resolve customer care inquiries. 
Our view is that once a consumer has established their favorite brands as contacts in their preferred messaging app, they will be less likely to contact that brand by other means. Instead, they will simply select the contact, open up the thread with their entire history with the brand, and then renew the conversation. As a result, we anticipate that the billions of dollars previously invested by brands across these legacy channels will be increasingly allocated to experiences powered by AI platforms.
Historically, brands have predominantly promoted calling their 1-800 number or using email as the primary means of contact with consumers. We believe that moving these calls to messaging represents the largest portion of what we estimate is a $60 billion go-to-market opportunity. We estimate that nearly half of this market opportunity is tied to service, and the other half tied to sales, marketing, social and brick and mortar use cases.
LivePerson believes that AI and automation are the foundation for transforming the conversational experience, disrupting how agents operate and how brands engage with consumers. With AI at the center of the solution and by harnessing data from all primary channels, including voice, messaging, chat, and human agents, LivePerson is in a unique position to provide the best conversational experiences for consumers. Deep voice integrations with CRM, service, and IT systems allows us to deliver a unified agent experience through a single pane of glass.
We believe that consumer traffic and digital spending will increasingly shift away from websites and mobile apps to conversational engagements. We think that websites and e-commerce have not lived up to the expectations of businesses and that consumers are likewise frustrated with the navigational experience and the challenges of getting questions answered on websites. In fact, decades after the invention of the internet, e-commerce still only accounts for approximately 15% of total retail sales and, in the U.S., Amazon.com accounts for approximately 40% of this share.
We believe that LivePerson’s proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings provide a superior alternative to websites, 800 numbers and branded apps. We conclude that consumers will increasingly opt to connect with brands through their preferred messaging channels, such as Apple Business Chat, WhatsApp, SMS, Messenger, or Twitter, rather than clutter their mobile devices, waste storage, and potentially impact cell phone performance by downloading a multitude of individual apps.
Strategy
Our strategy is to continue to enhance the Conversational AI engine and related products, by leveraging our global R&D footprint and substantial library of mobile and online conversational data, with the aim of increasing agent efficiency, decreasing customer care costs, improving the customer experience and increasing customer lifetime value.
The key elements of LivePerson’s business solutions strategy include:
Increase messaging volumes by developing a broad ecosystem, expanding customer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation. Our strategy is to drive higher messaging volumes by going both wide across messaging endpoints, deep across consumer use cases, and focusing on AI and automation as the means to deliver powerful scale. 
In order to drive broad messaging adoption, it is imperative that the Conversational Cloud integrates to all of the messaging apps that consumers prefer to use for communication and addresses all key use cases. For example, if a consumer is an avid WhatsApp user, and a brand only offers SMS as a messaging option, that consumer may be reluctant to try messaging the brand. Therefore, a key strategy of ours has been to build one of the industry’s broadest ecosystems of messaging endpoints and use cases. In June 2016, we launched with In-App messaging. In 2017, we introduced Facebook Messenger, SMS, Web messaging and IVR deflection integrations. In 2018, we added Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, Google Ad Lingo and Twitter. In 2019, we added email, allowing brands to manage emails through the same console they use for messaging, and to convert legacy emails into messaging conversations. We also added social monitoring and conversational tools for Twitter and Facebook, and introduced proactive messaging, allowing brands to transform traditional one-way notifications such as flight cancellations or phone plan overage alerts into two-way conversations. Finally, we connected to Facebook and WhatsApp digital advertisements, enabling consumers to initiate messaging conversations for marketing and customer care directly within the advertisement. In 2020, we added Instagram and Google’s Business Messages, allowing brands to bring customer-initiated conversations into the Conversational Cloud directly from Instagram, Google Search, and Google Maps. 
In 2021, we acquired Callinize, Inc. (dba Tenfold) (“Tenfold”), which allows our brands to bring the LivePerson Conversational Cloud into other applications, starting with Salesforce and expanding into other leading CRM and Helpdesk platforms. The ability to power conversational experiences beyond our own workspace opens up further messaging volumes and workflows for LivePerson to participate in. We made good progress on these integrations in 2022.
LivePerson makes the management of all these disparate channels seamless to the brand. AI-based intelligent routing, queuing and prioritization software orchestrates these conversations at scale, regardless of which messaging endpoint they originated from, so that human and bot agents can engage with all customers through just one console.
Our Conversational AI leadership and the increase in adoption have influenced LivePerson’s enterprise and mid-market revenue retention rate, (the trailing-twelve-month change in total revenue from existing customers after upsells, downsells and attrition) which was within our target range of 105% to 115% for 2022. The benefit can also be seen in LivePerson’s ARPU for our enterprise and mid-market customers, which increased approximately 11% in 2022 to $680,000 from approximately $610,000 in 2021. We believe these ARPU show that LivePerson’s strategy to drive messaging adoption has successfully influenced our revenue growth by taking share from legacy communication channels.
Attract the industry’s best AI, machine learning and conversational talent. We believe that AI and machine learning are critical to successfully scaling and exploiting our data advantage. LivePerson also expanded its development talent base in Germany, and added key development talent through the acquisitions of BotCentral in Mountain View, California; Tenfold in Austin, Texas; e-bot7 GmbH (“e-bot7”) in Munich, Germany; VoiceBase, Inc. (“VoiceBase”) in San Francisco, California; and WildHealth, Inc. (“WildHealth”) in Lexington, Kentucky.
Strengthen our position in both existing and new industries. We plan to continue to develop our market position by increasing our customer base, and expanding within our installed base. We plan to continue to focus primarily on key target markets: consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology and automotive within both our enterprise and mid-market sectors, as well as the SMB sector. 
Leverage our open architecture to integrate with other systems and support partners and developers. In addition to developing our own applications, we continue to cultivate a partner eco-system capable of offering additional applications and services to our customers. We integrate into third-party messaging endpoints including SMS, Facebook Messenger, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger, Line, WhatsApp, Alexa, Google Home, WeChat, Google Ad Lingo, Google Search, Google Maps, Instagram and Twitter, multiple IVR vendors, and dozens of branded apps. 
We have opened up access to our platform and our products with APIs and software development kits that enable customers and third parties to develop on top of our platform. Customers and partners can utilize these APIs to build our capabilities into their own applications and to enhance our applications with their services. In 2019, we launched LivePerson Functions, a serverless FaaS integration which enables brands to develop custom behaviors within LivePerson’s conversational platform to easily and rapidly tailor conversation flows to their specific needs. In 2022, we launched our partnership with Celonis to embed VoiceBase analytics and Celonis conversation mining into an application capable of analyzing omni-channel conversational data to enable operational improvements and automate the customer journey.
Expand sales partnerships to broaden our presence and accelerate sales cycles. We are focused on broadening our market reach and accelerating sales cycles by partnering with systems integrators, technology providers, business process outsourcers, value added resellers and other sales partners. We formalized a relationship with IBM Global Business Services in 2017 and Accenture in 2018. In 2019, we announced strategic partnerships with TTEC, a leading BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) company focused on customer experience, and DMI, a digital transformation company, to redefine the customer experience with digital engagement, messaging, and AI-driven automation. In 2020, a digital services and consulting company joined LivePerson’s network with a first-of-its-kind 360 degree partnership focusing not only on capturing the global rising demand for conversational commerce and building a personalized experience for customers, but also driving the transformation for internal corporate messaging and the employee experience through Conversational AI. In 2021, we announced strategic integration partnerships with Google Cloud, Adobe and Medallia to help brands make contact center agents more efficient and effective, and empower and enrich the management of customer and employee experience through the power of AI. Our network also expanded with the Tech Mahindra partnership to help brands deliver personalized conversational experiences to consumers at scale. In 2022, we partnered with Afiniti and Celonis to help brands improve customer engagement and analytics, deepened our partnership with Cisco to strengthen our CRM capabilities, and began a strategic co-selling partnership with CBA to drive sales in the Asia-Pacific region.
Evaluate strategic alliances and acquisitions when appropriate. In July 2021, we acquired German conversational AI company e-bot7, which propels our self-service capabilities and continued growth across Europe. In October 2021, we acquired VoiceBase, a leader in real-time speech recognition and conversational analytics; and Tenfold, an advanced customer engagement platform for integrating communication systems with leading CRM and support services. In February 2022, we acquired WildHealth, which leverages advanced machine learning to combine DNA analysis, biometrics, microbiome testing and phenotypic data to provide people with a blueprint for truly optimized health and a maximized health span. Once fully integrated, we expect these acquisitions to allow LivePerson to deliver our AI and automation capabilities, insights, and integration as a single integrated product offering across channels including voice and messaging.
Products and Services
Business solutions offerings
The Conversational Cloud. The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson’s enterprise-class, cloud-based platform, enables businesses and consumers to connect through conversational interfaces, such as in-app and mobile messaging, while leveraging bots and AI to increase efficiency. The platform, which is marketed primarily to managers of digital and customer care, as well as e-commerce, marketing, and contact center executives, combines sophisticated mobile and online engagement technology with robust business intelligence and big data to produce compelling, measurable results by intelligently engaging consumers based on a real-time understanding of consumer needs. Rich, contextually aware targeting, actionable insights and personalized experiences, empower businesses to get the most out of their existing online, mobile and social platforms. Potential benefits of the Conversational Cloud include increased agent efficiency, decreased customer care costs, improved customer experiences, higher conversion rates and increased customer lifetime value.
The Conversational Cloud enables the combination of real time on-site data and off-site behavioral data, with a broad set of historical and operational data. Proprietary analytics utilize this data to target end users with compelling engagement options at any step in the conversion funnel and throughout the customer lifecycle. The platform enables customers to maximize online revenue opportunities, improve conversion rates and reduce shopping cart abandonment by proactively engaging the right visitor, using the right channel, at the right time. Our solution identifies segments of website visitors who demonstrate the highest propensity to convert, and engages them in real-time with relevant content and offers, helping to generate incremental sales. The platform also reduces costs in the contact center relative to voice, by identifying consumers who may be struggling with their self-serve experience, and proactively connecting them to a live consumer care specialist via messaging, who can manage several conversations at once. This comprehensive solution blends a proven value-based 
methodology with an active rules-based engagement engine and deep domain expertise to increase first contact resolution, improve consumer satisfaction, and reduce attrition rates.
LivePerson’s Conversational AI. LivePerson’s Conversational AI, announced in December 2018, operates as the brains behind new LivePerson AI-based products, and was developed using our conversational data set of millions of brand-to-consumer interactions. LivePerson’s Conversational AI was custom designed for the Conversational Space, enabling what we call “the tango” of humans, AI and bots, whereby human agents act as bot managers, overseeing AI-powered conversations and seamlessly stepping into the flow when a personal touch is needed. Through the Conversational Cloud, agents become ultra-efficient, leveraging the AI engine to serve up relevant content, define next-best actions and take over repetitive transactional work so that the agent can focus on relationship building. By seamlessly integrating the Conversational Cloud with our proprietary AI, as well as third-party bots, the platform provides businesses with a comprehensive view of all AI-based and human-based conversations from a single console. Some of the first products developed on LivePerson’s Conversational AI engine include:
•Conversation Builder, which non-technical staff such as contact center agents use to design high-quality automated conversations. The conversations are not built from scratch. Conversation Builder creates the initial versions by mining a brand’s existing conversation transcripts. Prebuilt industry templates are also available, providing the dialogue and integrations necessary for common use cases such as billing.
•Conversation Manager, a console that suggests automated responses and next best actions to contact center agents, who edit and select from them. Edits and selections dynamically improve the responses and next best actions. When the content reaches a brand-set accuracy threshold, it can be offered to consumers without human intervention. Conversation Manager also includes sentiment monitoring to alert contact center agents to conversations that require their attention. Designed for use in large contact centers, Conversation Manager sends these requests to agents who have the capacity and appropriate skills to respond. A major retail brand that adopted this approach in its sales operation increased agent productivity up to 220% within 12 weeks of launch.
•Conversation Analytics, dashboards and reporting which take the true voice of the customer - their direct discussions with a brand, spoken in their natural language - and turn it into actionable sales and service intelligence. A major wireless provider using early versions of Conversation Analytics reported the product identifies the root cause of service issues faster than monitoring software, enabling the provider to accelerate the fix and reduce inbound customer inquiries. A leading hospitality firm used Conversation Analytics to identify and add new, top-selling items to its menu selection.
•Intent Manager, a real-time intent recognition and classification engine that analyzes consumer intentions at every turn of the conversation. Intent Manager is powered by LivePerson’s proprietary natural language understanding capabilities and machine learning algorithms, which are grounded in over 20+ years of conversational data and more than one billion messaging transcripts across a variety of industries. Intent Manager is currently being used by top brands to gain real-time insights and take action to improve customer service, marketing, and sales automation.
•Performance Optimizer, a measurement tool to help brands to measure and manage the health of their conversational operations in a single self-service dashboard. Performance Optimizer measures critical metrics for conversational experiences and uses AI to automatically assess performance, provide actionable insights, and deliver executive reporting.
Professional Services
The mission of our Professional Services team is to help customers optimize the performance of our products in order to drive incremental value through their mobile and online sales and/or service channel(s). This talented group utilizes their deep domain expertise and years of hands-on experience to provide customers with detailed analyses and measurements of their LivePerson deployment that drive strategies and decisions on how to optimize mobile and online messaging, real-time chat, and bot and AI integration. Deliverables of the team include scorecards that measure and chart performance trends, analyses and recommendations for conversational design, web design and process improvement, transcript reviews to discover both voice of the consumer insight and agent improvement opportunities, custom training of call center agents and management, and ongoing management of messaging programs to ensure alignment with current business practices and objectives. The team’s value-added methodology and approach to guiding customers towards messaging channels and human/bot agent optimization is an important component of the LivePerson offering, and gives our customers a competitive advantage in the digital world. 
WildHealth
    In the first quarter of 2022, we acquired WildHealth, which leverages advanced machine learning to combine DNA analysis, biometrics, microbiome testing and phenotypic data to provide people with a blueprint for truly optimized health and a maximized health span. The acquisition is part of the Company’s strategy to pursue the adoption of its technology-driven offerings in the healthcare space by combining a rich healthcare data platform with Conversational AI to enable B2B healthcare brands to scale and personalize patient engagement. 
e-Bot7
In the third quarter of 2021, we acquired German conversational AI company e-bot7. We expect the acquisition to empower brands of all sizes to quickly launch AI-powered messaging experiences — as well as its continued growth in Europe. We believe that combining e-bot7’s simple, easy-to-use technology with LivePerson’s world-class NLU, global organization, and vast customer base will accelerate the speed at which brands can deploy and train AI-powered conversations.
Tenfold
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired Tenfold, a customer experience integration platform that enables enterprises to modernize customer experience tools without having to replace legacy systems. Tenfold helps transform voice networks and contact center providers without impacting day-to-day operations. Its customers include brands such as Wayfair, TransAmerica, and Sixt. We intend to maintain Tenfold’s business operations while integrating and leveraging Tenfold’s technology platform with our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings. With Tenfold, LivePerson messaging becomes available to agents anywhere — embedded in a CRM, on the agent’s desktop, or in the brand’s own integrated systems. Once fully integrated, as a voice platform-agnostic, blended system, we expect the offering also to provide enhanced flexibility for brands to work with any voice vendor and complement LivePerson messaging without impacting agent experience and productivity.
VoiceBase
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired VoiceBase, a voice analytics platform for the enterprise, built on advanced speech recognition technology, that transforms voice and messaging conversations into easily interpreted data and actionable insights. It works with leading brands such as GrubHub, Twilio, Delta Dental, UserTesting, and Slice, and has out-of-the-box integrations with leading telephony and contact-center systems including RingCentral, Genesys, NICE CXone, Avaya, Twilio, and now LivePerson. We intend to maintain VoiceBase’s business operations while integrating and leveraging VoiceBase’s technology with our proprietary messaging and Conversational AI offerings. Once fully integrated, we anticipate that VoiceBase’s capabilities with LivePerson’s Conversational AI will give brands enhanced visibility into customer intents, sentiments, frustrations, and successes from 100% of conversations across messaging and voice, as well as third-party voice, telephony, or contact center systems. These insights make it easier to improve customer experience, uncover sales opportunities and increase revenue, and understand agent productivity and utilization.
Consumer services offering
Our consumer services offering is an online marketplace that connects Experts who provide information and knowledge for a fee via mobile and online messaging with Users. Users seek assistance and advice in various categories including personal counseling and coaching, computers and programming, education and tutoring, spirituality and religion, and other topics. The business comprising our consumer services offering has been classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2022. See Note 20 – Assets Held for Sale in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Customers
More than 18,000 customers have deployed our business solutions, including Fortune 500 companies, dedicated internet businesses, a broad range of online merchants, as well as numerous SMBs, automotive dealers, universities, libraries, government agencies and not-for-profit organizations. Our solutions benefit organizations of all sizes conducting business or communicating with consumers through mobile and online messaging and chat. We plan to continue to focus on key target markets: consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology, healthcare, and automotive, within the U.S. and Canada, Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.
No single customer accounted for or exceeded 10% of our total revenue for 2022, 2021, or 2020.
Sales and Marketing

Sales. Our mobile and online messaging solutions are targeted at business executives whose primary responsibility is optimization of customer care, sales and marketing, or optimizing a consumer’s journey across the brand’s digital properties. Our solutions enable organizations to provide effective customer service, sales and marketing by deflecting costly phone calls and emails to the more cost efficient mobile and online messaging channel. We focus on the value that our solutions deliver in the form of increased agent efficiency, reduced contact center costs, increased customer satisfaction, improved customer lifetime value, maximized digital consumer acquisition, and optimized website and mobile business outcomes. 
Within the business solutions segment we have aligned our field organization to address the different sales strategies of our target markets:
Enterprise and large mid-market. We target enterprises which have thousands of agents in their contact centers and collectively connect with billions of consumers each year. We leverage thought leadership and related events to showcase our strength in messaging and AI, and highlight existing reference customers who share their successes on our platform and how they achieved positive ROIs. Increasingly, we are working with large third-party system integrators, technology providers and business process outsourcers to supplement our direct sales effort.
Small business and small mid-market. We target small business and small mid-market customers with a mix of direct, online self-service, and third-party partner channels. Our customer acquisition strategy centers on leveraging customer word-of-mouth, our leading brand name, online marketing and partnerships. We also leverage marketing programs and partner resources to promote increased usage and product adoption within these customers.
Indirect Sales. Resources within our organization are focused on developing partnerships to generate revenues via referral partnerships and indirect sales through channel partners. By maximizing market coverage via partners who provide lead referrals and complementary products and services, we believe this channel supports revenue opportunities without incurring the costs associated with traditional direct sales. Our acquisition of Tenfold has accelerated our ability to integrate with legacy customer systems as well as competing or complementary customer service solutions.
Customer Support. Our Professional Services group provides deployment support and ongoing business consulting to enterprise and mid-market customers and maintains involvement throughout the engagement lifecycle. All LivePerson customers have access to 24/7 help desk services through messaging, chat, and technical support ticketing.

Marketing. We have a global team, spread across key geographies that is focused on marketing our brand, products and services to executives responsible for the digital channel, the consumer experience, marketing, sales, IT, and consumer service operations of their organization.
Our main focus is on the consumer/retail, telecommunications, financial services, travel/hospitality, technology, healthcare, and automotive industries. 
Our marketing strategy encompasses a strategic communications approach that integrates public relations, social media, and analyst/influencer relations. Communications seek to highlight key customer success stories, and promote executive thought leadership via contributed content, speaking opportunities and press interviews, to raise LivePerson’s profile and reinforce our position as an industry leader.
Competition
The markets for AI-enhanced customer interaction, mobile and online business messaging, and digital engagement technology are intensely competitive, rapidly changing and characterized by aggressive marketing, pricing pressure, evolving industry standards, rapid technology developments, and frequent new product introductions.
We believe that most contact center technology vendors incorrectly view messaging as simply a feature or channel. They are content with building integrations to a messaging endpoint and offering messaging as just another product in their suite. LivePerson believes that messaging and AI are the foundation for conversational experiences, which transform how agents operate and how brands engage with consumers across service, sales, marketing, and brick and mortar. Brands must adapt their contact centers to an asynchronous messaging environment and leverage a combination of human agents, bots and AI to achieve scale and efficiencies. 
We believe that our differentiated approach to the Conversational Space, combined with our unique technology and expertise, has established the Company as a market leader, with an ability to deliver superior returns on investment:
•The Conversational Cloud, LivePerson’s enterprise-class, automation-first, cloud-based platform, was designed for AI-assisted and human-powered messaging in mobile and online channels. The platform offers best-in-class security and scalability, offers the broadest ecosystem of messaging endpoints, is designed for ease of use, and features an AI engine custom built for the Conversational Space, intent recognition, robust real-time reporting, role-based real-time analytics, predictive intelligence, and innovations in customer satisfaction and connection measurement. Additionally, the Conversational Cloud is an open platform with pre-built, enterprise-grade integrations into back-end systems as well as the ability to work across NLU providers. 
•The platform has expanded to power conversations across a broad spectrum of channels and use cases, from traditional sales and customer service, to marketing, social, email, advertising and brick and mortar. 
•The Company believes it has a significant advantage in the form of a data moat built on hundreds of millions of conversations across industries, geographies and use cases that is feeding the machine learning engines that power intent understanding. 
•LivePerson has deep domain expertise across verticals and messaging endpoints, a global footprint, referenceable enterprise brands and a team of technical, solutions and consulting professionals to assist customers along their transformational journeys. We are positioned as an authority in the Conversational Space.
We believe this focus on technological innovation, expertise and enterprise-class capabilities is positioning LivePerson as a leader in the Conversational Space. 
We have current and potential competition from providers of messaging and digital engagement solutions that enable companies to engage and connect with their consumer customers, as well as technology providers that offer customer relationship management and contact center solutions. We have current and potential competitors in many different industries, including:
•technology or service providers offering or powering competing digital engagement, contact center, communications, or customer relationship management solutions such as eGain, Genesys, Nuance, Oracle, Salesforce.com, and Twilio;
•service providers that offer basic messaging products or services with limited functionality free of charge or at significantly reduced entry level prices;
•social media, social listening, messaging, artificial intelligence, bots, e-commerce, and/or data and data analytics companies, such as Facebook, Google, and WeChat, which may leverage their existing or future capabilities and consumer relationships to offer competing business-to-business solutions; 
•customers that develop and manage their messaging solutions in-house; and
•large players in the AI space, such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft and OpenAI

Technology
Four key technological features distinguish the LivePerson services:
•LivePerson’s powerful Conversational AI is enhanced by over 20 years of proprietary, verbatim conversation data that the company has accumulated helping thousands of clients, including the world’s largest brands, message with consumers at scale. Unlike other AIs, which are applied to wide-ranging and unrelated use cases, LivePerson’s AI has been built specifically to power conversations between brands and consumers, giving it the edge in understanding consumer intents and the resolutions that best satisfy them.
•We support our customers through a secure, scalable server infrastructure. Currently, in North America, our primary servers are hosted in a fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server center located in the Mid-Atlantic United States, and are supported by a top-tier backup server facility located in the Western United States. In Europe, our primary servers are hosted in a fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server center located in the United Kingdom and are supported by a top-tier backup server facility located in The Netherlands. In the Asia Pacific region, our primary and backup servers are hosted in fully-secured, top-tier, third-party server centers located in Australia. Nearly all of our larger customers outside of the United States are hosted within our U.K.- and Australia-based facilities. By managing our servers directly, we maintain greater flexibility and control over the production environment allowing us to be responsive to customer needs and to continue to provide a superior level of service. Utilizing advanced network infrastructure and protocols, our network, hardware and software are designed to accommodate our customers’ demand for secure, high-quality 24/7 service, including during peak times such as the holiday shopping season. Beginning in 2020, we began projects to migrate some or all of our infrastructure to the public cloud.
•As a hosted service, we are able to add additional capacity and new features quickly and efficiently. This has enabled us to provide these benefits simultaneously to our entire customer base. In addition, it allows us to maintain a relatively short development and implementation cycle.
•As a SaaS provider, we focus on the development of tightly integrated software design and network architecture. We dedicate significant resources to designing our software and network architecture based on the fundamental principles of security, reliability and scalability.
Network Architecture and Security. Our network is scalable; we do not need to add new hardware or network capacity for each new LivePerson customer. Our backup server infrastructure housed at separate locations provides our primary hosting facilities with effective disaster recovery capability. We comply with security standards such as SOC2 (System and Organization Controls) and PCI. For increased security, through a multi-layered approach, we use advanced firewall architecture and industry-leading encryption standards and employ third-party experts to further validate our systems’ security. We also enable our customers to further encrypt their sensitive data using more advanced encryption algorithms.
Government Regulation
We and our customers are subject to a number of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, including laws related to conducting business on the internet and on mobile devices, such as laws regarding data privacy, data protection, information security, cybersecurity, restrictions, or technological requirements regarding the collection, use, storage, protection, disposal transfer, or other processing of consumer data, content, consumer protection, internet (or net) neutrality, advertising, electronic contracts, taxation, provision of online payment services (including credit card processing), and intellectual property rights, which are continuously evolving and developing.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
We own a portfolio of patents and patent applications in the United States and internationally and regularly file patent applications to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. As of December 31, 2022, we have 207 patents issued in the U.S. and abroad, and 241 patents pending. We had 36 patents awarded in the U.S. during 2022, and added 25 global patents. Our patents cover Conversational AI and insights, messaging across various consumer platforms, behavioral analytics and personalization, and agent effectiveness and call center operations.
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark and other common law protections in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality requirements and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property.
Human Capital Management
As a leading provider of conversational solutions, we are at the forefront of a consumer-led shift to Conversational AI, and our Conversational Cloud is setting the industry standard for this future. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,301 full-time employees worldwide, located in more than 13 countries. Of these, 731 were located in the Americas, 454 in EMEA, and 116 in APAC. Although we have statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not covered by collective bargaining arrangements. We believe we have good relations with our employees. For 2022, our key human capital management efforts focused on the following: 
Talent Acquisition and Development. We place a high priority on attracting, recruiting, developing and retaining diverse global talent. As a company, we are focused on benefits and programs that support our employees across the entire employee lifecycle, from recruitment and onboarding, to well-being, learning and development. Our recruiting processes are designed to ensure that we bring on employees who are aligned to our values and culture, and we follow a comprehensive process in order to solicit multiple perspectives and eliminate bias. 
In 2020, we launched a four-week seminar-style cohort program to ensure LivePerson employees understand the foundation of AI and how AI is transforming industries and society.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. DEI is core to our global strategy. We believe that diverse and inclusive teams foster innovation, creativity and productivity. We have invested resources in this area for some time, and intend to continue to enhance and improve our efforts. In 2021, we hired a dedicated leader to focus on our global diversity recruiting practices. We also began working with two diversity recruiting platforms, intentionally diversified our interview panels, and recalibrated our job description templates to focus more heavily on inclusivity. We also invested in a series of recruiting events in the U.S. and EMEA to help us connect underrepresented talent to open positions.
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that celebrates different perspectives, cultures, and experiences. We regularly measure the representation of women and minority groups in the Company, including in leadership and technical positions, and will continue our ongoing efforts to increase hiring of employees from these groups. We are committed to equal pay for equal work. As part of that commitment, we run a pay equity analysis when we conduct our annual compensation assessments and when we grant equity.
