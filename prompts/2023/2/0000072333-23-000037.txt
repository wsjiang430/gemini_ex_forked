DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
The Company was founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Washington under the guiding principle that success would come by offering customers the very best service, selection, quality and value. We aspire to be the best fashion retailer in a digitally connected world by leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners and our interconnected business model. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise for women, men, young adults and children, with a focus on apparel, shoes, beauty, accessories and home goods. No matter how customers choose to shop, we are committed to delivering superior service, products and experiences — including alterations, order pickup, dining and styling — to make shopping fun, personalized and convenient. We have one reportable segment, which aggregates our two operating segments, Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack.
Nordstrom is a leading destination for a breadth of products across brands, styles and prices complemented by unmatched services and experiences. As of January 28, 2023, Nordstrom includes the following digital and physical properties:
•Nordstrom.com website and mobile application
•Nordstrom.ca website
•94 Nordstrom stores in the U.S.
•six Nordstrom stores and seven Nordstrom Rack stores in Canada
•seven Nordstrom Locals
•one ASOS | Nordstrom store
Nordstrom Rack is a premier off-price destination with an industry-leading off-price digital presence, offering great brands at great prices. As of January 28, 2023, Nordstrom Rack includes the following digital and physical properties:
•NordstromRack.com website and mobile application
•241 Nordstrom Rack stores in the U.S.
•two Last Chance clearance stores
On March 2, 2023, Nordstrom Canada commenced a wind-down of its business operations. See Note 15: Subsequent Events in Item 8 for more information.
Nordstrom Rack purchases merchandise primarily from the same vendors carried at Nordstrom and also serves as an outlet for clearance merchandise from the Nordstrom banner. We continue to expand our offerings of the most coveted brands we carry, as well as source from new vendors, to ensure we have the selection our customers want. Currently, NordstromRack.com offers both a selection of Nordstrom Rack merchandise and limited-time flash sale events on fashion and lifestyle brands, which formerly existed on HauteLook.com prior to the first quarter of 2021 when it was consolidated into NordstromRack.com.
As a business, one of our key advantages lies in our ability to leverage an integrated network of physical and digital assets across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners. This creates flexibility and convenience for our customers, no matter how they choose to shop — online, through our apps or in stores. This omni-channel platform is our differentiator, providing customers with more product available for next day pickup, the ability to pick up or return orders to any store location regardless of purchase origin and our suite of personalized services. We have also found the average customer who shops across both banners, in stores and online, spends over twelve times more than a customer utilizing a single channel and banner.
Our Closer to You strategy leverages a strong store fleet and links our omni-channel capabilities at the local market level, positioning us physically closer to the customer and allowing us to drive customer engagement through better service and greater access to product. There are two elements to this strategy. First, we aim to provide customers a greater selection of merchandise available for next-day pickup or delivery without increasing inventory levels. Second, we are increasing engagement with customers by offering express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations at additional convenient locations. In 2022, we continued to scale our market strategy by expanding next-day order pickup capabilities to over 60 additional Rack stores in our top 20 markets.
We also receive credit card revenue through our program agreement with TD, whereby TD is the exclusive issuer of our consumer credit cards and we perform account servicing functions. Credit card revenues, net include our portion of the ongoing credit card revenue, net of credit losses, pursuant to our program agreement with TD. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we amended our program agreement with TD. The original agreement was scheduled to expire in April 2024 and the amendment extends the term through September 2026.

Products
In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality domestic and foreign suppliers. Additionally, we utilize unowned inventory models beyond traditional wholesale arrangements that provide a broader assortment in new and existing categories. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise.
Nordstrom Rack invests in pack and hold inventory, which involves the strategic purchase of merchandise from some of our top brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons or to minimize inventory gaps from supply chain disruptions, allowing us to buy larger quantities of relevant items when available, then hold a portion of it to deploy in periods with high demand, tight supply or system constraints. This inventory is typically held for six months on average. 
Return Policy
We have a fair and reasonable approach to returns, handling them on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate objective of making our customers happy. Almost all merchandise can be returned by mail or at any store location. We have no formal policy on how long we accept returns for purchases made at Nordstrom stores and Nordstrom.com. Our goal is to take care of our customers, which includes making returns and exchanges easy, whether in stores or online, where we offer free shipping on purchases and returns. We generally accept returns of apparel, footwear, accessories and home products with the original price tag and sales receipt up to 30 days from the date of purchase at Nordstrom Rack stores and up to 40 days from the date of order at NordstromRack.com.
Loyalty Program
The Nordy Club is our customer loyalty program that incorporates a traditional point and benefit system, while providing customers exclusive access to products and events, enhanced services, personalized experiences and more convenient ways to shop. Customers accumulate points based on their level of spending and type of participation. Upon reaching certain point thresholds, customers receive Nordstrom Notes, which can be redeemed for goods or services across Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack. The Nordy Club benefits vary based on the level of customer spend, and include bonus points days and shopping and fashion events.
We offer customers access to a variety of payment products and services, including a selection of Nordstrom-branded Visa® credit cards in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a Nordstrom-branded private label credit card for Nordstrom purchases. When customers use a Nordstrom-branded credit or debit card, they also participate in The Nordy Club and receive additional benefits, which can vary depending on the level of spend, including early access to the Anniversary Sale, enhanced alteration and stylist benefits and incremental accumulation of points toward Nordstrom Notes. 
Supply Chain Network
Our Supply Chain Network consists of: 
•three fulfillment centers that primarily process and ship orders to our customers
•six distribution centers that primarily process and ship merchandise to our stores and other facilities
•one omni-channel center that both fulfills customer orders and ships merchandise to our stores
We are continually expanding and enhancing our Supply Chain Network facilities and inventory management systems to support our omni-channel capabilities and provide greater access to merchandise selection and faster delivery. We select locations and customize inventory allocations to enable merchandise to flow more efficiently and quickly to our customers. Nordstrom online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom stores, distribution centers or omni-channel centers. Nordstrom in-store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store’s inventory, but when inventory is unavailable at that store, it may also be shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers, distribution centers, omni-channel centers or from other Nordstrom stores. Nordstrom Rack online purchases are shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers and distribution centers. Both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack selectively use vendor dropship to supplement online offerings, which are then shipped directly from the vendor to the end customer.
Our first large-scale omni-channel center in Riverside, California, which supports our Nordstrom customers in the West Coast region, opened in 2020. Nordstrom Rack inventory and fulfillment will be added to this facility in the future. Our smaller Local omni-channel Hub in Torrance, California ceased operations in the third quarter of 2022 as we scaled our Riverside location to support demand in that region.
EMPLOYEES
We believe that creating a best-in-class customer experience begins with creating an environment that celebrates and supports all our employees. As we strive to attract and retain the best talent in the industry, we are committed to cultivating a workplace culture where our employees feel included, supported and confident bringing their full selves to work.
As of January 28, 2023, we employed approximately 60,000 employees, which are comprised of approximately 80% hourly employees and 20% salaried employees. Approximately 75% of employees support our stores and approximately 12% support our Supply Chain Network. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, the number of temporary employees may vary and peak during our Anniversary Sale and holiday seasons. Currently, our employees have not chosen to be represented by a union.

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging 
Our commitment to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment is key to our mission of helping our customers feel good and look their best. We believe in equity throughout the retail industry and aim to use our resources, influence and platform to foster greater representation of diversity from all our communities. Over the past several years, we’ve amplified our efforts in this area and set specific ambitions to achieve by the end of 2025, which include: 
•Delivering $500 million in retail sales from brands owned by, operated by or designed by Black and/or Latinx individuals
•Aiming to increase representation of Black and Latinx individuals in people-manager roles by at least 50% on average
•Leveraging our internship program and other initiatives to help us reach qualified candidates early in their careers, with an ambition on average of at least 50% of participants in these programs coming from underrepresented populations
To lead and drive this work, we have operationalized diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging through consistent reviews with Erik B. Nordstrom, our Chief Executive Officer, and Farrell B. Redwine, our Chief Human Resources Officer. In addition, our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging team serves as a center of excellence within the human resources organization and collaborates with leaders across the business to develop and embed diverse, equitable and inclusive strategies.
As part of these ongoing efforts, we have several internal initiatives underway to facilitate a sense of belonging and connection among our teams. One way we do this is through our employee-led, Company-sponsored Employee Resource Groups, which represent a variety of seen and unseen identities. In 2022, eight groups served and were led by our employees, providing company-wide programming to advance understanding and celebrate voices from across our organization.
In 2022, we expanded and strengthened our talent pipelines in collaboration with the OneTen Coalition and in partnership with Morehouse College, where we supported the launch of a new product management track. Starting in the spring 2023 semester, Nordstrom leaders and technologists will teach and mentor students enrolled in the program. 
Progress toward our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging ambitions is tracked and reviewed regularly by our executive team and Board of Directors.
Employee Safety and Well-being 
The health and safety of our customers, employees and communities is a responsibility we take very seriously. We continue to offer a variety of mental, emotional and physical wellness resources to support our employees, including digital mental health support and free counseling services through our Employee Assistance Programs. 
We seek to listen to and learn from employees across our organization by cultivating an open-door policy, conducting regular listening sessions and utilizing our annual Voice of the Employee survey. We regularly review survey results against industry benchmarks to hold ourselves accountable as we continue to improve and evolve our workplace environment.
We are committed to creating a culture where employees feel as if they can bring their whole selves to work and achieve their career goals through ongoing growth and development opportunities and fair and transparent performance management and promotion processes.
Total Rewards
To support our goals to retain and attract talented employees, we review our benefits and compensation approach annually. 
•Benefits: We offer a range of benefits to all employees upon meeting eligibility requirements, including health care, wellness programs, financial and retirement plans and time away. In addition, we have increased our focus on well-being by activating a multi-year strategy to bring our people new resources and tools to support total well-being, including mental health support.
•Compensation: We’re committed to providing our employees with a great place to grow meaningful careers. We regularly review our pay in the markets in which we operate to ensure we are competitive, and we make updates accordingly throughout the year.
To ensure we are offering a rewards package that aligns with the wants and needs of our employees, we routinely ask employees for their feedback in surveys throughout the year. We use the feedback to improve the overall experience of our employees.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We believe we have a responsibility to support the communities where we operate. Our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy set in 2020 includes five-year goals focused on environmental sustainability, human rights and corporate philanthropy. In 2022, we made meaningful progress in these areas. Specific highlights include: 
•Environmental Sustainability: We expanded our BEAUTYCYCLE program to Nordstrom Rack stores. This program allows us to accept beauty packaging waste materials that typically can’t be placed in curbside recycling bins. Through BEAUTYCYCLE, we took back more than 25 tons of beauty packaging in 2022, compared with five tons in 2021. We also began replacing our plastic Nordstrom Rack shopping bags with paper bags in support of our goal to reduce single-use plastic in our value chain by 50%.
•Human Rights: We are committed to creating safe and fair workplaces for the people who make our products. Our human rights due diligence program is based on international standards, and the foundation of our human rights program is designed around third-party impact assessments and supported by our Partner Code of Conduct and relevant policies and programs, all of which were strengthened during the year and are assessed and improved cyclically. As a part of our human rights due diligence, we audit factories that make Nordstrom Made products for compliance with our Partner Code of Conduct and implement corrective action plans where necessary.
•Women’s Rights: We hit a milestone: almost 50% of Nordstrom Made products were produced in factories that offer women’s empowerment training, bringing us closer to our goal of producing 90% of Nordstrom Made products in factories that invest in women’s empowerment by 2025.
•Charitable Giving: We donated over $12 million to over 270 organizations located in the communities where we do business. Our employees gave to over 2,900 nonprofits, which we supported with 100% matching. Together with our customers and our employees, we used our platform to drive about $16 million in nonprofit donations based in the U.S. and Canada.

TRADEMARKS
Our most notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Zella, BP. and Treasure & Bond. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely, provided it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal.
SEASONALITY
Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations and cyclical trends in consumer spending. Our sales are typically higher in our second quarter, which usually includes most of our Anniversary Sale, and in the fourth quarter due to the holidays. Approximately one week of our Anniversary Sale shifted from the third quarter in 2021 to the second quarter in 2022. 
Results for any one quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to the Anniversary Sale and in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (typically from November through December). Consistent with our seasonal fluctuations, our working capital requirements have historically increased during the months leading up to the Anniversary Sale and the holidays as we purchase inventory in anticipation of increased sales.
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
We operate in a highly competitive business environment. We regularly compete with other international, national, regional and local retailers, including internet-based businesses, omni-channel department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores and boutiques, which may carry similar lines of merchandise. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the keys to competing in our industry are what will always matter most to our customers: providing compelling product and outstanding service, both digitally and in stores, backed by people who care. This includes serving customers on their terms by providing a seamless digital and physical experience, offering compelling, curated and quality products across a range of price points, and strategically partnering with relevant and limited distribution brands, all in top markets.
