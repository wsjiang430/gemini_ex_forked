 Item 1. Business.
 As used in this annual report, unless the context otherwise indicates, any reference to ‘Membership Collective Group,’ ‘MCG,’ ‘our company,’ ‘the company,’ ‘us,’ ‘we’ and ‘our’ refers (i) prior to the exchange of equity interests by equity holders in Soho House Holdings Limited for shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock (as applicable) in Membership Collective Group Inc. to Soho House Holdings Limited and its consolidated subsidiaries and (ii) following such exchange, to Membership Collective Group Inc., the issuer of the Class A Common Stock being referred hereby, together with its consolidated subsidiaries.
OUR BUSINESS
 The Membership Collective Group (“MCG”) is a global membership platform of physical and digital spaces that connects a vibrant, diverse group of members from across the world. These members use the MCG platform to both work and socialize, to connect, create, have fun and drive a positive change.
 We began with the opening of the first Soho House in 1995 and remain the only company to have scaled a private membership platform with a global presence. Over the last 28 years, we have significantly expanded our membership expertise and diversified our offerings—both physically and digitally. As of January 1, 2023, we have approximately 226,800 members (including approximately 162,000 Soho House members) who engage with MCG through our global portfolio of 40 Soho Houses, 9 Soho Works, Scorpios Beach Club in Mykonos, Soho Home, our interiors and lifestyle retail brand, and our digital channels. The Ned hotels in London, New York and Doha and the LINE and Saguaro hotels in North America also form part of MCG’s wider portfolio.

The central pillar of MCG is Soho House, which drives the majority of our membership and revenue today. A Soho House membership offers access to a network of distinctive and carefully curated Houses, across North America, the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia, which serve as the cornerstone of our member experience. We enhance our member experience through our digital channels, including the Soho House App and our website. Our vision for the Soho House App has always been for it to be like having a House in your pocket. It’s our central destination for members to make bookings, invite guests, make payments, and connect with each other. Annually, we host thousands of member events worldwide, spanning film, fashion, art, food and drink, well-being, work and music—and help our members forge connections to bring them closer together.
 Our membership expertise, honed through the growth of Soho House, has led to our evolution into the Membership Collective Group, a home to numerous memberships including Cities Without Houses, Soho Works, Soho Friends and Ned’s Club. By designing, curating and growing our membership offering, our membership platform can respond to shifting lifestyle trends and the evolution of our members’ needs. Our memberships work together, allowing us to reach new audiences with a set of interconnected offerings.
 Everything we do across these memberships begins and ends with our members. The foundation of our member experience has been crafted over our 28-year history and is built on the following pillars:
 •Membership: We are in the business of forging connections and bringing people together. Our diverse global membership is the soul of our company. It is the people that define our culture and shape the experience – in turn attracting new members.
 •Physical and digital spaces: We create and operate interconnected spaces. Each of our physical locations is designed to reflect our members and the local community that they serve. Our digital platforms extend our connection with members beyond our physical spaces, in turn significantly enhancing the member experience.
 •Design: Our design DNA is instantly recognizable across all of our membership models, whether in our Houses, Soho Works, The Ned, Scorpios Beach Club or Soho Home. While each House and property is unique, they each have a consistency in their architectural and interior style that has come to define the Soho House experience. In each new House or site that we develop for our other brands, this style is interpreted for local tastes and preferences, reflecting the culture of the respective city.
 •Services, products and experiences: Our member-obsessed culture drives us to relentlessly improve the quality of the services, products and experiences we offer to our members. We do not cut corners or compromise on quality, taking the long-term view that there is no substitute for the highest quality services, products and experiences when it comes to fostering loyalty from our members.
 •Innovation: We have always strived to adapt and evolve by anticipating our members’ needs and wants. Innovation has always been part of our culture and approach, and we have used that mindset to create new memberships to serve a wider audience of people who desire personal connection via new channels.
 •House Foundations: We are committed to integrating the pillars of our social responsibility and sustainability program, House Foundations, into everything we do.
 Our membership has remained resilient through multiple economic cycles and the COVID-19 pandemic. When our physical sites were forced to close as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was minimal impact on the retention of Soho House members. The power of our model is driven by the important role we believe that we play in our members’ lives and the value we consistently provide them for their membership fees. We believe our retention compares very favorably to leading consumer subscriptions or memberships—across music, media, fitness, entertainment and commerce—despite, in many cases, their significantly lower price points.
 The demand for our membership is also demonstrated by our large and growing global wait list, which as of January 1, 2023 stands at over 86,000 applicants. Awareness of our distinct membership offerings and their scarcity is spread by our members organically through word of mouth, social media and press coverage.
 There are multiple consumer forces at play that have increased the relevance of our memberships. We have observed a secular shift in the ways that people live and work—with less time spent in traditional corporate offices and more time in social spaces that encourage creativity and mutual engagement. We believe that these trends will only accelerate, and that the freedom to be able to choose where to live and work—particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic—will likely have a significant impact on our target market. We believe this will create an even greater demand for curated communities that can grow and thrive in a more deliberate environment.
 OUR ASSET LIGHT STRATEGY
 Historically we have made significant investments in the development of our Houses, either in purchasing an ownership position and/or making material investment in the build out of the property alongside our landlords. Beginning several years ago, with the growing reputation of Soho House as a marquee tenant, we began making a conscious shift to an asset light development model to

conserve and drive improved return on our capital. Under this model, our landlord agrees to fund a substantial portion, or all, of the development costs of a House, to our design specifications, leaving us to fund only pre-opening expenses (and art and other unique interior design elements). Virtually all of the Houses that we plan to open in the foreseeable future reflect this asset-light model.
 While our investment in our full-size Houses has historically approached, or in certain cases exceeded, $10 million, under our asset-light model we expect our contribution to open new Houses, comprised primarily of pre-opening expenses and art, will fall, on average, in the $3 million to $6 million range. Despite a modest increase in average rents from this strategy, we believe the considerably reduced capital investment will result in meaningfully improved cash-on-cash returns and capital efficiency.
 
A new Soho House membership incurs virtually no membership acquisition cost, since we do not conduct any paid marketing. Driven by consistently high retention and minimal costs associated with retaining or supporting our members, Soho House enjoys a very attractive member lifetime value. We believe new memberships will also provide compelling economics and be accretive to our profit, as they can be created and operated in an asset-light manner that leverages the existing platform.

 OUR MEMBERSHIP PLATFORM
 All of our memberships have been built to enrich the lives of their members, as well as expand our membership offering to a broader audience.


Soho House
 Soho House remains at the core of our membership platform by creating a foundation upon which additional membership businesses can be built and scaled. While our physical Houses provide our foundation, the people inside them are the soul of Soho House. As a membership founded for the creative industries, we are proud to have championed members who have gone on to shape our cultural landscape as world class writers, artists, performers, directors, founders, designers, and producers – all reflecting the spirit and energy of Soho House.
 The membership of each House is assembled by a select committee of influential creatives and innovators that represent the local area in which the membership is founded. Our members actively engage in creating the culture of each House, helping to shape and localize it by participating in member events and contributing to editorial and digital content. We believe this adds to the value of each House, enriching the membership and enhancing the attractiveness of membership to prospective members worldwide. With a new US Every House annual membership fee of approximately $4,500, providing access to all of our Houses globally, we believe our membership offering provides compelling value to our members that increases as we add new Houses and more members to our global community. Our Houses attract members from every demographic, with members from “Generation Z” (26 years old and younger) and “Millennials”(27- to 42-year-olds) constituting the fastest-growing cohorts. We also believe that the pricing of our In-House offerings represents great value to our members because of the level of quality provided, reinforcing the overall membership experience, rewarding their brand loyalty and creating opportunities for future and recurring revenues.
 We created the following types of membership under Soho House to reach a broader audience and enhance the experience of our existing members:
 •Cities Without Houses
 In 2017, we introduced a new type of Soho House membership known as Cities Without Houses ("CWH"), which opens up the Soho House membership to people who live in cities where we do not yet have a physical House. This membership allows us to welcome members to our global community in new geographies, generates additional revenues on our existing base of Houses and provides intelligence for future growth, which we have employed to open new Houses in certain locations, including Nashville, US (February 2022), Brighton, UK (March 2022) Copenhagen, Denmark (July 2022) and Stockholm, Sweden (December 2022). As of January 1, 2023, we have 6,800 CWH members across 73 cities.
 •Soho Friends
 There are a significant number of people who enjoy the Soho House way of living and who have already visited our Houses as guests, stayed in our bedrooms, or visited our public restaurants and spas, but do not currently have a Soho House membership. To respond to this audience, we launched Soho Friends in November 2020 for an annual subscription cost of approximately $130. We offer access to physical spaces, including Soho House bedrooms, and screenings, with additional benefits from our restaurants, spas and online retail brands, although Soho Friends do not have full access to our Houses. As of January 1, 2023, we had 58,222 Soho Friends members. We intend to grow this membership brand in a measured way so that our Soho House members continue to account for the majority of visitors to our Houses and restaurants.
Soho Home
 Soho Home was created as a result of the consistent requests from our members to recreate the look and feel of the Houses in their own homes. Soho Home is an interiors and lifestyle retail brand that offers handcrafted furniture, lighting, textiles, tableware and accessories mostly through ecommerce. Over the past few years, we have transformed Soho Home into a high growth retail business. At the beginning of August 2022, we merged our SOHO HOME+ membership into Soho Friends.
Soho Works
 First launched in 2015, Soho Works provides its members with the space and resources to work alongside other like-minded individuals and businesses—facilitating connections and providing the tools to flourish. Aimed primarily at existing Soho House and Soho Friends members, Soho Works draws on the same design principles and membership ethos as Soho House, but is a space purposed entirely for work and creative collaboration.
 Beginning with one location in London, we have since opened eight additional sites in London, New York and Los Angeles over the last two years and as of January 1, 2023, we had 6,633 Soho Works members. Soho Works membership rates vary by location and Soho House membership status. For Soho House members, a US Soho Works membership fee ranges from $400 to $750 per month, depending on membership type.
Scorpios Beach Club


Set in a cove on the southern tip of Mykonos, Scorpios offers a one of a kind beach experience with a well-established globally recognized brand. With a restaurant, terraces and daybeds, and a distinctive wellness offering, Scorpios enriches the lives of its guests who are looking to escape from their daily lives. We believe the Scorpios concept has significant potential to expand into additional locations as a key part of our platform and we expect to open our second site in Tulum, Mexico in 2024.
The Ned
 The Ned brand seeks to embody a “city within a city” full-service destination, by playing host to multiple restaurants, bedrooms, a range of grooming services, spa, gym and a full-service members’ club. The membership offered by The Ned (“Ned’s Club”) including Ned’s Friends is aimed at a broader group of professional people. As of January 1, 2023, Ned’s Club London has approximately 3,000 members. In June 2022, The Ned NoMad in New York opened which covers 117,000 sq ft and includes a Ned’s Club, Cecconi's restaurant, as well as 167 bedrooms. As of January 1, 2023, The Ned NoMad has over 1,600 members. The Ned in Doha opened in November 2022, which as of January 1, 2023 had over 360 members. The Ned offers its members The Ned’s Club app, which allows members to make bookings, publish benefits, events and club related information. We receive management fees under hotel management contracts for each of the operations of The Ned sites.
 The LINE
 On June 22, 2021, we acquired the operating agreements relating to the ‘The LINE’ and ‘Saguaro’ hotels. The hotels that are currently operational are located in Los Angeles, Washington, Austin, Palm Springs, and San Francisco (opened September 2022), and among them offer a variety of food and beverage offerings together with approximately 1,500 hotel rooms. We receive management fees under hotel management contract for the operation of these hotels. The transaction has broadened our geographic reach in North America. Refer to Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 - Acquisitions for further information.
 OUR GROWTH PLAN
 The core Soho House business is our key driver of global expansion. We are primarily focused on growing and enhancing Soho House membership value proposition to drive long-term recurring revenue as well as delivering operational excellence to drive profitability and free cash flow. 
Membership is the core to everything we do and growing and enhancing the membership experience remains the core driver of growth for the business. Expansion of Soho House into new areas is exciting for us and our members, and both furthers the reach of and strengthens our brand. Opening Houses in existing cities satisfies unmet demand (as represented by our local wait lists), and leverages our existing infrastructure.
 During fiscal 2022, we increased our total House count to 40 Houses compared to 33 Houses as of the end of fiscal 2021. Our recent development pipeline has extended our global footprint to exciting cities such as Nashville, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Brighton (UK). We continue to see substantial long-term growth opportunities in the Asia Pacific, Africa and South America regions. We currently anticipate a long-term growth target of five to seven Soho House openings annually over time. Our current pipeline anticipates our Soho House portfolio expanding to 45-47 Houses by year-end 2023.
Notably, aside from the temporary closure of certain Houses for public health and safety reasons (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or for refurbishment, we have never closed a House at any point in our 28-year history. We have a proven track record of consistently opening successful new sites that achieve member growth targets.
 We have developed a digital platform that enables and supports all our memberships. The platform is a collection of software, both off the shelf and that which has been built in-house, and supports experience digitally for both prospective members and existing members, through our app, website, contact centers and in our physical spaces. The platform is scalable enabling it to support our continuing international growth secure and rich with features (including digital membership card, multiple types of bookings, guest invitations, payments, content publishing, subscription management and social connectivity) that manage and improve member experience. Our global website is the primary place for new member acquisitions and majority of our members use the app regularly.
 In fiscal 2022, there were over one million non-member guests who visited our Houses, many of whom visited frequently. Our intention is to continue to convert these customers into Soho Friends and House members. We continue to leverage our House Guest system to collect data and better understand our customers and visitors. Through this and offering access to bedrooms and discounts, we continue to convert many of these visitors into Soho House and Soho Friends members. In addition, our members and guests get to experience the design elements of our houses and often are interested in buying them for their own homes. In fiscal 2022, Soho Home grew its sales by 97% and we believe Soho Home has significant potential to continue its strong growth. We also continue to grow Soho Works members as well as expanding Scorpios and The Ned, where we have a management contract, to additional locations.
 HOUSE FOUNDATIONS


Our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) program, House Foundations, is focused on making a positive impact on our people, the lives of our members and the environment.
Aligning with the key impact areas of our business, our ESG strategy has a focus on value creation to attract and retain members and employees and to protect our surroundings, as part of a long-term goal to support the sustainable growth of Soho House.
 People are at the heart of everything we do, and as such, our ESG progress to date has had a principal emphasis on social impact. As a global membership of creatives, we are committed to using our platform to help people from underrepresented and lower socio-economic backgrounds gain access to the creative industries. Alongside this, we have strong focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in our teams and supply chain, and on supporting the communities around us, through Soho Give.
We have also developed a sustainability program to reduce the impact of our business on the environment. We have set ambitious 2030 goals, as well as yearly roadmaps to reduce carbon emissions in our direct operations and supply chain in line with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, to promote responsible consumption and divert food and non-food waste from landfill, to minimize environmentally harmful practices in our sites, and to uphold an environmental and ethical standard in our supply chain through a supplier code of conduct. Our impact is tracked and measured against the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and to show our commitment to working towards a fair and sustainable planet we have signed the UN Global Compact.
 House Foundations is the vision of our Founder Nick Jones and is led and championed by our CEO Andrew Carnie and CFO Thomas Allen, the Board and our wider leadership team. Our internal team, supported by our expert external advisors (The Sustainability Group), aims to integrate social, environmental and ethical practices into the running of our business.
 We believe House Foundations adds more to our member experience and improves the well-being of our teams. This strategy has been supported by the findings of a materiality assessment carried out in 2022, in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders.
 SEASONALITY
 The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand vary from property to property, depending principally upon their location and type of property. However, results were less predictable as a result of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions. Our revenue generally fluctuates quarterly and is expected to be highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue benefits from holiday season spending while first quarter revenue is affected by colder weather impacting tourism to some of our major markets and a general reduction in in-house expenditures by members in January following the end of the holiday season.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Our portfolio of brand offerings, including Soho House, Soho Works, Scorpios, The Ned, the LINE and Saguaro, Cowshed, Soho House Design, Soho Home and Cecconi’s, and the digital platform that supports these are very important to us. We rely on trademarks, copyrights, know-how and expertise, registered domain names, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We seek to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, know-how and brand, by relying on a combination of federal, state, and common law rights in the US and other jurisdictions, as well as on contractual measures. As of February 22, 2023, we owned approximately 84 registered US trademarks, 13 pending US trademark applications, 544 registered non-US trademarks and 54 pending non-US trademark applications. As of February 22, 2023, we owned approximately 709 US and international registered domain names, including www.sohohouse.com and www.membershipcollectivegroup.com.
 Our strategy for opening any operation is to register national trademarks early in the process of expanding into new territories to prevent third parties from trademark squatting and registering their own competing trademarks before us. However, the efforts we take and have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. For example, brand squatting is an issue for us, particularly in places such as South America and Asia. In China and Australia, the presence of third-party rights holders with ‘Soho’ trademarks has made registering our ‘Soho House’ trademark a challenge. Where there are third-party rights in a particular jurisdiction, we generally assess the risk associated with such rights and take steps to oppose or negotiate with the trademark owner as appropriate, to protect our family of brands from dilution and customer confusion. Additionally, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us. Our trademarks have in the past and may in the future be opposed, contested, circumvented or found to be unenforceable, weak or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating them. To counter infringement or unauthorized use of our trademarks, we may deem it necessary to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any failure to obtain, maintain, protect, defend and enforce our intellectual property, including due to ‘brand squatting,’ could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business and operations."


INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, DATA PRIVACY AND CYBERSECURITY
 We are committed to protecting the security of member data and other personally identifiable information ("PII"). We undertake measures to protect our systems, including the Soho House App and our website, and the member data and other PII that our systems collect, store, share, transmit, disclose and otherwise process. We have developed policies and procedures designed to manage data security risks. We employ technical security defenses, monitor servers and systems, and use technical measures such as data encryption. We also use third parties to assist in our security practices as well as to prevent and detect fraud. We are subject to a number of stringent, complex and evolving federal, state and local data protection, privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, policies, industry standards and other legal obligations in the US and around the world. Any actual or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any applicable federal, state, local or similar foreign laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, policies, certifications or orders relating to data privacy and security, or any compromise of security, including in connection with the Soho House App, that results in the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or misappropriation of PII or other member data, could result in significant awards, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties or judgments, proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions and negative publicity and reputational harm, one or all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Technology and Data—A cybersecurity attack, ‘data breach’ or other security incident experienced by us or our third-party service providers may result in negative publicity, claims, investigations and litigation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Technology and Data—If we fail to properly maintain the confidentiality and integrity of our data, including member and customer credit or debit card and bank account information and other PII, or if we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to data privacy, protection and security, it may adversely affect our reputation, business and operations.”
 
We expect to continue to invest in technology capabilities to support, protect and drive our business.
 EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 As of February 28, 2023, Soho House employed 7,714 individuals including in our support offices of whom 943 are based at our support offices in London, New York and Los Angeles.
 Labor laws in the United Kingdom and European Union provide minimum standards regarding annual paid and unpaid leave, sick leave, maternity leave and other provisions regarding leave from work, severance pay, pension contributions and other terms of employment. We contribute to pension schemes (or similar type schemes) for our employees in the United Kingdom and European Union.
 We are committed to a policy of recruitment, promotion and training on the basis of aptitude and ability. We have dedicated Diversity, Learning, and Inclusion teams across all four of our major regions of the Americas, United Kingdom, Europe, and Asia, and we offer a wide range of training and development programs. Training offered includes customer service and leadership courses to food tasting and cocktail training, first aid at work and health and safety courses. Diversity & Inclusion forms part of all training we conduct, as well as its own learning series designed for Senior Leadership to line staff level. We also operate dedicated Cook House and House Tonic training programs for our chefs and bartenders to ensure that each customer receives consistent food and drink across all of our Houses and restaurants. We are committed to encouraging people development and retention, including by providing sponsorship so that employees can increase know-how and widen their skill bases by attending third-party training and courses. We also operate a group-wide program that rewards employees that go the extra mile.
 We have built a robust pledge and commitment to Diversity & Inclusion across all our functions in areas of representation, recruitment, culture, education, community engagement, and accountability. Our mission statement and values set have also been rewritten to support these initiatives. In our pledge we have committed to increasing the BIPOC representation in our leadership, as well as any underrepresented functions like Design and Retail — and we are able to achieve this by extensive outreach to diverse organizations and networks in our recruitment initiatives. We have rolled out a global training series on anti-racism and allyship and we have built an internal diversity steering committee consisting of a mix of employees from all levels across the global business to hold our executives accountable for the delivery of this pledge. Our employee handbook reflects progressive policies regarding Parental Leave, Flexible Working, and Company Sick Pay. We have developed a performance driven culture with feedback platforms that allow for objective evaluations of our staff and development plans for their growth.
 With a view to building a strong community within our workforce, we have implemented dedicated communication channels for employees, led by Facebook Workplace.
 COMPETITION


We believe that we are the only company to have pioneered and scaled a private membership club platform with global presence, and our first-mover advantage has created a significant barrier to entry.
 Though we face direct competition from other private members’ clubs that exist in proximity to our own Houses (as well as in numerous segments of the restaurant, hotel, co-working spaces, fitness and beauty care services and products industries), we believe that we do not have a direct competitor given the combination of different sectors in which we operate, combined with our geographical reach. Some membership clubs use a similar model, but we do not believe that they have been able to replicate our reach across the multiple cities, continents, and spaces in which we operate. In our view, there is a high barrier to entry, as to catch up with the size of our platform would take significant time and investment.
 We believe that these business sectors are each highly competitive. Primary competitive factors include name recognition, demographic considerations, effectiveness of public relations and brand recognition, level of service, convenience of location, quality of the property, pricing, product or service and range and quality of services and amenities offered.
 We also compete with other restaurants, boutique hotels, co-working spaces, beauty care providers and retailers on a local level, as well as on a global level against certain larger chains with properties in the markets in which we operate.
 REGULATION
 We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and beverages, building, zoning and environmental requirements, health and safety and fire codes, data privacy, protection and security and general business license and permit requirements, in the various jurisdictions in which we design, construct, manage, lease and/or own or operate properties. In addition, the retail nature of a portion of our business requires us to comply with laws and regulations concerning product safety and testing, as well as consumer rights. Our ability to develop new Houses and privately commissioned projects and to remodel, refurbish or add to our existing Houses is also dependent on obtaining permits from local authorities.
 Regulations concerning the supply and sale of alcoholic beverages require us to apply to relevant local authorities for a license that must be renewed (usually on an annual basis) and which may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Applicable alcoholic beverage control regulations and licensing conditions apply to the supply of alcohol across our business, including in relation to the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, other relationships with alcohol manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages.
 We are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics, work permits and benefit offerings. Federal, state and provincial laws and regulations require certain registration, disclosure statements, compliance with specific standards of conduct and other practices with respect to issuance of memberships.
 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
 We are committed to providing safe and healthy premises, that are compliant with environmental, health and safety regulations, for our members and other customers to enjoy and our colleagues to work in. Our operations and properties are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety requirements in the UK, the US and every other country and locality in which we operate. We have an internal team of safety professionals who support the business through providing advice and guidance on compliance and best practices, auditing and monitoring site conditions along with compliance with both our safety management system and legislative requirements, and updating our environmental, health and safety management systems in light of new or changes to existing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
 From time to time, our operations or products have resulted in, or may result in, non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, environmental, health and safety laws or regulations. Historically, the costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with environmental laws and regulations have not been material. However, we cannot assure you that future costs and expenses required for us to comply with any new, or changes to existing, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or new or discovered environmental conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
