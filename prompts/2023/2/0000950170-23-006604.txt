INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BUSINESS
Boom Trucks
 A boom truck is a straight telescopic boom crane outfitted with a hook and winch which is mounted on a standard flatbed commercial (Class 7 or 8) truck chassis. Relative to other lifting equipment, boom trucks provide increased versatility, with some models capable of transporting relatively large payloads from site to site at highway speeds. A boom truck is usually sold with outriggers, pads and devices for reinforcing the chassis in order to improve safety and stability. Although produced in a wide range of models and sizes, boom trucks can be broadly distinguished by their normal lifting capability as light, medium, and heavy-cranes. Various models of medium or heavy-lift boom trucks can safely lift loads from 15- to 90-tons and operating radii can exceed 200 feet. Another advantage of the boom truck is the ability to provide occasional man lift capabilities at a very low cost to height ratio. While it is not uncommon to see a very old boom truck, most replacement cycles trend to seven years. The market for boom trucks has historically been cyclical.

Although the Company offers a complete line of boom trucks from light to heavy capacity cranes, much of our efforts have been devoted to the development of higher capacity boom trucks specifically designed to meet the particular needs of customers including those in energy production and electrical power distribution. We believe it is an advantage to be skewed towards the heavier lifting capacity, since the heavier capacity cranes have higher margins.

The Company has developed an electric option called Manitex ECSY (Electric Crane System). The ECSY system is a practical innovation, allowing owners the flexibility to operate the crane remotely on chassis diesel hydraulic power with a supplemental electric motor which can be engaged when the crane is stationary and operate on locally available electric power sources.
 
Markets that drive demand for boom trucks include power distribution, oil and gas recovery, infrastructure and new home, commercial and industrial construction. Historically, the new home construction market, which uses lower capacity cranes, has been the most cyclical. Over the past few years, demand from the energy sector has become more cyclical in part due to changes in oil prices.

The Company sells its boom trucks through a network of over forty full-service dealers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South America, and the Middle East. A number of our dealers maintain a rental fleet of their own. Boom trucks can be rented for either short or long-term periods.

Knuckle Boom Cranes
PM knuckle boom cranes are hydraulic folding and articulating cranes, mounted on a commercial chassis, with lifting capacities that range from small (lifting capacity up to three-ton meter) to super heavy (lifting capacity up to two-hundred-and-ten-ton meter), often supplied with a jib for additional reach. The knuckle boom has a compact design and footprint which can be mounted on a chassis to maximize the load carrying capability. Combined with the crane’s ability to operate in a compact footprint the ability to carry a payload provides a competitive advantage over other truck mounted cranes and makes the knuckle boom crane particularly attractive for a variety of end uses in the construction and product delivery sectors.


The knuckle boom crane market is a global market with a wide variety of end sector applications, but focused particularly on residential and non-residential construction, road and bridge infrastructure development, waste management and utility applications. PM knuckle boom cranes are sold into a variety of geographies including West and East Europe, Central Asia, Africa, North and Central America, South America, the Middle East and the Far East and Pacific region. Historically, PM focused on its domestic and local Western European markets, but in recent years has expanded its sales and distribution efforts internationally. PM has six international sales and distribution offices located in the Far East and in Latin America.
The market for knuckle boom cranes has been growing in recent years as the acceptability of the product has grown and its advantages have been accepted. Growth in North America, where the straight-mast boom truck crane has been the more dominant product, has been more rapid in recent years in combination with the overall improvement in the North American construction sector. PM’s share of the North American market has been historically low; however, we believe that this is an area of growth opportunity for the Company.
Aerial Work Platforms
Oil & Steel aerial platforms are self-propelled or truck mounted and places an operator in a basket in the air in order to perform maintenance, repairs or similar activities. The equipment is used in a variety of applications including utilities, sign work and industrial maintenance and is often sold to rental operations.
 Oil & Steel serves a number of geographies in North America, Western and Eastern Europe and sells through dealers as well as its own sales and distribution offices and two subsidiaries in Spain and France. In North America, products are sold under the Manitex brand and through its distribution network. The market generally follows the domestic economic cycle for any particular country. Consequently, the market has shown a positive trend in the past several years.
 Industrial Cranes
As of January 2022, the Company had discontinued the industrial crane product line.
Valla Cranes
Valla product line of industrial cranes is a full range of precision pick and carry cranes from 2 to 44 tons, using electric, diesel, and hybrid power options. Its cranes offer wheeled or tracked, and fixed or swing boom configurations, with special applications designed specifically to meet the needs of its customers. The product is sold internationally through dealers and into the rental distribution channel.
Equipment Distribution
C&M is a United States distributor of the Company’s products. C&M Leasing rents equipment manufactured by the Company as well as a limited amount of equipment manufactured by third parties.
Part Sales
 As part of our operations, we supply repair and replacement parts for our products. The parts business margins are generally higher than our overall margins. Part sales as a percentage of revenues tend to increase when there is a down-turn in the industry. Part sales as a percentage of revenues are approximately 12% for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Company Revenues by Sources
 The sources of the Company’s revenues are summarized below:
 

 | 2022 | | | 2021
Boom trucks, knuckle boom & truck cranes | | 53 | % | | 61 | %
Aerial platforms | | 14 | % | | 13 | %
Part and merchandise sales | | 12 | % | | 12 | %
Rental | | 7 | % | | 0 | %
Other equipment | | 12 | % | | 11 | %
Services | | | % | | | %
Net Revenue | | 100 | % | | 100 | %

 
In 2022 and 2021 no customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s revenue.

Raw Materials
The Company purchases a variety of components used in the production of its products. The Company purchases steel and a variety of machined parts, components and subassemblies including weldments, winches, cylinders, frames, rims, axles, wheels, tires, suspensions, cables, booms and cabs, as well as engines, transmissions and cabs. Additionally, Manitex and PM mount their cranes on commercial truck chassis, which are either purchased by the Company or supplied by the customer. Lead times for these materials (including chassis) historically varied from several weeks to many months. The Company is vulnerable to a supply interruption in instances when only one supplier has been qualified. Identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers can be very time consuming, and in some cases, could take longer than a year. The Company has been working on qualifying secondary sources of some products to assure supply consistency and to reduce costs. The degree to which our supply base can respond to changes in market demand directly affects our ability to increase production and the Company attempts to maintain some additional inventory in order to react to unexpected increases in demand.
Supply chain issues have impacted the Company and we expect this to continue to cause disruption in 2023. The disruptions continue to put a strain on our team and resources, specifically on our electronic components and truck chassis. Future supply chain issues that might impact the Company will in part depend on how fast the rate of growth is for a product. Strong general economic growth could put us in competition for parts with other industries. Additionally, events or circumstances at a particular supplier could impact the availability of a necessary component.
Patents and Trademarks
The Company protects its trade names and trademarks through registration. Its technology consists of bill of materials, drawings, plans, vendor sources and specifications and although the Company’s technology has considerable value, it does not generally have patent protection. The Company has (on rare occasions) filed for patent protection on a specific feature. In the future, the Company will consider seeking patent protection on any new design features believed to present a significant future benefit.
 The Company owns and uses several trademarks relating to its brands that have significant value and are instrumental to the Company’s ability to market its products. The Company’s most significant trademark is “Manitex” (presently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office until 2027). Badger Equipment Company previously marketed its products under the “Little Giant” and "Badger" trade names which were discontinued during January 2022. Valla markets its products under the “Valla” tradename. PM sells its products using the trademark “PM” and PM subsidiary, PM Oil & Steel S.p.A. sells its products using the “OIL & STEEL” trademark. The Manitex, Valla, PM and OIL & STEEL trademarks and trade names are important to the marketing and operation of the Company’s business as a significant number of our products are sold under those names. PM has three patents. One is registered with the Italian Patents and Trademarks Office until 2028. PM has two additional patents registered with The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market for Trademarks, ("OHIM") that are in force until 2031 and 2034, respectively.
Seasonality
 Traditionally, the Company’s peak selling periods for cranes are the second and fourth quarters of a calendar year. A significant portion of cranes sold over the last several years have been deployed in specialized industries or applications, such as energy, residential and commercial construction. Sales in these markets are subject to significant fluctuations which correlate more with general economic conditions and the prices of commodities and generally are not of a seasonal nature. Crane repairs are performed throughout the year, but are somewhat affected by the slowdown in construction activity during the typically harsh winters in the Midwestern United States.
 The sale of parts is much less seasonal given the geographic breadth of the customer base.

Competition
 The market for the Company’s boom trucks, knuckle boom cranes, and industrial cranes is highly competitive. The Company competes based on product design, quality of products and services, product performance, maintenance costs and price. Several competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing and distribution resources than we do. The Company believes that it effectively competes with its competitors.
 
The Company’s boom cranes compete with cranes manufactured by National Crane, Custom Truck One Source, Elliott and Altec and Weldco Beales. The Company’s knuckle boom cranes compete with Palfinger, Fassi, Effer and HIAB.

While no geographic limitations exist regarding the business’s ability to sell cranes internationally, the lack of any barriers to entry and the heavy use of the internet make this a highly active and competitive market in which to distribute cranes.
 
Parts sales are global in scope and benefit greatly from the internet and the tenure and expertise of our employees. While competition in this area is extensive, we believe that the breadth of the products offered and our long history in this part of the business is a competitive advantage.
 

The Company's rental business competes based on the design, quality and performance of the products it makes available for rental, price and the good maintenance and repair of the equipment it provides. Several competitors have greater financial, marketing and distribution resources than we do. The Company, however, believes that it effectively competes with its competitors.
 Backlog
 Backlog, which includes firm orders for equipment which we have not yet shipped as well as orders by foreign subsidiaries for international deliveries, was $230.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, up 22% from the end of 2021 and up 11% from the end of the third quarter of 2022. Backlog includes firm orders for equipment which has not yet shipped as well as orders by foreign subsidiaries for international deliveries.
The majority of the Company's backlog is expected to be filled within one year, although there can be no assurance that all such backlog orders will be filled within that time. Our backlog orders represent primarily new equipment orders. Parts sales are generally filled as ordered.
 Employees
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 601 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees. The Company has not experienced any work stoppages and anticipates continued good employee relations. Seven (7) of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements at our Badger subsidiary and are represented by International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (“UAW”) and its local No. 316. The current union contract expires on June 21, 2023. The Company acquired Rabern in April 2022 which has 63 employees across four (4) locations.
Governmental Regulation
 The Company is subject to various governmental regulations, such as environmental regulations, employment and health regulations, and safety regulations. We have various internal controls and procedures designed to maintain compliance with these regulations. The cost of compliance programs is not material but is subject to additions to or changes in federal, state or local legislation or changes in regulatory implementation or interpretation of government regulations.
