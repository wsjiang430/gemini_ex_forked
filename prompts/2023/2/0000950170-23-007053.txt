 Item 1. Business.
 Overview
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel product candidates to treat brain health disorders. Our mission is to be the global leader in the development and delivery of treatments that unlock new opportunities to improve patient outcomes. We are developing a pipeline of innovative product candidates, with and without acute perceptual effects, targeting neurotransmitter pathways that play key roles in brain health disorders. This specifically includes pharmaceutically optimized product candidates derived from the psychedelic and empathogen drug classes including MM-120 and MM-402, our lead product candidates.
 Our lead product candidate, MM-120, is a proprietary, pharmaceutically optimized form of lysergide D-tartrate that we are developing for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (“GAD”). MM-120 is also being studied in a subperceptual repeat administration dosing regimen for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”). Phase 2 studies for MM-120 in GAD and ADHD are ongoing and topline results from both trials are expected in late 2023.
 Our second lead product candidate, MM-402, also referred to as R(-)-MDMA, is our proprietary form of the R-enantiomer of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which we are developing for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (“ASD”). MDMA is a synthetic molecule that is often referred to as an empathogen because it is reported to increase feelings of connectedness and compassion. Preclinical studies of R(-)-MDMA demonstrate its acute pro-social and empathogenic effects, while its diminished dopaminergic activity suggest that it has the potential to exhibit less stimulant activity, neurotoxicity, hyperthermia and abuse liability compared to racemic MDMA or the S(+)-enantiomer. In the third quarter of 2022, our collaborator, University Hospital Basel (“UHB”) in Switzerland, began conducting a Phase 1 investigator-initiated trial of R(-)-MDMA, S(+)-MDMA and R/S-MDMA in healthy volunteers to compare the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and acute subjective, physiological and endocrine effects of the three molecules. We expect to present results from a preclinical study of MM-402 in a model of ASD in the first half of 2023 and to initiate a Phase 1 study of MM-402 in 2023 to characterize the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MM-402, and to evaluate early signals of efficacy to support our approach in targeting core symptoms of ASD.
Our third product candidate, MM-110, which has the non-proprietary name zolunicant, is 18-methoxycoronaridine, a congener of ibogaine, and is being developed for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. MM-110 is an α3β4 nicotinic cholinergic receptor antagonist that has been tested in preclinical models of withdrawal and substance use disorders. In those studies, MM-110 was shown to reduce signs of opioid withdrawal, and to reduce self-administration of opioids, stimulants and ethanol. We completed a Phase 1 trial of MM-110 in late 2021; however, in the third quarter of 2022, we determined that any further clinical development of our MM-110 program will be subject to the pursuit of non-dilutive sources of capital and collaborations with third parties.
 Beyond our clinical stage product candidates, we are pursuing a number of programs, primarily through external collaborations, through which we seek to expand our drug development pipeline and broaden the potential applications of our lead product candidates. These research and development programs include non-clinical, pre-clinical and human clinical trials and investigator-initiated trials (“IITs”) of additional product candidates and research compounds with our collaborators. Our external research programs include a broad multi-year exclusive research partnership with UHB in Switzerland. Under the partnership, we have exclusive worldwide rights to data, compounds and patent rights associated with UHB’s research on lysergide and a number of additional compounds, including data from preclinical studies and clinical trials investigating the effects of lysergide in patient populations and healthy volunteers. We also have an ongoing partnership agreement with MindShift Compounds AG to develop next-generation compounds utilizing the molecular backbone of classical psychedelics and empathogens. In addition, we have in the past and will continue to engage in other relevant research collaborations to support our ongoing development efforts and potential additions to our pipeline. Our research partnerships and IITs facilitate the advancement of our early-stage pipeline and support the potential identification of product candidates for additional company-sponsored drug development programs.
Our development strategy is closely complemented by a platform of digital medicine programs that we are developing to facilitate adoption, use, and access to our products, if they receive regulatory approval and are marketed. In particular, we are advancing multiple digital medicine programs, including software that is regulated as a medical device (“SaMD”) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), as evidence-based therapeutic interventions for patients and HCPs to diagnose, prevent, manage or treat brain health disorders, or to facilitate the use of certain pharmaceutical products. Our lead digital medicine program, the MindMed Session Monitoring System (“MSMS”) release readiness component, is a proprietary hardware/software platform designed to be used by HCPs during therapy sessions that involve pharmaceutical products with consciousness altering effects. Regulatory engagements with the FDA for the progression of this product candidate took place throughout late 2021 and 2022 and are expected to continue as we advance the development of MSMS and other potential SaMD programs. We are also continuing to evaluate the potential to pair these SaMDs, which may include wearables and the latest in machine learning, with pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies to give HCPs the ability

to optimize and better understand the patient journey and therapeutic outcomes from pre-care through after-care and to facilitate the adoption of certain of our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval and are commercialized.

Our business is premised on a growing body of research supporting the use of novel psychoactive compounds to treat a myriad of brain health disorders. For all product candidates, we intend to proceed through research and development, and with marketing of the product candidates that may ultimately be approved, if any, pursuant to the regulations of the FDA and the legislation in other jurisdictions. This entails, among other things, conducting clinical trials with research scientists, using internal and external clinical drug development teams, producing and supplying drugs according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), and conducting all trials and development in accordance with the regulations of the FDA, and other legislation in other jurisdictions.
 Our Strategy
 Our mission is to be the global leader in the development and delivery of treatments that unlock new opportunities to improve patient outcomes for brain health disorders. We intend to accomplish our mission by leading the field in (1) research, (2) development, (3) digital medicine, and (4) commercialization, scalability and patient access. Key elements of our strategy are to:
 •advance our clinical pipeline and submit new drug applications (“NDAs”), to the FDA, and conduct pre-launch activities with respect to any of our product candidates that have been successfully developed;
 •commercialize any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval, including the manufacture of commercial supplies;
 •continue our research and development efforts to evaluate the potential for our existing product candidates to treat additional indications, including by exploring new formulations or new delivery methods;
 •identify new targets, and generate and test new compounds and product candidates, with a focus on indications where we believe we can make well-informed, rapid go/no-go decisions, with the goal of developing a diversified portfolio of product candidates with differentiated features;
 •evaluate the market potential and regulatory pathways for our product candidates in the United Kingdom (the “UK”), European Union (the “EU”), and other countries outside the United States, and determine the best strategic and business opportunities to advance our product candidates in these markets;
 •continue to advance digital medicine programs, including conducting ongoing and planned clinical trials of our Session Monitoring System and other clinical and regulatory activities;
 •continue to build, maintain, defend, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio, including by utilizing the strengths of our proprietary chemistry platform and scientific know-how to expand our portfolio of new chemical entities to lessen our long-term reliance on the success of any one program and to facilitate long-term growth; and
 •continue to explore opportunities to establish agreements or alliances with other pharmaceutical companies, at the appropriate time, where we believe a collaboration will add significant value to our efforts, including through capabilities, infrastructure, speed or financial contributions, or to acquire new compounds, product candidates or products if we believe such opportunities will help us achieve our goals or meet other strategic objectives.
 

Our Product Candidate Pipeline
 The following table summarizes the status of our portfolio of product candidates:
 

MM-120 (Lysergide D-tartrate)
 
MM-120, or lysergide D-tartrate, is our proprietary product candidate, a pharmaceutically optimized form of lysergide D-tartrate being developed for GAD and other brain health disorders. Lysergide was first synthesized in 1938 and its psychoactive properties were discovered in 1943. From 1949 to 1966, lysergide was used by psychiatrists and researchers to gain insights into the world of brain health and to assist psychotherapy. The precise mechanism by which lysergide modulates anxiety is still under investigation, but recent neuroimaging studies have provided a plausible explanation for clinical efficacy in this disease area. Lysergide decreases the functional integrity of brain networks and the separation between networks while also enhancing neurogeneration. At the whole-brain level, lysergide increases functional connectivity between various brain regions and increases measures of functional ‘brain entropy’ across many functional systems. This increase in connectivity between brain regions is correlated with ego dissolution and other aspects of the lysergide experience that are believed to contribute to subsequent and persistent improvements in psychological functioning. Acute and persistent reconfiguration of brain networks—particularly prefrontal and default mode network regions—by lysergide may represent systems-level mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects in anxiety and other brain health disorders. Lysergide has been investigated for its applications in the treatment of anxiety associated with terminal cancer, alcohol use disorder, opioid use disorder, and depression, among other conditions.
 GAD is a chronic, often debilitating mental health disorder that affects approximately 6-10% of U.S. adults in their lifetimes. Symptoms of GAD include excessive anxiety and worry that persists for over six months, which can lead to significant impairments in social, occupational and other functioning, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. While there is substantial diagnostic overlap between GAD, major depressive disorder (“MDD”), and other major brain health disorders, there has been very little innovation focused on the treatment of GAD in the past several decades due to the shift in focus from anxiety disorders, like GAD, toward depressive disorders, like MDD. Over the near-term, we intend to prioritize the clinical research program of MM-120 in psychiatric disorders. Given the expansive body of evidence on the clinical effects of lysergide across multiple brain health disorders, at the appropriate time in the future we intend to explore indications in other disease areas
 As part of the development activities for MM-120, we are currently conducting two Phase 2 clinical trials:
 •Study MMED008: In 2022, we initiated a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study to assess the effect of four doses of MM-120 for the treatment of GAD patients; and
 •Study MMED007: In December 2021, we initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a proof of concept trial for the treatment of ADHD patients designed to assess the safety and efficacy of repeated low dose MM-120 administration. 


We expect to report topline results from both the MMED008 and MMED007 trials in late 2023. In addition, there are a number of studies ongoing or planned to be conducted under our broad research collaboration with UHB.
 MM-402 (R(-)-MDMA)
 
MM-402, or R(-)-MDMA, is our proprietary form of the R-enantiomer of MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine), which we are developing for the treatment of ASD. MDMA is a synthetic molecule that is often referred to as an empathogen because it is reported to increase feelings of connectedness and compassion. R(-)-MDMA is thought to increase the levels of serotonin and, to a lesser extent, norepinephrine, and dopamine, in the brain, resulting in feelings of increased sociability and interpersonal emotional warmth. Preclinical studies of R(-)-MDMA demonstrate its acute pro-social and empathogenic effects, while its diminished dopaminergic activity suggest that it could exhibit less stimulant activity, neurotoxicity, hyperthermia and abuse liability compared to racemic MDMA or the S(+)-enantiomer. In the third quarter of 2022, our collaborator, UHB, began conducting a Phase 1 investigator-initiated trial of R(-)-MDMA, S(+)-MDMA and R/S-MDMA in healthy volunteers to compare the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and acute subjective, physiological and endocrine effects of the three molecules. We expect to present results from a preclinical study of MM-402 in a model of ASD in the first half of 2023 and to initiate a Phase 1 study of MM-402 in 2023 to characterize the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MM-402, and to evaluate early signals of efficacy to support our approach in targeting core symptoms of ASD.
 ASD is a biologically based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Estimates of the prevalence of ASD vary with study methodology and the population that is evaluated. The overall prevalence of ASD in Europe, Asia, and the United States ranges from 2 to 25 per 1000, or approximately 1 in 40 to 1 in 500. The pathogenesis of ASD is incompletely understood. The general consensus is that ASD is caused by genetic factors that alter brain development resulting in the neurobehavioral phenotype. Environmental and perinatal factors account for few cases of ASD but may modulate underlying genetic factors. Existing psychopharmacologic agents do not target the core symptoms of ASD and are largely oriented around treating coexisting psychiatric illnesses and reducing behavioral dysregulation.
 Further Exploration of Novel Biopharmaceuticals and Other Areas of Interest
 
Beyond our lead product candidates, we have several additional programs, primarily through external collaborations, through which we seek to expand our drug development pipeline and broaden the potential application of our lead product candidates. These research programs include non-clinical, pre-clinical and human clinical trials, and IITs of novel biopharmaceuticals, both with and without perceptual effects, with our collaborators. Our partnered research programs include a broad multi-year exclusive research partnership with UHB and a partnership with Maastricht University in the Netherlands. We also have an active partnership with MindShift Compounds AG to develop and patent a portfolio of research compounds, both with and without perceptual effects, related to the phenethylamine, tryptamine, and ergoline chemical classes. These research collaborations include IITs, drug discovery activities, advanced drug delivery activities and the advancement of other research activities that seek to support the growth and advancement of our product development programs.
 In addition to the above, our product candidate MM-110 (zolunicant or 18-methoxycoronaridine (“18-MC”)) is being developed for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. Animal studies have demonstrated that MM-110 can significantly reduce drug self-administration of morphine, cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine and alcohol, and ameliorate five of seven signs of opioid withdrawal. We completed a Phase 1 trial of MM-110 in late 2021, in which a total of 77 subjects were administered up to 325 mg of MM-110 twice (on a single day) or were administered up to 90 mg of MM-110 twice daily for seven days. Following feedback from the FDA related to the additional requirements to enable the conduct of a Phase 2a clinical trial in the US, in the third quarter of 2022, we determined that any further clinical development of our MM-110 program will be subject to the pursuit of non-dilutive sources of capital and collaborations with third parties.
 
Our Digital Medicine Programs
 Our drug development strategy is closely complemented by a platform of digital medicine programs that we are developing to facilitate adoption, use, and access to our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval and are commercialized. In particular, we are developing multiple digital medicine programs, including regulated SaMD products, as evidence-based therapeutic interventions for patients and HCPs to diagnose, prevent, manage or treat brain health disorders, or to facilitate the use of certain pharmaceutical products. We are also continuing to evaluate the potential to pair these SaMD products, which may include wearables and the latest in machine learning, with pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies to give HCPs the ability to optimize and better understand the patient journey and therapeutic outcomes from pre-care through after-care.


Our digital medicine programs are oriented to applications during two primary clinical periods: activities during a treatment session (referred to as “intrasession”) and activities between treatment sessions (referred to as “intersession”). Each digital medicine programs consists of a platform that contains separate underlying components, some of which we anticipate will be within the scope of the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act’s definition of medical devices and others which we anticipate will not be regulated as medical devices. For the medical device products, we will engage with the FDA and other international regulatory authorities to receive guidance along the development pathway, culminating with a potential submission for regulatory clearance or approval. We expect that each SaMD program in development will be, for the purpose of FDA regulations, non-significant risk, Class I or Class II SaMD. In the EU, all digital product candidates are anticipated to be regulated as medical devices and/or combination products.
 The intrasession monitoring platform may include components that provide in-session monitoring for safety, efficacy and additional interventions; clinician decision support for drug and non-drug therapeutic sessions; and predictive models linking interventions and treatment outcomes. The intersession monitoring platform may include components that support patient education, engagement, preparation and assistance; deep digital diagnosis that allows greater granularity to complement Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (“DSM”) diagnoses; support for treatment selection: modality dose and timing; real world monitoring of trends for relapse prediction and re-treatment decisions; engagement in health maintenance behaviors; and AI models to inform psychotherapeutic intervention. Within our intersession monitoring platform, we have current product candidates that are being used in clinical studies for the detection and prediction of transdiagnostic agitation, and monitoring of patients with a range of psychiatric diagnoses. We also have products for measurement of anxiety disorders that are either currently collecting clinical data (from existing data sources), or are collecting, or will collect data in planned and ongoing clinical studies.
 Our lead digital medicine program, the MindMed Session Monitoring System release readiness component is proprietary hardware/software platform designed to be used by HCPs during therapy sessions involving pharmaceutical products with consciousness altering effects. The MSMS consists of (i) a hardware-based device kit, which includes a tablet, smart phone, smart watch, blood pressure monitor, (ii) instructions for use, and (iii) a user-facing mobile application, which consists of MSMS installed on tablet for use by the HCP, and MSMS installed on smart phone and smartwatch, for use by the HCP’s patients. The MSMS is designed to obtain inputs including heart rate, heart rate variability, audio, GPS location, accelerometer data, angular velocity, orientation, and number of steps. The MSMS then displays outputs of this patient data to the HCP on the HCP’s tablet prior to dosing and continuously over the course of the treatment session. The MSMS is intended to provide information in a consolidated manner to the HCP supervising the consciousness altering session, in either an inpatient or outpatient setting, to support their ability to monitor and decide when a patient may be safely discharged from a treatment session. Regulatory engagements with FDA for the progression of this regulated product took place throughout late 2021 and 2022 and are expected to continue as we advance the development of MSMS and other potential regulated digital medicine programs.
 Manufacturing & Supply
 MM-120 and MM-402 are small molecules isolated as stable crystalline solids. We believe the syntheses of these product candidates are reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale manufacturing. We expect to continue to identify and develop product candidates that are amenable to cost-effective manufacturing at the facilities of many third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations (“CDMOs”). Whenever possible, we seek to develop proprietary forms of active pharmaceutical ingredients and/or novel formulations which could provide enhancements in the pharmaceutical profile of our product candidates, including for instance improvements in the stability, manufacturability, pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics profile of our product candidates.
 We neither own nor operate, and currently have no plans to own or operate, any manufacturing facilities. We currently source all of our clinical and non-clinical drug substance and drug product supply through several CDMOs on a purchase order basis under master service and quality agreements. We have also sourced the proprietary formulations of our product candidates from CDMOs, and intend to source all of our future clinical supplies of our product candidates from CDMOs that comply with applicable cGMP.
All materials required for the production of these product candidates are currently manufactured by other CDMOs or suppliers. While we seek to enhance our market protection strategy by identifying unique and/or proprietary methods of manufacturing and/or dosage forms and entering into exclusive long-term or commercial supply agreements, we do not currently have arrangements in place for either long-term supply or redundant supply of drug substance or drug product for our research compounds and product candidates. We intend to enter into a scalable, long-term supply agreement at the appropriate time for drug substance and drug product for each product candidate, as and if clinical development of our product candidates continues. We plan to mitigate potential commercial supply risks for any products that are approved in the future through inventory management and through exploring additional manufacturers to provide drug substance or drug product.

Through our third-party manufacturers, we intend to refine and scale up the manufacturing process for our product candidates and manufacture clinical supplies as our development program progresses. We believe we currently have sufficient MM-120 drug substance for our ongoing trials and believe we will have access and steady supply of drug substance for our planned and future clinical trials.
Research and Development Collaborations
 We have entered into several license agreements with respect to our research and development activities, which are described below.
 University Hospital Basel - Liechti Lab Initiatives - Research Collaboration & Exclusive License
 On April 1, 2020, we entered into a multi-year, exclusive collaboration with Dr. Matthias Liechti’s lab at UHB, a leading pharmacology and clinical research group studying psychedelic substances based in Basel, Switzerland. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired exclusive worldwide rights to data, compounds, and patent rights associated with the UHB Liechti Lab’s research with lysergide and other psychedelic compounds, including data from preclinical studies and completed or ongoing clinical trials of lysergide and MDMA. Our ongoing research collaboration with the UHB Liechti Lab has generated a number of patent applications based on preclinical and clinical data.
 We support ongoing and planned research programs, as well as certain clinical trials under the direction of Dr. Liechti. Dr. Liechti, as principal investigator, has primary responsibility for the research studies of the selected compounds. Subject to certain terms and conditions, we provide research funding and certain milestone payments in return for the exclusive license to existing and future data and intellectual property generated from clinical trials. Subject to terms and conditions, UHB Liechti Lab may receive royalties and development revenue on any commercially marketed products developed through the collaboration.
 MDMA Research
 The UHB Liechti Lab has led multiple clinical trials investigating the safety and pharmacodynamics of MDMA. The cumulative data from the research conducted by the UHB Liechti Lab helps inform the design of our sponsored clinical trials and the assessment of development opportunities for MDMA or its derivatives as potential future development programs. We also continue to fund the UHB Liechti Lab's early-stage research activities aimed at exploring next-generation product candidates based on MDMA.
 DMT Research
 We are also funding the UHB Liechti Lab's research on DMT, a short-acting serotonergic tryptamine of the psychedelic drug class. This includes a Phase 1 randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, five-period crossover trial in 30 healthy volunteers assessing various intravenous dosing regimens of DMT that was completed in late 2022. In order to potentially induce a stable DMT experience lasting one to two hours, various intravenous dosing regimens, including a starting dose and then a maintenance dose, were evaluated in this Phase 1 IIT. Results from this investigator-initiated study are anticipated to be published in 2023.
 The human safety data and associated know-how gathered in this Phase 1 investigator-initiated trial will better enable our clinical team to design future potential product development programs based on DMT and could pave the way for future clinical trials of DMT or a derivative.
 Ketanserin Research
 We also funded a Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, random-order, two-period crossover clinical trial evaluating the effects of ketanserin on the acute response to lysergide in healthy subjects. This study intended to provide insights into the pharmacological activity of lysergide and the potential interaction between lysergide and co-administration with serotonin receptor antagonists. Results from this investigator-initiated study were published in November 2022 in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology and demonstrated the potential of ketanserin to shorten and attenuate the perceptual effects of lysergide
Lysergide Research
 Through our broad research collaboration with the UHB Liechti Lab, we have acquired exclusive rights to a body of historical and ongoing clinical trials assessing the clinical activity of lysergide in several brain health disorders including anxiety, depression and cluster headaches.
 In December 2021, the UHB Liechti Lab completed an investigator-initiated trial assessing the efficacy of 200 micrograms lysergide (two doses) versus a placebo on anxiety and depression symptoms in 46 patients with clinically significant anxiety. The UHB Licheti

Lab published the results from the study in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Biological Psychiatry in September 2022. Topline results demonstrated the significant, rapid, durable, and beneficial effects of lysergide and its potential to mitigate symptoms of anxiety and depression with an acceptable tolerability profile.
 We also supported a Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial evaluating lysergide for the treatment of MDD. The study evaluated the potential effects of two doses of lysergide (100 micrograms followed by 200 micrograms, separated by 4 weeks) on depression symptoms compared to a low dose of lysergide (25 microgram, two doses) in the control group. The study was completed in the second half of 2022 with topline results anticipated to be published in 2023.
 Additionally, in the area of neurology, we are supporting a Phase 2 investigator-initiated trial evaluating the effects of lysergide to mitigate the signs and symptoms of cluster headaches in patients. Cluster headaches are a relatively uncommon primary headache disorder that are considered to be among the most severe forms of pain. The study began recruiting patients in early 2019 and is planned to be completed by the end of 2023.
Personalized Medicine Technology Research
 We are also collaborating with the UHB Liechti Lab to research and develop technologies and analytics that seek to personalize psychedelic therapy treatment. One such research effort aims to better characterize the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that impact administration of MDMA, lysergide and other psychedelic compounds based on individual characteristics including age, gender, pharmacogenetics, personality traits, moods, metabolic markers and therapeutic drug monitoring. Through this collaborative research, we are seeking to advance our understanding of methods to predict and personalize the delivery of these compounds to enhance patient outcomes.
 MindShift Compounds AG Initiatives
 In February 2021, we entered into a partnership agreement with MindShift Compounds AG to develop and patent a portfolio of compounds, both with and without perceptual effects, related to the phenethylamine, tryptamine, and ergoline chemical classes. The objective of this partnership is to discover pharmaceutically optimized research compounds and product candidates. Drug discovery and synthesis activities by MindShift Compounds AG are ongoing and related patent applications have been and continue to be filed by us.
All intellectual property and pharmaceutical technology related to the synthesis processes developed through the collaboration are owned outright by us, and MindShift Compounds AG will provide all intellectual property related to the new psychedelic compounds exclusively to us.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary know-how and technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and CROs, when feasible, to enter into agreements that generally require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants, and CROs in the course of their service to us. On occasion, we also enter into research and development agreements with CDMOs in which certain intellectual property is shared jointly with CDMOs.
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to compositions, methods of use, treatment and patient selection, formulations and manufacturing processes created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection, and endeavor to promptly file patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions.
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing, or may in the future pursue, will issue as patents

in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will be enforceable or provide sufficient protection from competitors.
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by our issued patents, our pending patent applications or of patent applications we may file in the future. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S. PTO”), or similar proceedings outside the United States, to determine priority of invention.
 Patent Strategy and Applications
 Our patent strategy includes pursuing protection for compositions of matter, methods of treatment, and diagnostic devices and analytics related to psychedelics. Our patent portfolio includes 26 pending U.S. applications, and 12 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) applications. Additionally, we plan to aggressively pursue patents in diagnostics with patient monitoring and analytics.
 We hold pending patent applications in the United States and also under PCT. Our intellectual property holdings include, but are not limited to:
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering compositions and methods of treating an individual with a psychedelic drug and reducing acute effects. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering methods of dosing and treating patients with a psychedelic with specific doses. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications relating to lysergide covering methods of treatment, analytical methods, compositions of matter, and dosage formulations. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041 and 2042.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering a method of enhancing positive effects of a psychedelic. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications relating to MDMA covering methods of dosing MDMA in treating patients, methods of reducing adverse effects, and compositions of matter. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering methods of treatment with DMT. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering analytical methods with psilocybin. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2041.
 •Provisional applications relating to psilocin covering compositions of matter and methods of treatment.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering mescaline derivatives, and methods of treatment with mescaline and mescaline derivatives If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2042.
 •U.S. and PCT applications covering compositions of matter and methods of treatment with 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) salt. If granted, patents based on these applications have a projected expiry date in 2040. Provisional applications covering methods of treatment with various psychedelics.
 •Provisional applications covering systems and methods for monitoring patients and analyzing mental state.
 
Patent Term
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the U.S. PTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.


The term of a U.S. patent may also be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, also have patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extension on patents covering those products, their methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture.
 Trade Secrets
 In addition to patents, we may rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. Companies typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of their business that are not amenable to, or that they do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets, if any, and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, and, where feasible, with consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and certain other entities with whom we do business. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship. These agreements also generally provide that all relevant inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, designed to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties.
Competition
 The biopharmaceuticals industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. It is probable that the number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies similar to our products will increase.
 Our most advanced development candidate, MM-120, is in Phase 2b development for GAD and in Phase 2a development for ADHD. Patients with GAD are typically treated with a variety of anxiolytic and antidepressant medications, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines. If successfully developed and approved, MM-120 may also face competition from esketamine, which is approved in the treatment of treatment resistant depression and from ketamine which is not approved but whose off-label use is rapidly growing. A number of companies are developing product candidates intended for the treatment of GAD, including CYB004 (a serotonin receptor agonist) being developed by Cybin Inc. and zuranolone (a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor) which is being developed by Sage Therapeutics, Inc. In addition, ATAI Life Sciences N.V. is currently studying deuterated etifoxine (GRX-917), the non-deuterated form of which has been commercially available in France for the treatment of GAD since 1979. Patients with ADHD are generally treated with behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapies, combination treatments, school-based interventions, social skills training, and psychotherapies. Currently available pharmacotherapies include psychostimulants, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and alpha-2-adrenergic antagonists. Each of these available therapies could represent competition for MM-120 if it were to be approved for the treatment of ADHD.
 Among other organizations working on novel biopharmaceuticals focused on modulation of the serotonin and dopamine systems, we also face competition from a number of companies, including ATAI Life Sciences N.V, Compass Pathways plc, GH Research plc and others. ATAI Life Sciences N.V is developing multiple product candidates that are in various phases of development for the treatment of psychiatric and substance use indications. Compass Pathways plc is developing COMP360 (a proprietary formulation of psilocybin) that is in Phase 3 clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression and is being studied in other psychiatric indications. GH Research plc is developing GH001, GH002 and GH003 that are in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for treatment-resistant depression. There are also many other public and private companies developing therapeutics from the psychedelic drug class at various stages of development.
 Our other lead product candidate, MM-402, an enantiomer of MDMA with selective serotonergic activity, is in Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of core symptoms of ASD. If successfully developed and approved, MM-402 may face competition from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), which has a (+/-)-MDMA product candidate in clinical development for the treatment of social anxiety in the ASD population. MAPS also has a (+/-)-MDMA product candidate in Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Other companies are also developing serotonergic therapies for the treatment of ASD or related indications; For example, Nova Mentis Life Science Corp and Mycrodose Therapeutics Inc. are collaborating on a transdermal psilocybin product candidate for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome.


More broadly, numerous pharmaceutical companies are developing or partnering to develop pharmaceutical products targeting the treatment of brain health disorders. This includes companies such as Novartis AG, Roche, Pfizer Inc., Biogen Inc., Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sage Therapeutics, Inc. and Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Co. Ltd., among many others. Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. We expect competition in the indications we are pursuing will focus on efficacy, safety, convenience, availability, and price. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level, the UK, the EU, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring/pharmacovigilance, safety and periodic reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed in a given jurisdiction, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained and/or generated, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and the drug must be approved by the relevant regulatory authority or authorities.
U.S. Drug Development
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject a company to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s delay or refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold on a clinical investigation, warning or untitled letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and generally involves the following:
 •Completion of extensive nonclinical studies and testing, in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”), regulations;
 •Submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •Approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee representing each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
 •Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND and other clinical trial-related regulations, collectively referred to as good clinical practice (“GCP”), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each proposed indication;
 •Submission to the FDA of an NDA for marketing approval of a new drug;
 •A determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept and file the NDA for review;
 •Satisfactory completion of a potential FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;


•Potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
 •Payment of applicable user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S.
 The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct development stages: nonclinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, the nonclinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal laws and regulations, including, for animal studies, the Animal Welfare Act and GLP. The sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND.
 An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted, but an IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocols for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials, including whether subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND on clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated.
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or to patients with the disease or condition being studied under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of, clinical trials, and are intended to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, safety, and well-being of study participants are protected. GCPs include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any given clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols describing, among other details, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants, and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Companies sponsoring the clinical trials, investigators, and IRBs also must comply with, as applicable, regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study patients, following the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and timely reporting of adverse events. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. Foreign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the U.S. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee and compliance with informed consent principles, and FDA is able to validate the data from the study through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
 Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three phases that may overlap, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.


•Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in patients afflicted with the target disease to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients afflicted with the target disease at multiple sites (typically from several hundred to several thousand subjects), and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended for drugs intended for chronic dosing to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, increased rates of serious suspected adverse events, or findings from other studies or from animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. Success in one phase does not mean that the results will be observed in subsequent phases. Each phase may involve multiple studies. If concerns arise about the safety of the product candidate, the FDA or other regulatory authorities can stop clinical trials by placing them on a “clinical hold” pending receipt of additional data, which can result in a delay or termination of a clinical development program. The sponsoring company, the FDA, or the IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial, and may recommend suspension of a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, we must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 NDA and FDA Review Process
 The results of nonclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be offered for sale in the U.S.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, the FDA may also issue a Written Request asking a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies related to a particular active moiety; if the sponsor agrees and meets certain requirements, the sponsor may be eligible to receive additional marketing exclusivity for its drug product containing such active moiety.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended ("PDUFA"), each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee, unless subject to a waiver. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.


The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to complete its initial review of an NDA and respond to the applicant within 10 months from the filing date for a standard NDA and, and within six months from the filing date for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and integrity of the data submitted in the NDA. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. For example, the advisory committee may recommend or the FDA may determine that a REMS program is necessary to ensure safe use of the product. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation process for an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or one or more additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, non-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such additional data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
 The FDA typically requires that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, and may condition the approval of the NDA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-marketing testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and/or efficacy and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if the FDA determines that a REMS is required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any limitations on approval, marketing or use for any of our products could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of those products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements if problems occur following launch, or if FDA determines that the product is no longer safe or effective.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has several programs that are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Fast Track designation and Breakthrough Therapy designation are two of these programs and apply to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Fast Track product at any time during the development of the product and may request the FDA to designate the drug as a Breakthrough Therapy based on preliminary clinical evidence which meet the criteria outlined in the FDA’s programs. Under the Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy expedited programs, the FDA may review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.


Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and offers a significant improvement in the safety and effectiveness of treatment, diagnosis or prevention compared to marketed products. Significant improvement may be shown by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting product reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months from the date of the NDA filing.
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if the product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening illness and provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments. Accelerated approval for a product means that it may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the drug, such as:
 •distribution restricted to certain facilities or physicians with special training or experience; or
 •distribution conditioned on the performance of specified medical procedures.
 
The limitations imposed would be commensurate with the specific safety concerns presented by the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Pediatric Trials
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ("PSP"), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from non-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. The FDA, if it learns of new information, may also request that the sponsor amend the initial PSP.
Post-marketing Requirements
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the product, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the Internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Any

distribution of prescription drug products and pharmaceutical samples must comply with the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act.
 FDA regulations also require that approved products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, administrative enforcement, warning or untitled letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil penalties or criminal prosecution, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
 Digital Therapeutics/Software as a Medical Device
 Software applications such as the digital therapeutics that we are developing may meet the definition of a medical device and be subject to FDA pre-market authorization, depending on their classification and software function. FDA has issued guidance and referenced international principles established by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum for the clinical evaluation of SaMD, which refers to software that is intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device. We expect that our digital therapeutics in development will be, for the purpose of FDA regulations, non-significant risk, Class I or Class II medical devices. Certain clinical decision support ("CDS"), software, is exempt from the definition of a medical device, or under FDA guidance, is subject to a policy of enforcement discretion.
 Other Regulatory Matters
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the U.S., the Department of Health and Human Services; the U.S. Department of Justice; the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”); the Consumer Product Safety Commission; the Federal Trade Commission; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the Environmental Protection Agency; and state and local governments.
 In the U.S., arrangements and interactions with healthcare professionals, third-party payors, patients and others will expose us to broadly applicable anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and other health care laws and regulations. These broadly applicable laws and regulations may constrain the business or financial arrangements or relationships through which we sell, market and distribute our approved product and any future products that may obtain marketing approval. In the U.S., federal and state health care laws and regulations that may affect our operations include:
 •The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a company marketing a prescription drug (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward the referral of an individual or purchase, lease or order, or the arranging for or recommending the purchase or order, of a particular item or service, for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical companies on one hand and prescribers, patients, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Liability under the Anti-Kickback Statute may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory 


safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration to those who prescribe, purchase, or recommend pharmaceutical and biological products, including certain discounts, or engaging such individuals as consultants, advisors, or speakers, may be subject to scrutiny if they do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, there are no safe harbors for many common practices, such as educational and research grants, charitable donations, product support and patient assistance. Violations of this law may be punishable by up to ten years in prison, criminal fines, damages, administrative civil money penalties, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 •The federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the federal government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Many pharmaceutical manufacturers have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper activities. The government may deem companies to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our activities relating to the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation may include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant civil penalties for each separate false or fraudulent claim, and the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
 •Numerous federal and state laws, including comprehensive data privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information and/or genetic privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act), govern the collection, storage, transfer, processing, generating, use, and disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Obligations related to data privacy and security are quickly changing, becoming increasingly stringent, and creating regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to differing applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources. These obligations may result in additional compliance burdens for our clinical trials and necessitate changes to our services, information technologies, systems, and practices. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability, private litigation, or adverse publicity. In addition, we or our collaborators may obtain health information from third parties, such as hospitals, healthcare professionals, and research institutions, that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and its implementing regulations (collectively, “HIPAA”). HIPAA imposes privacy and security obligations on covered entity HCPs, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their “business associates” – independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. Although we are not directly subject to the HIPAA information privacy and security provisions – other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits – we could potentially be subject to criminal penalties if we or our agents knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. In addition, HIPAA does not replace federal, state, or other laws that may grant individuals even greater privacy protection.
 
•The HIPAA fraud provisions, which impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 •The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the “CMS”), the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, information related to direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals and certain other HCPs (such as physicians assistants and nurse practitioners), as well as ownership and investment interests held in the company by physicians and their immediate family members.


•Analogous state and local laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, regardless of the payor. We also may become subject to other state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to HCPs; state laws that restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to clinical trials, or information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other HCPs or marketing expenditures; state laws and local ordinances that require identification or licensing of sales representatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 Substantial resources are necessary to ensure that our business arrangements and interactions with health care professionals, third party payors, patients and others comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law, and if we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, imprisonment, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business.
 Numerous other laws may apply to our products. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to herein as the "ACA"). If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Many states impose various requirements on pharmaceutical manufacturers to report development costs and pricing information when prices are increased. Penalties for late or faulty reporting can reach $10,000 per day. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
 The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the CSA and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act.
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, issuance of warning or untitled letters, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Federal regulators, state attorneys general, and plaintiffs’ attorneys have been and will likely continue to be active in this space. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way.
 Many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Many of the state laws enable a state attorney general to bring actions and provide private rights of action to consumers as enforcement mechanisms. There is also heightened sensitivity around certain types of health information, such as sensitive condition information or the health information of minors, which may be subject to additional protections. Compliance with these laws is difficult, constantly evolving, and time consuming. Changes in statutes, regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
 State Corporate Practice of Medicine Laws
 The corporate practice of medicine and other learned profession laws, regulations and doctrines, which are enforced by most states, are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing a physician’s or other medical professional’s professional judgment and prohibiting the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance could lead

to adverse judicial or administrative action against us, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of professional licenses, or a restructuring of our business arrangements with affiliated providers and our Centers of Excellence.
 U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our drug candidates, if any, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, or the testing phase, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, or the approval phase. This patent term restoration period may be reduced by the FDA if it finds that applicant did not act with due diligence during the testing phase or the approval phase. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. PTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if circumstances permit, we intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our then owned or licensed patents, if any, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. Even if, at the relevant time, we have a valid issued patent covering our product, we may not be granted an extension if we were, for example, to fail to apply within applicable deadlines, to fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise to fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, and we do not have any other exclusivity, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and our ability to generate revenues could be materially adversely affected.
 Some of our products may also be entitled to certain non-patent-related data exclusivity under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity(“NCE”). A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”), or a 505(b)(2) NDA may not be submitted by another company for another drug containing the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA Orange Book by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a full NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. Three-year exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications that rely on the information that served as the basis of granting three-year exclusivity. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations, and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the non-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy.
 European Union Drug Development
 In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our future products may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the U.S., medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities in the EU has been obtained.
 Similar to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (the "EU Clinical Trials Regulation"), introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results.
 In the EU, pediatric data or an approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”), or waiver, is required to have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), prior to submission of a marketing authorization application to the EMA or the competent authorities of the EU Member States. In some EU countries, we may also be required to have an approved PIP before we can begin enrolling pediatric patients in a clinical trial.


European Union Drug Review and Approval and Post-marketing Requirements
 In the EEA (which is comprised of 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related marketing authorization has been granted. Marketing authorization for medicinal products can be obtained through several different procedures. These are through a centralized, mutual recognition procedure, decentralized procedure, or national procedure (if marketing authorization is sought for a single EU Member State). The centralized procedure allows a company to submit a single application to the EMA. If a related positive opinion is provided by the EMA, the European Commission will grant a centralized marketing authorization that is valid in all EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Associations countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), all of whom make up the EEA.
 The EU centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance that is not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which grant of centralized marketing authorization is in the interest of patients in the EU.
 The decentralized authorization procedure permits companies to file identical applications for authorization to several EU Member States simultaneously for a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any EU Member State. The competent authorities of a single EU Member State, the reference member state, are appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. The competent authorities of the other EU Member States, the concerned member states, are subsequently required to grant marketing authorization for their territories on the basis of this assessment. The only exception to this is where an EU Member State considers that there are concerns of potential serious risk to public health related to authorization of the product. In these circumstances, the matter is submitted to the Heads of Medicines Agencies for review. The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States.
 The maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application in the EU is 210 days, not including clock stops during which applicants respond to questions from the competent authority. The initial marketing authorization granted in the EU is valid for five years. The authorization may be renewed and valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authority of an EU Member State or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities of the EU Member States or the EMA.
 The holder of an EU marketing authorization for a medicinal product must also comply with the EU’s pharmacovigilance legislation. This includes requirements to conduct pharmacovigilance, or the assessment and monitoring of the safety of medicinal products.
 Various requirements apply to the manufacturing and placing on the EU market of medicinal products. Manufacture of medicinal products in the EU requires a manufacturing authorization and import of medicinal products into the EU requires a manufacturing authorization allowing for import. The manufacturing authorization holder must comply with various requirements set out in the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”), including the manufacture of APIs outside of the EU with the intention to import the APIs into the EU. Similarly, the distribution of medicinal products within the EU is subject to compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidelines, including the requirement to hold appropriate authorizations for distribution granted by the competent authorities of the EU Member States. Marketing authorization holders and/or manufacturing authorization holders and/or distribution authorization holders may be subject to civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including suspension of manufacturing authorization, in case of non-compliance with the EU or EU Member States’ requirements applicable to the manufacturing of medicinal products.
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics (the “SmPC”), as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization approval. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. Breaches of the rules governing the promotion of medicinal products in the EU could be penalized by civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, which may include fines and imprisonment. These laws may further limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of medicinal products to healthcare professionals. Advertising of medicinal products that contain psychotropic and narcotic substances is in any case prohibited.

European Union Regulatory Data Exclusivity
 The EU legislation governing grant of marketing authorization for medicinal products provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon grant of marketing authorization in the EU, innovative medicinal products generally benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator's pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
European Union Medical Device Development, Approval and Marketing
 On May 26, 2021, the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on Medical Devices (the “MDR”) entered into application, repealing and replacing both the Medical Devices Directive, and the Active Implantable Medical Devices. The MDR and its associated guidance documents and harmonized standards govern, among other things, device design and development, preclinical and clinical or performance testing, premarket conformity assessment, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, claims, sales and distribution, export and import and post-market surveillance, vigilance, and market surveillance. Medical devices including SaMD must comply with the General Safety and Performance Requirements (“GSPRs”) set out in Annex I of the MDR. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to devices, including SaMD, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the GSPRs provided in the MDR and obtain the right to affix the CE mark, medical devices manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Apart from low-risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), in relation to which the manufacturer may issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the GSPRs, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by a Competent Authority of an EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body audits and examines the technical documentation and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the medical devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity (the “Certificate”) following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the GSPRs. This Certificate and the related conformity assessment process entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.
As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the GSPRs must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use and that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device (e.g., product labeling and instructions for use) are supported by suitable evidence. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (1) clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed, (2) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated or (3) both clinical studies and scientific literature. The conduct of clinical studies in the EEA is governed by detailed regulatory obligations. These may include the requirement of prior authorization by the Competent Authorities of the country in which the study takes place and the requirement to obtain a positive opinion from a competent Ethics Committee. This process can be expensive and time-consuming. After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements.
 The MDR sets out the regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU. The Competent Authorities of each EU Member State oversee the implementation of the MDR within their jurisdiction. Devices are classified in accordance with their perceived risks in a manner similar to the United States risk classification system. Before a medical device can be marketed in the EU it must undergo a conformity assessment procedure after which the manufacturer may affix the CE mark on the devices. The class of a product determines the conformity assessment required before the CE mark can be placed on a product. Once the Notified Body has issued a Certificate of Conformity, the manufacturer has drawn up the Declaration of Conformity and affixed the CE mark the device can be sold throughout the European Union. The MDR also imposes post-marketing requirements including among others market surveillance. Certain of our product candidates are designed to be delivered to patients by dedicated medical devices. In the EU, products that are a combination of a medicinal product and a medical device are regulated as either a medicinal product or a medical device, depending on which component has the primary mode of action.
 Medical devices that incorporate a medicinal product as an integral part that has an action ancillary to the action of the medical device are regulated as medical devices in accordance with the MDR. However, the quality, safety and usefulness of the medicinal

product must also be verified as part of the device and a scientific opinion from a national competent authority of an EU Member State or from the EMA, depending on its nature and therapeutic intention, must be sought regarding the quality and safety of the medicinal product, including the benefit or risk of its incorporation into the medical device. Where a medical device incorporates a medicinal product as an integral part as a single use drug delivery system, it is regulated as a medicinal product. In this case, the relevant General Safety and Performance Requirements, or GSPRs of the MDR will apply to the safety and performance of the device element.
Regulation of Medicinal Products and Medical Devices following the UK’s Exit from the EU
 The UK’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the “MHRA”) is now the UK’s standalone regulator. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the “EU-UK Agreement”). The EU-UK Agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods, including medicinal products. Although the body of the EU-UK Agreement includes general terms which apply to medicinal products, greater detail on sector-specific issues is provided in an Annex to the EU-UK Agreement.
 Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) will be treated as a third country. Northern Ireland will, with regard to EU regulations, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. As part of the EU-UK Agreement, the EU and the UK will recognize cGMP inspections carried out by the other party and the acceptance of official cGMP documents issued by the other party. The EU-UK Agreement also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The UK has unilaterally agreed to accept EU batch testing and batch release for a period of at least two years until January 1, 2024. However, the EU continues to apply EU laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the EU territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the UK must be retested and re-released when entering the EU market for commercial use.
The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation). However, it is currently unclear to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU following entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation last year on January 31, 2022.
As regards marketing authorizations, Great Britain has a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a national marketing authorization. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the European Commission. Since January 1, 2021, an applicant for a centralized procedure marketing authorization can no longer be established in the UK. Since this date, companies established in the UK cannot use the centralized procedure and instead must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures to obtain a marketing authorization to market products in the UK. For a three year period from January 1, 2021, MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new centralized procedure marketing authorization when determining an application for a Great Britain marketing authorization; or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States to be granted in Great Britain. Post Brexit, the MHRA has been updating various aspects of the regulatory regime for medicinal products in the UK.
 Regarding medical devices, the MDR entered into application in the EU. However, the MDR is not applicable in the UK. In the UK, MDs are governed by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) (UK MDR 2002) which retains a regulatory framework similar to the framework set out by the MDD. As a result, there will be some regulatory divergence in the UK from the EU.
In light of the fact, that the CE marking process is set out in EU law, which no longer applies in the UK, the UK has devised a new route to market culminating in a UK Conformity Assessed ("UKCA") mark to replace the CE Mark for medical devices on the market in Great Britain (GB). Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the regulations governing CE Marks (a CE Mark or a CE Mark and UKCA mark will be required to place products on the Northern Ireland market). CE Marks will in principle continue to be recognized in Great Britain for medical devices until June 30, 2024, however all medical devices must be registered with the MHRA, in order to be placed on the Great Britain market. The EU legal framework remains applicable in Northern Ireland (any products placed on the market in the NI must be compliant with EU law). The nature of any new regulation in the UK is uncertain, and as such, we may experience delays in obtaining future access to the UK. and other European markets. The UK’s departure from the EU has also impacted customs regulations and impacted timing and easy of shipments into the EU from the UK.
European Union Data Protection
 EU Member States and other jurisdictions where we may in the future operate have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”), which

became operative on May 25, 2018, replacing the EU Data Protection Directive, imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. Data Protection Authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the GDPR and applicable related national laws differently and impose requirements additional to those provided in the GDPR. In addition, guidance on implementation and compliance practices may be updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EEA. We may face fines or regulatory action if we violate the EU GDPR. For example, under the EU GDPR, companies may face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests.
 Europe and other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal data to other countries. In particular, the EEA and the UK have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States and other countries whose privacy laws it believes are inadequate. Mechanisms to allow for the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. are subject to legal challenges. The most common, currently authorized procedure to transfer personal data out of the EU, the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) may come under increased scrutiny. Following the European Court of Justice’s ruling, the European Data Protection Board issued a statement providing among other things that it is a primary responsibility of the exporter and the importer, when considering whether to rely on Standard Contractual Clauses to export data from the EU to third countries, to ensure that these third countries maintain a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to that guaranteed by the GDPR in light of the EU Charter of Human Rights. Companies may need to revise their Standard Contractual Clauses in light of the July 16, 2020 judgement. Companies that have not taken steps to demonstrate that their Standard Contractual Clauses and personal data recipients in the U.S. are suitable to transfer to receive the personal data may be subject to enforcement actions by competent authorities in the EU for failure to comply with related data privacy rules.
 The GDPR has introduced additional data protection obligations that can have specific impact on the conduct of clinical trials in the EEA. This includes obligations concerning the rights of patients in relation to their personal data collected during the clinical trials and the need to conclude arrangements with clinical trials sites concerning data processing activities.
 Rest of the World Regulation
 For other countries outside of the U.S. and EU, such as certain countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 Approval by a regulatory authority in one jurisdiction does not guarantee approval by comparable regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements applicable to a given country, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in such country if we choose to seek such approval, or we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.


Coverage and Reimbursement
 U.S. Healthcare Reform
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to President Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the Inflation Reduction Act (the "IRA"), among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to submit a report within 90 days on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control costs of pharmaceutical and biological products. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. We expect that the healthcare reform measures that have been adopted, and that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria for healthcare products and services, which could result in additional downward pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
 Any product candidates we successfully commercialize, if approved, in the future depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce healthcare practitioner usage of our products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In the U.S., HCPs are reimbursed for covered services and products through Medicare, Medicaid, and other government healthcare programs, as well as through commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the EU provides options for the EU Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product, or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States), can further reduce prices.
The Health Technology Assessment (“HTA Regulation”), which is currently governed by the national laws of the individual EU Member States, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of the HTA Regulation regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted

to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technologies assessment. The proposed regulation is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. In December 2021 the HTA Regulation was adopted and entered into force on January 11, 2022. It will apply from 2025.
 In various EU Member States, we expect to be subject to continuous cost-cutting measures, such as lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative.
 Controlled Substances
 The federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (the “CSA”), and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of regulations for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements in order to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
 The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules—Schedule I, II, III, IV or V—with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use that are otherwise approved for marketing may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence.
 Facilities that manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substance schedule(s).
 The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, recordkeeping, reporting and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must obtain authorization to destroy or dispose of controlled substances. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance or Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non-narcotics. In some cases, Schedule III non-narcotic substances may be subject to the import/export permit requirement, if necessary, to ensure that the United States complies with its obligations under international drug control treaties.
 For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
 The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State authorities, including boards of pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.

Legislation adopted at EU level in relation to establishment of different classes of substances is limited to the EU Regulations that define classes of precursors. These are Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on drug precursors, amended by Regulation (EU) No 1258/2013, which regulates intra-Community trade and the Council Regulation (EC) No 111/2005 of 22 December 2004 laying down rules for the monitoring of trade between the Community and third countries in drug precursors, amended by Regulation (EU) No 1259/2013. While EU legislation does not establish different classes of narcotic or psychotropic substances, the EU has a pan-European system to rapidly detect, assess and respond to health and social threats caused by NPS, under the procedures set out in the Regulation (EU) 2017/2101.
 In the EU, controlled substances are largely governed by the national law of the individual EU Member States. EU Member States classify medicinal products and precursors according to the three UN Conventions of 1961, 1971 and 1988 controlling and supervising their legitimate scientific or medical use while taking into account the particular risks to public or individual health. It is within the competence of individual EU Member States to decide whether or not to add a specific substance to a Schedule. EU Member States may require entities and persons to obtain a national license to manufacture, import, export, distribute or offer a substance that has been added to a schedule of controlled substances. The related approach may differ from EU Member State to EU Member State. In the UK, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and its subsequent amendments are the main legal framework for regulating controlled substances. The Act sets out the specific offenses related to the possession, supply, and production of controlled substances, as well as outlines the penalties that can be imposed for such offenses.
 At the international level, the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances are the primary legal instrument governing the control of controlled substances. The Convention requires States to adopt measures to prevent the misuse of controlled substances and also outlines the penalties to be imposed for the possession or supply of controlled substances in four Schedules. Additionally, the Convention sets out the criteria for classifying controlled substances, and the process for their international trade.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) also plays an important role in regulating controlled substances through its Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD). The ECDD is responsible for assessing the risks and benefits of controlled substances and making recommendations to the WHO on their scheduling. The WHO publishes a regularly updated list of controlled substances, which includes their classification and international trade regulations.
These regulatory frameworks, and any changes to them, can introduce additional risks by making it difficult for manufacturers to access the substances they need to produce their products, and also makes them vulnerable to the risks of non-compliance with the regulations, which can further complicate the process of transporting, importing and exporting controlled substances.
