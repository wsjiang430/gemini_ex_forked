Item 1. Business.
 
Business Introduction/Summary
 
References herein to “we,” “us,” “Sunworks,” and “the Company” are to Sunworks, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Sunworks United Inc. (“Sunworks United”), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Solcius, LLC (“Solcius”) and Commercial Solar Energy Inc. (“CSE”).
 
We provide photovoltaic (“PV”) and battery based power and storage systems for the residential and commercial markets. Commercial projects include commercial, agricultural, industrial and public works projects.
 
We were originally incorporated in Delaware on January 30, 2002 as MachineTalker, Inc. In July 2010, we changed our company name to Solar3D, Inc. On January 31, 2014, we acquired 100% of the stock of Solar United Network, Inc., a California corporation. On March 2, 2015, we acquired MD Energy. On December 1, 2015, we acquired Plan B through a merger of Plan B Enterprises, Inc. into our wholly owned subsidiary, Elite Solar Acquisition Sub., Inc. On March 1, 2016 we changed our name to Sunworks, Inc. with simultaneous Nasdaq stock symbol change from SLTD to SUNW.
 
On April 8, 2021, Sunworks, Inc., through its operating subsidiary Sunworks United (the “Buyer”), acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the “Acquisition”) of Solcius, from Solcius Holdings, LLC (“Seller”). Located in Provo, Utah, Solcius is a full-service, residential solar systems provider. The transaction creates a national solar power provider with a presence now in 15 states, including California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and South Carolina. We believe the transaction enhances economies of scale, leading to better access to suppliers, vendors and financial partners, as well as marketing and customer acquisition opportunities.
 
The Acquisition was consummated on April 8, 2021 pursuant to a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 8, 2021 (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and between Buyer and Seller. The purchase price for Solcius consisted of $51.75 million in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments related to working capital, cash, indebtedness and transaction expenses.
 
Residential Solar
 
Through our Solcius operating subsidiary, we design, arrange financing, integrate, install, and manage systems, primarily for residential homeowners. We sell residential solar systems through multiple channels, through our network of sales channel partners as well as a growing direct sales channel strategy. We have direct sales and/or operations personnel and operate in several residential markets including California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and South Carolina. Minnesota.
Commercial Solar Energy
 
Through our Commercial Solar Energy “CSE” subsidiary, we design, arrange financing, integrate, install, and manage systems ranging in size from 50kW (kilowatt) to multi-MW (megawatt) systems primarily for larger commercial and public works projects. Commercial installations have included installations at office buildings, manufacturing plants, warehouses, service stations, churches, and agricultural facilities such as farms, wineries, and dairies. Public works installations have included school districts, local municipalities, federal facilities and higher education institutions. Historically, the CSE subsidiary participated in the California Residential solar market. Following the Solcius Acquisition, all new residential sales are managed under the Solcius brand. Due to materiality, the Company reported the remaining revenue of legacy residential projects in the Commercial Solar Energy segment. CSE primarily operates in California.

Company Strategy
 
We intend to capitalize on the growth outlook for commercial and residential solar markets in North America. Our strategic objectives include the following, of which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are, and potentially will be, exacerbated by any negative economic downturn:

○ | Capitalize on industry growth. Over the last decade, solar power has become the lowest cost new energy generation source as the industry matured and as technology has evolved. With solar, both residential and commercial customers can realize short pay back periods and can reduce their exposure to traditional energy sources. Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) considerations are factored into customer buying patterns, as consumers want less reliance on grid participation are becoming more focused on renewable forms of energy generation. Additionally, the current regulatory environment is generally positive, as the Biden administration continues to pursue incentives directed to clean energy generation, most notably, passing the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. As a result, the solar industry is expected to grow at a rapid rate and become a significant source of new power generation, displacing some carbon-based alternatives.

○ | Increase the velocity of installation. We believe a reduction in the time required to install a residential solar installation improves both pricing power with third-party channel relationships and customer retention. Beginning in 2022, we decentralized all design, permitting and scheduling activities to local and regional Company hubs, while continuing to leverage the benefits of scale across shared services. We will continue to utilize lean principles and practices to optimize workflow and improve installation timelines. 
○ | Expand cost-efficient direct sales channel. We have embarked on a multi-year initiative to develop a robust, direct sales team designed to complement our third-party channel partners. This direct sales team is incentivized to develop business across the residential markets where we operate, with an emphasis on rooftop solar installations. In 2022, the direct sales team was responsible approximately 20% of total residential installation revenue, versus approximately 5% in the prior year. 
○ | Drive efficient sourcing and procurement. We intend to shift an increased proportion of our sourcing away from foreign, third-party distribution channels toward U.S. based original equipment manufacturers, an approach that will allow for improved surety of supply. By year-end 2024, we intend to source a significant share of our panel and component inventory from U.S. based producers, whereas no materials are currently sourced domestically. During 2022, we grew total inventory by $16.2 million thereby ensuring product availability during a period of elevated customer demand. 
○ | Drive sustained margin expansion. We believe key drivers of margin expansion include programmatic price increases; market share gains in both our core California commercial market and new geographic regions; reductions in lead times; optimization of our sales channel partner network; an increased mix of revenue derived from our direct sales force; increased productivity resulting from recent headcount investments; and the adoption of lean principles to reduce cost and drive continuous improvement. Over time, we expect to achieve improved margin realization, as recent performance improvement initiatives are further implemented.

Company Operations
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 625 employees of which 622 were full-time employees with 2 of those employees on temporary layoff, medical, family or disability leave. We also utilize outside subcontractors to assist with installing commercial solar systems for our commercial customers. Our direct installation labor is a combination of employees and contract labor.
Sales and Marketing
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 142 employees primarily focused on sales, sales support and marketing, compared to approximately 35 employees as of December 31, 2021.
 
We are adding to our in-house direct residential sales force and marketing capabilities while we continue to partner with authorized dealers and select third-party sales originators. Reducing our residential customer acquisition costs and managing the customer experience throughout the process of sales and installation is part of our goal to minimize the fixed costs and financial risk of customer acquisition while improving the entire customer experience.
 
We believe we have an advantage in the commercial solar market given our extensive contact list, resulting from our experience in the construction market, which provides access to customers. Through our network of vendors, participation in a variety of industry trade associations and independent sales consultants, we now have a growing list of repeat clients, as well as an active and loyal referral network.
 
Financing
 
To promote sales, we assist customers in obtaining financing through our network of lenders that offer leases, loans or Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”). A PPA is a contract between two parties, one which generates electricity and the other purchases the electricity. The Company believes that offering a variety of financing options to its sales channels and end-customers promotes differentiation and enables solar adoption. The Company expanded its financing partner relationships in 2022 and will continue to do so in the future, as financing products evolve.
Suppliers
 
We purchase solar panels, inverters, batteries and materials from multiple manufacturers both directly and through distributors. We intend to further coordinate purchases and optimize supply relationships to realize advantages of greater scale. If one or more of our suppliers fail to meet our anticipated demand, ceases or reduces production due to its financial condition, acquisition by a competitor or otherwise, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or to qualify alternative products on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy this demand may be adversely affected. We do not, however, rely on any single supplier and, we believe, we can obtain needed solar panels and materials from a variety of different suppliers. Accordingly, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not materially affect our business.
 
We also utilize strategic partnerships with subcontractors for carport construction, and electrical installations, for racking and solar panel installations, as well as subcontractors for roofing, grading, landscaping, and construction for our larger commercial projects.

Installation
 
We are a licensed contractor in the markets we serve, and we are responsible for every customer installation. We manage the entire process from permitting through inspection to interconnection to the power grid, thereby making the system installation process simpler and as seamless as possible for our customers. Controlling every aspect of the installation process allows us to minimize costs, ensure quality and deliver high levels of customer satisfaction.
 
Even with controlling every aspect of the installation process, the ability to perform on a contract is subject to limitations. Jurisdictional approval processes are outside of our immediate control including, but not limited to, approval processes required by cities, counties, states or the federal government or one of their agencies. Other aspects outside of our direct control include approvals from various utility companies and weather conditions.
 
After-Sales Support
 
We offer continuing operational and maintenance services for our installed residential and commercial PV systems by providing extended factory equipment technical support and acting as a service liaison using our proprietary knowledge, technology, and solar electric energy and battery system qualified engineering and technical staff. We do this through a Limited Workmanship Warranty and Operations and Maintenance Program, which among other things provides a service and technical support line to our customers. We generally respond to our job site related issues within 24 hours. We strive to offer assistance for residential installations as long as required to maintain customer satisfaction. For commercial customers we offer separate operation, maintenance and monitoring contracts. These operation, maintenance and monitoring contracts generally have terms ranging from 5 to 25 years.
 
Facilities
 
We maintain sales and installation offices in Roseville, Sacramento, Morgan Hill, Durham, Tulare, Santa Ana and Riverside, California. We also maintain sales and installation offices in Provo and St. George, Utah; Phoenix, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; Centennial, Colorado; El Paso, Mesquite and McAllen, Texas; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Bloomingdale, Minnesota; Columbia, South Carolina; and Mequon, Wisconsin. We lease all of our offices and facilities.
 
Customers
 
Approximately 88% of our 2022 revenue came from residential installations while residential revenue was 77% of total revenue in 2021. The increase in residential revenue as a percentage of total revenue is the result of the Solcius Acquisition in April 2021 and its inclusion for the full year of 2022. Approximately 12% of our total revenue in 2022 came from commercial installations, down from 23% in 2021.
 
Our residential operations address the needs of property owners by installing systems typically smaller than 20kW. We facilitate purchase or lease financing and offer multiple product options to fit the specific needs of each customer.
 
We install systems for the commercial market and for public works projects. We define small commercial and public works projects as the installation of systems under 100kW, whereas large projects involve the installation of systems greater than 100kW. Solar projects have received limited financing from traditional lending sources, but we are encouraged by municipal PACE programs in California which have drawn funding sources such as Ygrene Energy Fund into the financing of energy projects. Public works projects are frequently financed through various PPA arrangements, often in conjunction with SPURR (School Project for Utility Rate Reduction) programs, a Joint Powers Authority in California. Cycle times vary from twenty weeks to more than a year, depending on customer specifications, supply chain, permitting and engineering lead times. Agricultural system sizes vary significantly within this sector and can range from 10kW to multiple megawatts. Agricultural loans to farmers and tax-oriented leases are the primary funding sources within the industry. Similar to commercial installations, cycle times for agricultural projects may commonly range from a few months to more than three years depending upon the authority having jurisdiction, the existing utility infrastructure and the various approvals required.

Competitors
 
In the solar installation market, we compete with companies that offer products similar to ours. Some of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience, and technical capabilities than we do. When bidding for solar installation projects, however, our current experience suggests that there is no clear dominant or preferred competitor in the markets in which we compete. We do not believe that any competitor has more than 10% of the market across all the areas in which we operate. We compete with other solar installers on pricing, service, warranty, and the ability to arrange financing. On a global scale, we also compete, on a cost basis, with traditional utilities that supply electricity to our potential customers and with companies that are not regulated like traditional utilities but that have access to the traditional utility electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure pursuant to state and local pro-competitive and consumer choice policies. Our advantage over traditional utilities is that we offer customers the opportunity to create their own electricity and reduce dependency from the traditional electrical grid.
Seasonality
 
Our revenue is impacted by seasonal weather patterns. In addition, some customers prefer to complete projects by the end of a calendar year to realize the benefits of available subsidy programs prior to year-end.
Technology and Intellectual Property
 
Generally, the solar installation business is not dependent on intellectual property. Within our residential business, we utilize proprietary software, which enables our sales channel partners to efficiently manage the sales process and allows our operations team to manage thousands of installations annually.
Government Regulation and Incentives
 
Government Regulation
 
We are not regulated as a public utility within the United States under applicable national, state or other local regulatory regimes where we conduct business.
 
To operate our systems, we obtain interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on the size of the solar energy system and local law requirements, interconnection permission is provided by the local utility to us or our customer. In almost all cases, interconnection permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over net energy metering procedures. As such, no additional regulatory approvals are required once interconnection permission is given.
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws, including regulations governing the occupational health and safety of our employees and wage regulations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the federal and California Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), and comparable state laws that protect and regulate employee health and safety.
 
Federal, state and local government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. These incentives enable us to lower the price we charge customers to own or lease our solar energy systems, helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.

Inflation Reduction Act
 
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) into law. This legislative package includes major policy initiatives across multiple industries from healthcare to clean energy. It is particularly focused on carbon reduction and replacing reliance on fossil fuels in the U.S., providing long-term tax credits and incentives for a myriad of renewable energy and electrification technologies.
 
For the US solar industry, the passage of this legislation gives the industry the most long-term certainty for federal tax credits it has ever had. Assuming no significant changes to the IRA, the industry should have ten years of certainty between the extensions of the current investment tax credit (ITC) and production tax credit (PTC), in addition to a new technology-neutral tax credit that begins after 2024. This stands in stark contrast to the one-, two-, or five-year extensions of the last decade that have typically been passed in the final days of the year.
 
Equally as important, key provisions of the Solar Energy Manufacturing for America Act (SEMA) were included in the IRA, which means, for the first time, the US solar industry will have access to production tax credits and an investment tax credit for domestic manufacturing across the solar value chain. Multiple companies have already announced commitments to build new domestic facilities, which will diversify and bolster the US solar supply chain over the long term.
 
The IRA extends the provisions of the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) which allows residential homeowners who install designated solar energy systems between January 1, 2022, through the end of 2032, to receive a tax credit of 30% of the cost from their federal income taxes. If owners owe less than that amount in federal taxes for the year they install their solar system, they can carry over any unused credit for as long as the ITC is in effect, January 1, 2032. After 2032, the residential ITC will start to phase out to 26% in 2033, 22% in 2034, and will end in 2035 unless Congress renews the provisions. The base commercial project ITC rate is 30%. To claim the ITC, solar developers and their sub-contractors must use union labor or prevailing wages during construction and the first five years of operations
 
The IRA also enhances the ITC for certain projects placed into service after December 31, 2022. In the case of the PTC, the credit can increase if the solar projects meet certain requirements. The IRA also created the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (Section 45X), which provides for an additional 10% increase in the ITC if  a project uses domestically produced materials and the total materials for the project are at least 40% U.S.-made.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Congress may take action to change or eliminate portions of the IRA, which could adversely affect our business by reducing or eliminating the incentives or credits set forth in the IRA, as signed into law last year.
 
NEM 3.0 Update
 
Net Energy Metering (NEM) is utilized in California to allow consumers to participate in transmitting solar power generated from their systems and selling the power back to the grid. This benefit has allowed consumers to improve the economics of their investment in solar by lowering the consumers overall energy bill and shortening the payback period. In December 2022, the California Public Utility Commission issued a final decision on NEM 3.0, which would degrade economics of residential and commercial solar projects by lowering the export rate by 75%, a key benefit of solar. While the reduction in export rate is significant, the cost of solar relative to current electricity bills and the expected inflationary pressures on future utility rates is likely to continue to make solar economical. Additionally, homeowners may augment their solar systems with batteries, to ensure that excess power generated during the day is exported to the grid during peak pricing times.

Anti-Circumvention Investigation Update
 
On March 28, 2022, the Department of Commerce (DOC) announced it would initiate an anti-circumvention investigation of Chinese anti-dumping and countervailing duties (AD/CVD) for solar cells and modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This investigation (referred to throughout as the anti-circumvention investigation) was initiated by a petition submitted in February 2022 by California-based module manufacturer Auxin Solar. The petition alleges that solar cell and module manufacturers are circumventing existing AD/CVD tariffs that apply to Chinese imports by manufacturing solar cells and modules in the four named countries using raw inputs from China. In June 2022, the Biden Administration implemented a 24-month moratorium on any anti-circumvention duties that Commerce decides later this summer to impose on solar cells and panels imported from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia. Module manufacturers from the impacted countries have since reopened plants and are likely to regain full production by the end of 2023. In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce published its preliminary determination that certain manufacturers of solar energy products in Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia that rely on Chinese-origin inputs are circumventing U.S. antidumping and countervailing duties relating to crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules of Chinese origin. Assuming the results of Commerce’s preliminary findings are upheld in the final determination, once the Biden Administration’s two-year tariff waiver for covered goods coming from Southeast Asia expires in June 2024, manufacturers of solar energy products in Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia will be required to pay AD/CVD duties on most imports of solar energy products from these countries. None of our existing supply chain was impacted by this decision, as our key suppliers were not found to be circumventing existing tariffs.
 
Approximately 50% of U.S. states offer a personal or corporate investment or production tax credit for solar energy that is additive to the ITC. Further, these states, and many local jurisdictions, have established property tax incentives for renewable energy systems that include exemptions, exclusions, abatements, and credits. Many state governments, traditional utilities, municipal utilities and co-operative utilities offer a rebate or other cash incentive for the installation and operation of a solar energy system or energy efficiency measures. Capital costs or “up-front” rebates provide funds to solar customers based on the cost, size or expected production of a customer’s solar energy system. Performance-based incentives provide cash payments to a system owner based on the energy generated by their solar energy system during a pre-determined period, and they are paid over that time period. Depending on the cost of the system and other site-specific variables, tax incentives can typically cover 30-40% of the cost of a commercial or residential solar system.
 
Many states also have adopted procurement requirements for renewable energy production that requires regulated utilities to procure a specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customers in the state from eligible renewable energy sources, such as solar energy systems, by a specified date.
