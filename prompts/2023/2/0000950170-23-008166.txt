 Overview
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company envisioning a new way to treat cancer. Leveraging our novel targeted oncology platform, we have the goal to develop a new standard of care across multiple cancer indications. Our initial focus is on ocular and urologic oncology where the disease is diagnosed early and there is a high unmet medical need for targeted local therapies. Our proprietary platform enables the targeting of a broad range of solid tumors using Virus-like Particles, or VLPs, that can be conjugated with drugs or loaded with nucleic acids to create Virus-like Drug Conjugates, or VDCs. Our VDCs are largely agnostic to tumor type and can recognize a subset of modified tumor associated glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs, that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs expressed on the cell surface of many tumor cells and in the tumor microenvironment.
Bel-sar, our first VDC candidate, is being developed for the first-line treatment of early-stage choroidal melanoma, a rare disease with no drugs approved where the standard of care leaves many patients with blindness. We have received orphan drug designation for the treatment of uveal melanoma from the U.S Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of choroidal melanoma. We have completed a Phase 1b/2 trial using intravitreal administration that has demonstrated clinical proof of concept, assessed using endpoints in alignment with the feedback from the FDA. We are currently evaluating suprachoroidal, or SC, administration of bel-sar in a Phase 2 study. In February 2023 we presented average nine-month interim safety and efficacy data from this ongoing trial at Macula Society’s Annual Meeting which demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no posterior inflammation and no treatment-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, reported as of January 10, 2023. The results, with an average of nine months of follow up in patients who received a therapeutic regimen with three cycles of therapy, and who match the criteria for the planned global Phase 3 trial (n=8), showed a statistically significant reduction in the tumor growth rate (-0.289 mm/yr, p = <0.0001) compared to each patient’s documented growth rate at study entry, and a 100% (8/8) tumor control. In addition, the visual acuity preservation in the group of patients was 88% (7/8), with the majority of patients being at high-risk for vision loss with tumors close to fovea or optic disk. We have selected the SC route to conduct our global Phase 3 trial in alignment with regulatory agencies. We are currently conducting start up activities for the global Phase 3 study with the goal to dose our first patient in the first half of 2023. We are also developing bel-sar for additional ocular oncology indications and have an open IND in the United States for choroidal metastasis, supporting the potential of bel-sar to provide a novel treatment option that preserves vision for these patients. Choroidal metastasis is a high unmet medical need and the most common intraocular malignancy that is caused by multiple primary cancers in the body that metastasize to the eye (e.g., breast and lung cancer). These patients are treated by the same ocular oncologists that treat choroidal melanoma and there are no drugs approved that can treat the lesion in the eye and preserve vision. We received fast track designation from the FDA’s Division of Oncology and plan to initiate a Phase 2 study in this indication in the second half of 2023.
 In addition to our ocular oncology franchise, we are leveraging our targeted oncology platform to develop bel-sar in the field of urologic oncology with an initial indication for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC, where we received fast track designation by the FDA’s Division of Oncology. We initiated enrollment in a Phase 1 trial and we plan to present initial data from this trial in the second half of 2023.
VDCs are a novel class of drugs with a dual mechanism of action that promotes cancer cell death by both the delivery of the cytotoxic payload to generate acute necrosis and by activating a secondary immune mediated response. The tumor targeting specificity of VDCs is driven by the selective binding of the VLPs to a subset of modified tumor associated GAGs that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs expressed on the tumor cell membrane. This targeting mechanism enables the delivery of multiple types of cytotoxic payloads directly to a wide range of solid tumors.




Figure 1. Structure of our VDCs and HSPG Targeted Tumor Binding. The cytotoxic drug payload is covalently bound to the VLP to form the VDC. The capsid proteins that make up the VLP can recognize a subset of modified tumor associated GAGs that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs providing a highly selective tumor binding.
 We believe that our VDC platform has the potential to serve as a backbone for a broad portfolio of targeted oncology therapeutics and has the following potential key advantages:
1.A single VDC can deliver hundreds of cytotoxic molecules conjugated to its capsid proteins. 
 2.Based on the ability of VLPs to selectively recognize a subset of modified tumor associated GAGs that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs present on a large number of tumor types, VDCs have the potential to be used broadly across a wide range of cancers with limited off-target toxicity. 
 3.The VDCs have a high number of tumor associated GAG binding sites and this multi-valency permits the strong and selective binding to tumor cells. 
 4.VDCs have a dual mechanism of action, first by acute necrosis of the tumor cells, and subsequently by creating a highly immunogenic milieu that induces an antitumor specific immune response potentially leading to a more robust and durable therapy. 
 Our goal is to leverage our platform to develop a new class of targeted therapies that bring therapeutic benefit to multiple cancer indications, initially focusing on the field of ocular oncology, a field representing a potential $1.5 billion market opportunity. Our next area of focus, bladder cancer, is one of the most expensive cancers to treat on a per patient basis, and the global market for bladder cancer is expected to reach $4.0 billion by 2028 across the United States, EU5 and Japan. To date, we have produced a VDC, bel-sar, that we are advancing in multiple indications, as shown in the pipeline below.




We are initially developing bel-sar for the treatment of primary choroidal melanoma, a vision- and life-threatening ocular cancer for which there are currently no drugs approved. Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular cancer in adults, with an incidence of 11,000 patients/year in the United States and Europe. It is estimated that 96% of patients are diagnosed early without clinical evidence of metastatic disease. However, despite the current treatments with radiotherapy the long-term prognosis is poor with death occurring in more than 50% of cases and irreversible vision loss within 5 to 10 years in approximately 70% of cases. We intend to develop bel-sar as a first line therapy to treat early-stage disease which includes small melanomas and indeterminate lesions representing approximately 9,000 patients/year in the United States and Europe. Bel-sar has also been granted Orphan Drug designation for treatment of uveal melanoma by the EMA.
Bel-sar consists of an HPV-derived VLP conjugated to hundreds of infrared laser-activated molecules. The VDC is designed in a way that prevents the conjugation from interfering with tumor binding enabling its selectivity to tumor cells but not to normal cells. Laser activation of bel-sar is designed to result in precise tumor cell killing with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues. In the absence of bel-sar activation or binding to the tumor cell membrane, there is no cytotoxic effect. Multiple laser treatments, following a single dose of bel-sar, increase antitumor activity because of the reoxygenation of the tumor and the photostability of bel-sar. Finally, acute necrosis triggers immunogenic cell death leading to the generation of an adaptive, long-term antitumor immune response.
We have completed a Phase 1b/2 trial using intravitreal administration that has demonstrated clinical proof of concept, assessed using endpoints in alignment with the feedback from the FDA. We are currently evaluating suprachoroidal (SC) administration of bel-sar in a Phase 2 study. In February 2023 we presented average nine-month interim safety and efficacy data from this ongoing trial at Macula Society’s Annual Meeting which demonstrated a favorable safety profile with no posterior inflammation and no treatment-related SAEs reported as of January 10, 2023. The average nine-month interim data, in patients that are similar to our planned Phase 3 criteria and received the therapeutic regimen with three cycles of therapy, also continued to show 88% visual acuity preservation and tumor control of 100% including patients whose tumors were close to the fovea and optic nerve, with a highly statistically significant growth rate reduction (p = <0.0001). Based on these data we have selected the SC route to conduct our pivotal program in alignment with global regulatory agencies. We are currently conducting start up activities for the global Phase 3 trial with the goal to dose our first patient in the first half of 2023.
 In addition, we are developing bel-sar for the treatment of NMIBC. Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the urinary system and is the eighth most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. While metastatic bladder cancer has several approved therapies, there are very limited options for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk NMIBC. We have initiated clinical development of bel-sar with intramural administration, a novel route of administration, for the treatment of patients with intermediate and high-risk NMIBC. This novel route of administration is intended to place high levels of the drug at the base of the tumor where laser activation of bel-sar can cause necrosis and prevent residual tumor cells from further growth and recurrence. We have generated nonclinical in vivo data that supports that our dual mechanism of action can lead to cytotoxicity and long-term antitumor immunity which may further reduce the risk of metastases and it is highly synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors. We believe this immune response can play an important role in bladder cancer, given that bladder cancer has a well-documented response to immune activation. We initiated enrollment in a Phase 1 trial and plan to present initial data from this trial in 2023.

Our Strategy
Our goal is to leverage our proprietary platform to develop a new class of targeted therapies that deliver meaningful therapeutic benefit to a range of cancer indications with high unmet need in which we believe we can establish a new standard of care. The key elements of our strategy include:
▪Advance bel-sar through Phase 3 clinical development and, if approved, commercialization for the first line treatment of early-stage choroidal melanoma. We have completed a Phase 1b/2 trial using intravitreal administration that has demonstrated clinical proof of concept, assessed using endpoints in alignment with feedback from the FDA. We are currently evaluating SC administration of bel-sar in a Phase 2 trial in patients with choroidal melanoma and we presented average nine-month interim safety and efficacy data from this trial in February 2023 at Macula Society’s Annual Meeting. Based on the positive data from the Phase 2 SC study, we are proceeding with the SC route of administration and have started activities for the initiation of a global Phase 3 trial in early-stage CM in the first half of 2023. We have received orphan drug designation for treatment of uveal melanoma from FDA and EMA, and fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of choroidal melanoma and have aligned with FDA, EMA and the United Kingdom, or UK, MHRA on the design and endpoints of the global Phase 3 trial. If approved, this would represent the first therapy for primary choroidal melanoma as a first-line treatment option for early-stage disease, reserving radiotherapy for a second-line treatment option. If approved, we intend to independently commercialize bel-sar in ocular cancers using a limited sales force to target the approximately 50 ocular oncologists in the United States and approximately 50 ocular oncologists in Europe, who are a focused call point that treat most patients. 
 ▪Continue developing bel-sar for additional ocular oncology indications, starting with choroidal metastasis. We intend to be at the forefront of ocular oncology innovation and believe we can apply bel-sar's mechanism of action, which has shown the potential to treat tumors while preserving key ocular structures, to other cancers. Beyond early-stage choroidal melanoma, we intend to develop bel-sar in choroidal metastasis and multiple other ocular oncology indications. We plan to initiate a clinical trial in this indication in the second half of 2023. In addition, we plan to develop bel-sar for tumors of the ocular surface, including both melanomas and squamous cell carcinomas. We plan to leverage the sales force infrastructure we intend to build for primary choroidal melanoma for these additional ocular oncology indications. 


▪Pursue development of bel-sar for our first non-ophthalmic solid tumor indication in NMIBC. Our novel approach has the potential benefit of treating early-stage local tumors, particularly NMIBC, while generating long-term antitumor immunity to prevent metastasis. We believe that local administration into the bladder, and the ability to use a focused laser to activate bel-sar, provides the opportunity to apply our technology platform to this area of high unmet medical need. Bladder cancer represents an attractive indication given its sensitivity to immune response and high unmet medical need. Bel-sar’s pro-immunogenic mechanism of action has shown robust activity in nonclinical models as a single agent and synergy with checkpoint inhibitors in this indication. We have received fast track designation from the FDA’s Division of Oncology and we are currently enrolling patients in an ongoing Phase 1 study in NMIBC. We plan to present early data from this study in the second half of 2023. 
 ▪Broaden the application of our proprietary technology platform to expand our pipeline of product candidates. Due to the expression of tumor–modified HSPGs across a wide range of solid tumors, we plan to broadly evaluate our technology platform in other oncology indications. In addition, we plan to explore the possibility of delivering other therapeutic agents, including nucleic acid therapies and non-light activated molecules, to expand the potential of our technology platform across multiple solid tumors. 
Targeting a broad range of solid tumors with our proprietary technology platform
Our technology platform represents a novel approach of targeting a broad range of solid tumors using VLPs that can be loaded or conjugated with drugs creating a new class of targeted therapies.
The key finding that launched our technology development efforts was the observation that human papilloma virus, or HPV, binds to modified tumor associated GAGs that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs on the tumor cell membrane. GAGs are a large family of molecules found in the extracellular matrix and on the membranes of cells. Tumor cells specifically-modify GAGs that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs with key sulfation modifications that provide high binding specificity to a number of ligands. Tumor-modified HSPGs regulate many aspects of tumor progression, including proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastases. Our scientific founder, John Schiller, PhD, and his colleagues at the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, identified that these specific modifications enable the selective binding of HPV on tumor cells, as illustrated below.


Figure 2. VDCs bind to modified tumor associated GAGs that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs on the tumor cell surface with multivalent binding and do not bind to normal healthy cells.


This NIH team discovered that selective binding of HPV was determined by the properties of the proteins that make up the viral capsid, or shell, not by the nucleic acids contained within the shell. Dr. Schiller pioneered the development of VLPs into a highly effective HPV vaccine to prevent cancer, work for which he received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award. He discovered that these capsid proteins could be recombinantly manufactured and could self-assemble into empty VLPs without any viral genome. Our technology platform is based on HPV-derived VLPs that were further engineered to reduce cross-reactivity with pre-existing immunity against HPV, enabling the use of VLPs as oncology therapeutics. This platform leverages the tumor-specific targeting mechanism of HPV VLPs to enable their use to deliver cytotoxic payloads directly to a wide range of solid tumors. VLPs have also demonstrated the ability to deliver nucleic acids, potentially expanding our platform on which to base a novel class of oncology therapies.
Choroidal melanoma overview
Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular cancer in adults, with an incidence of 11,000 patients/year in the United States and Europe. This comprises approximately 90% of all cases of uveal melanoma, consisting of melanomas in the choroid, ciliary body and iris, which are collectively referred to as the uvea. It is estimated that 96% of patients are diagnosed without clinical evidence of metastatic disease. There are approximately 2,000 new cases treated each year in the United States and 1,600 new cases treated each year in Europe. However, despite the current treatments with radiotherapy, the long-term prognosis is poor with death occurring in more than 50% cases and irreversible vision loss within 5 to 10 years in approximately 70% of cases. We intend to develop bel-sar as a first line therapy to treat early-stage disease which includes small melanomas and indeterminate lesions representing approximately 9,000 patients in the United States and Europe. Most cases are found in adults with a median age of 55, light eye color and fair skin. It is often discovered in patients who are asymptomatic, although some patients report decreased vision or non-specific visual symptoms such as flashes, floaters, blurry or distorted vision or visual field defects. Most choroidal melanomas result from transformation of a benign choroidal nevus. In early-stage lesions, most of the tumor is composed of benign nevi cells with a small cluster of malignant melanoma cells. Benign choroidal nevi are found in approximately 5% of adults in the United States 40 years or older. There are 3,900 patients every year in the United States who are diagnosed with indeterminate melanocytic lesions that have risk factors and that are referred to the ocular oncologist.
Our goal is to develop bel-sar as a first line treatment option that can enable early-stage treatment of choroidal melanoma while preserving vision and reserving radiotherapy for a second line treatment option. Earlier diagnosis and early treatment intervention of lesions in the eye before the onset of metastatic disease may dramatically change outcomes for patients.
Current treatment options for primary choroidal melanoma
There are no FDA-approved therapies for primary choroidal melanoma. There are three common treatments that are routinely used for local control of choroidal melanoma: plaque brachytherapy; proton beam irradiation; and enucleation, or removal of the affected eye, each of which represent invasive surgical procedures.


Figure 3. Three primary treatments for choroidal melanoma.


The limited options available to treat patients with choroidal melanoma pose challenges to clinicians and patients. The existing treatments are far from innocuous: all of them are invasive procedures that are associated with irreversible loss of visual acuity and other deleterious side effects. Because choroidal melanoma tends to metastasize early, even with radical treatments such as enucleation, metastatic disease still occurs, which results in a high degree of mortality. We believe that there is an urgent unmet medical need for an effective vision preserving therapy and that the availability of such a therapy may encourage treatment of early-stage CMs and increase the awareness of the importance of early diagnosis for this life-threatening disease.
Our solution bel-sar
Bel-sar is a VDC consisting of an HPV-derived VLP and a phthalocyanine dye, a laser activated cytotoxic payload. Our VLP was created using the capsid proteins of HPV that have been genetically modified to avoid cross-reactivity with pre-existing immunity against the virus and bind with high affinity to modified tumor associated GAGs that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs surface of tumors cells, including ocular melanoma cells.


Figure 4. Bel-sar, administered by intraocular injection, binds to tumor cells. Activation using an ophthalmic laser leads to rupture of the tumor cell membrane, acute necrosis and a secondary immune activation leading to long term antitumor immunity.
 Goal of Treatment with Bel-sar
In ocular oncology, the goal of early-stage local treatment is to achieve a local cure and prevent the tumor from growing further which is defined as tumor control while preserving the delicate ocular structures such as the retina. We believe that treatment early in the disease course can also limit the risk of metastasis for patients. After treatment, if tumors do not have an increase in thickness by ultrasound or an increase in diameter as evaluated with digital photography, it is believed that the malignant cells have been killed, tumor control has been achieved and the treatment is considered successful or equivalent to a local cure. Ocular oncologists measure the antitumor activity after plaque brachytherapy by evaluating tumor control as well as systemic disease to detect the presence of metastasis.



Figure 5. Goal of treatment with bel-sar is local tumor control with targeted killing of melanoma cells.
 We believe that patients with early-stage choroidal melanoma stand to derive the most benefit from bel-sar. These tumors are not only the most likely to respond to our therapy but, based on historic data, these patients also have the highest likelihood of not having already developed life-threatening metastatic disease, and as such, bel-sar has the potential to confer the greatest long-term benefit.
Phase 1b/2 demonstrated proof of concept as assessed by meaningful clinical endpoints: tumor control and visual acuity preservation
 A total of 56 patients enrolled with a clinical diagnosis of primary choroidal melanoma were treated with bel-sar using an intravitreal route of administration.
The data at 12 months demonstrated a clear dose response between patients treated at sub-therapeutic doses/regimens with a tumor control rate of 44% and those treated at the therapeutic regimen with two cycles of therapy at the highest dose which achieved a tumor control rate of 70%. In addition, this robust tumor control was accompanied by a high rate of visual acuity preservation of >70% including a high percentage of patients with tumors close to the fovea or optic disk considered at high risk for vision loss. Treatment with bel-sar was generally reported to be well-tolerated at all doses including the highest treatment regimen with two cycles of therapy. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate, transient and manageable with standard of care treatments in most patients. Expected AEs of vitreous inflammation, anterior chamber inflammation and increased intraocular pressure were manageable with steroid treatment and ocular antihypertensives. There were only two drug-related SAEs of vision loss related to pigmentary changes around the edge of the tumor.

 Suprachoroidal delivery
As part of our overall development strategy, we are evaluating and developing the SC route of administration to optimize the delivery of bel-sar to the choroid where the tumor is located. The suprachoroidal space, or SCS, is a potential space bound between the external surface of the choroid and the internal surface of the sclera and encompasses the full circumference of the posterior segment of the eye.
 

Figure 6. Suprachoroidal administration with SCS MicroinjectorTM.
 Based on our nonclinical data, we believe SC administration of bel-sar can result in a better target product profile with reduced inflammation because of significantly lower exposure of the drug to the vitreous and potentially higher clinical activity than intravitreal administration because of increased drug exposure to the tumor in the choroid.

Phase 2 suprachoroidal administration trial
We are currently conducting a Phase 2 dose-escalation trial of bel-sar with SC administration in up to 22 patients with choroidal melanoma. The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and treatment regimen. The safety and tolerability data as of the January 10, 2023 data cutoff (n=20) demonstrated that SC administration was generally well tolerated. In addition, the tolerability profile was substantially improved versus the safety profile observed in the phase 1b/2 study using IVT administration, with no dose limiting toxicities or serious treatment related adverse events reported. No deaths have been reported in any of the trials to date. As summarized in Figure 7 below, drug and laser related adverse events have been mild and only five patients had anterior chamber cells and/or inflammation, which resolved spontaneously or with standard of care treatment. Four moderate adverse events are not listed in the table and were related to the injection procedure, with one each of anterior scleritis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctival edema and eye irritation. Of note, no inflammation in the vitreous has been observed in this trial with up to three cycles of the highest tested dose (80 µg with 2 laser applications). A total of 6 SAEs unrelated to treatment have been reported in 3 patients: 1 unrelated SAE of retinal detachment in 1 patient, 1 unrelated SAE of retinal vein occlusion in 1 patient and 4 unrelated SAEs of sarcoma, seizure, brain abscess and deep vein thrombosis in 1 patient. Given the generally favorable tolerability profile we increased the treatment regimen to three cycles of treatment which was one cycle more than the highest regimen in the IVT trial. The preliminary safety and tolerability of 3 cycles has been evaluated, and based on the data observed to date, additional patients in this cohort may be enrolled. We plan to present an average of 12-month safety and efficacy data from this trial in the second half of 2023.



Figure 7. Adverse events among the 20 patients enrolled in the Phase 2 suprachoroidal trial to date.


The data from the ongoing Phase 2 study using suprachoroidal administration was presented at Macula Society’s 46th Annual Meeting in February 2023 and continued to demonstrate a robust dose response between the subtherapeutic dose regimens (20% tumor control) and the therapeutic dose regimens with three cycles of therapy (89% tumor control) (Figure 8). In addition, the safety profile to date has been favorable with no treatment related SAEs or significant AEs, which is encouraging given that the majority of these patients had tumors close to the fovea or optic disk. The longer follow up (average of nine months) and the consistency of response in the planned Phase 3 patient population with 100% tumor control and 90% visual acuity preservation strongly support the assumptions for the success of the global Phase 3 trial which is on track to enroll the first patient in the first half of 2023. The vision preservation rates were 88% or better in all subgroups, including patients assigned to the highest dose regimens. Seven of the 8 patients assigned to the highest dose regimens were at high risk for vision loss if treated with radiotherapy (tumors ≤3 mm from the fovea or optic disc) (Figure 9).

Global Phase 3 trial plan in choroidal melanoma
In alignment with the FDA, EMA and MHRA, we initiated activities of our Phase 3 trial AU-011-301. This is a randomized, adaptive, sham-controlled, patient, assessor, and sponsor-masked trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bel-sar treatment via SC administration in patients with early-stage choroidal melanoma to support potential marketing authorization (Figure 10). We intend to randomize a minimum of 85 patients in this trial to three arms 2:1:2 to receive therapeutic regimen bel-sar, low dose regimen bel-sar or a sham control. We will use an enrichment strategy and plan to enroll patients based on having a small amount of active growth within two years prior to trial enrollment. This will ensure that patients have actively growing lesions allowing for a reduction in the variability of timing and event rates of selected endpoints being used to establish the efficacy of bel-sar treatment.
 The trial will utilize an adaptive design with the ability to perform a sample size re-estimation. With this adaptive design, there will be an interim analysis approximately one month before the last patient is enrolled and the sample size could be increased from 85 patients up to 105 patients if either (1) the overall observed event rate is lower than assumed or (2) if the estimated ratio of events between the arms is slightly different than the current assumptions.
Figure 10. Phase 3 Adaptive Design Showing Interim Analysis and Potential Sample Size
Re-estimation from 85 Patients to 105 Patients.
 The regimen of three cycles in the 80 µg bel-sar arm is based on preliminary safety data observed with this regimen, which was the highest tested in the Phase 2 AU-011-202 trial with no dose-limiting toxicities, treatment related severe AEs, or treatment related SAEs reported, as well as supportive preliminary efficacy data observed with this regimen. The principal objective of the inclusion of the 40 µg bel-sar treatment arm is to minimize bias and improve masking of the 80 µg bel-sar treatment arm as requested by the FDA and is not powered for statistical comparison. However, summary statistics will be reported for the 40 µg bel-sar treatment arm using the primary, key secondary, and selected additional endpoints. A dose of 40 µg and 2 laser applications with the same regimen of 3 cycles was chosen for the second bel-sar treatment arm as this was the second highest dose/regimen tested in the Phase 2 SC trial (Cohort 5) and we believe it may have a therapeutic potential.
 The trial will be patient, assessor (VA examiners and IRC readers) and sponsor-masked. Masked readers at the IRC will assess the imaging data-based efficacy assessments including tumor thickness and largest basal, diameter, or LBD, during the trial. Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed using the ETDRS protocol by masked, certified, VA examiners. All measures will be taken to mask the patients during their trial participation period including the use of sham SC injections and sham laser on assigned treatment days.
Any patient in the trial who meets the tumor progression definition will be treated with SoC therapies as rescue treatment per Investigator judgment. SoC therapies will include, but are not limited to, brachytherapy and proton beam therapy. This will ensure that no patient has a delayed treatment if the tumor is progressing, and importantly, that all of the sham patients receive their SoC treatment in a timely manner and no later than in the regular clinical practice. The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 trial will be a composite time to event analysis that will evaluate the number of events of tumor progression or visual acuity failure between the high dose bel-sar group and the sham group using a log rank test. The first key secondary endpoint will be the time to tumor progression. And we will also evaluate the tumor thickness growth rate over 52 weeks and visual acuity failure up to 52 weeks There will be a minimum follow up for all patients of 12 months.

The trial has a power of >90% to meet the primary endpoint. Since there is no drug approved for the treatment of choroidal melanoma, we have aligned with FDA that a statistically significant difference on the primary endpoint will provide support from a regulatory perspective to meet the requirement of clinical effectiveness.
If warranted by the data, we plan to submit the results of the Phase 3 trial to support approval of bel-sar for the treatment of primary indeterminate lesions and small choroidal melanoma. Based on the results of the Phase 3 trial, if positive, and the fact that there are no therapies approved for the treatment of this rare disease and that the standard of care with radiotherapy leaves patients with irreversible vision loss, the FDA and EMA may agree to grant approval based on a single Phase 3 trial. However, the FDA and/or EMA may require two Phase 3 trials for approval, which will be addressed subsequent to reviewing the data from the Phase 3 trial with the regulators.
Registry Study
We have agreement with the FDA, EMA, and MHRA that we will monitor all patients for a total of five years after start of dosing to evaluate the metastatic and mortality risks as well as the long-term tumor response, visual acuity preservation and safety, which we are doing in a Phase 4 Registry study.
 As of January 11th, 2023, all 57 patients in the Phase 1b/2 trial (AU-011-101) with intravitreal administration have completed the trial and 45/57 have entered the Registry study. In addition, 14/20 patients from the ongoing Phase 2 trial (AU-011-202) with SC administration have also entered the Registry study. The data collected in the Registry is intended to assess the long-term (5 total years) safety, rate of metastatic disease, mortality, tumor control, and visual acuity preservation from bel-sar treatment.
Matched case control studies
The ability to demonstrate tumor control with long-term visual acuity preservation supports the potential of bel-sar to become the standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients with early-stage choroidal melanoma compared to an invasive radiotherapy procedure that leaves most patients with irreversible vision loss and other long-term comorbidities. To demonstrate the long-term value of visual acuity preservation for patients treated with bel-sar, we are conducting two retrospective Matched Case Control, or MCC, studies that will provide data comparing bel-sar to brachytherapy. The first retrospective MCC study has been performed to provide an estimate of the vision benefit of bel-sar, with IVT administration versus brachytherapy and a second retrospective MCC study with SC administration to support the overall visual results is planned once the AU-011-301 trial is completed. These studies are discussed below.

Retrospective matched case control study with intravitreal administration
To assess the vision preservation benefit of bel-sar compared to brachytherapy we are conducting a retrospective MCC analysis comparing the group of patients in our Phase 1b/2 trial who had tumors at high risk for vision loss due to its location close to the fovea or optic disk and were treated with bel-sar (n=43) to patients with tumors of similar size and location previously treated with brachytherapy at the Wills Eye Hospital Ocular Oncology Service led by Dr. Carol Shields. This study matched patients up to 5:1 using the key baseline characteristics that impact long-term visual acuity – tumor location, tumor size and baseline visual acuity – and we are comparing the visual acuity after treatment with each therapy in terms of a change from baseline in vision and absolute vision every year for up to 5 years. As shown in Figure 11, the initial trial results showed a statistically significant vision preservation benefit for bel-sar compared to brachytherapy at year 2. Importantly, the data showed that vision after treatment with bel-sar remained stable through the first and second year demonstrating the long-term visual acuity benefit of the treatment with bel-sar. In the current analysis the vision results from year 2 with bel-sar were extrapolated to compare against the vision data with brachytherapy through year 5 (Figure 11). By year 5 there was over an 8-line benefit (>0.8 logMAR difference) of vision preservation comparing bel-sar (orange bar) to brachytherapy (blue bar).
 


Figure 11. Comparison of visual acuity outcomes (logMAR Vision) after treatment with bel-sar versus treatment with Brachytherapy
We believe that the results of this retrospective study validate and strengthen our data supporting that the treatment with bel-sar results in durable preservation of visual acuity which provides an important advantage to brachytherapy as a first line treatment option for early-stage disease. We look forward to publishing these results with Dr. Carol Shields/Wills Eye Hospital in the second half of 2023 and to continue to analyze the data up to year five.
Retrospective matched case control study with suprachoroidal administration
Based on the positive results from the IVT rMCC study we are going to conduct a second retrospective MCC study in lieu of a prospective study. We will compare the visual acuity of patients treated with bel-sar with SC administration from both the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies versus the visual acuity of patients treated with plaque brachytherapy.

Choroidal metastasis from other tumors
We can apply our mechanism of action for bel-sar, which we believe has the ability to preserve key ocular structures, in multiple other ocular oncology indications. Beyond primary choroidal melanoma, we are developing bel-sar in additional ocular oncology indications, starting with choroidal metastasis. Choroidal metastasis is a common intraocular malignancy that is caused by multiple primary cancers in the body that metastasize to the eye due to the high blood flow and perfusion that provides an environment in the choroid receptive to metastases and tumor growth. Approximately 22,000 patients have choroidal metastasis globally every year and approximately half (~47%) of the patients with choroidal metastasis have primary breast tumors. Other common primary cancers include lung (approximately 21%), gastrointestinal (4%), kidney (2%), cutaneous melanoma (2%) and prostate cancer (2%), and approximately 17% of cases with an unknown primary tumor type. The majority of these malignancies are solitary small tumors in the choroid associated with subretinal fluid and as opposed to choroidal melanoma, they can occur in and adversely affect vision in both eyes. These lesions are typically treated with radiation, which has the same comorbidities as previously described for the treatment of choroidal melanoma. Given their poor prognosis, the quality of life and, in particular, maintenance of vision, for patients with metastatic cancer is critical and as such there is a significant unmet need for an effective vision sparing ocular treatment that enables patients to avoid additional surgical interventions.
The IND has been opened with the FDA, where we received fast track designation, and we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in choroidal metastasis in the second half 2023.
 Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer
We are developing bel-sar for the treatment of NMIBC utilizing an intramural route of administration for the treatment of patients with intermediate and high-risk bladder cancer. This novel route of administration is based on the direct administration of bel-sar into the lamina propria of the bladder wall at the tumor edge. It is intended to place high levels of bel-sar at the base of the tumor where laser activation can cause localized necrosis preventing residual tumor cells from further growth and potentially solving tumor recurrence, which is one of the highest unmet medical needs in this disease. We began a Phase 1 trial in late 2022 and the trial is currently enrolling.
Bladder cancer disease background
Bladder cancer is the most common malignancy involving the urinary system and is the eighth most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. Estimates are that there will be 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer and 17,000 deaths in 2021 in the United States. Globally, bladder cancer accounts for approximately 570,000 cases, with 422,000 cases comprised of NMIBC, and 165,000 deaths each year. Patients with bladder cancer classically present with painless blood in the urine, however, because this symptom is like those of benign disorders such as urinary tract infections, cystitis, prostatitis and the passage of kidney stones, the diagnosis of bladder cancer is often delayed while these other, more common, conditions are ruled out. Furthermore, symptoms are often intermittent. Delays in diagnosis can lead to a worsened prognosis due to the presence of more advanced stage disease by the time a confirmation of bladder cancer is made.
Our solution bel-sar
We are currently developing bel-sar for the treatment of NMIBC and have initiated a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the feasibility of intramural administration and to assess distribution, safety and proof-of-mechanism with evaluation of local acute cellular necrosis after laser activation. We believe bel-sar represents a potential targeted therapy that can be activated using a similar laser as that currently utilized in our choroidal melanoma program, following a well-characterized approach with commercially available devices used by urologists.

Bel-sar has been observed to be highly selective, through both its specific binding to a subset of modified GAGs that are part of the heparan sulphate chain of HSPGs on cancer cells, combined with focused laser activation leading to cytotoxicity and subsequent immune activation. We believe the immune response could play an even larger role in bladder cancer, given that bladder cancer has a well-documented response to immune activation. This immune sensitivity is substantiated by the effectiveness of immune modulatory agents like Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, or BCG. We have observed in nonclinical experiments that bel-sar was able to target bladder cancer cells in both in vitro and in vivo tumor models. Laser activation of bel-sar resulted in cell killing of bladder tumor cells while sparing other normal surrounding cells as a single agent. This cell killing induced a pro-immunogenic antitumor response that resulted in complete and durable tumor regressions in mouse xenograft models as well as the prevention of tumor re-implantation. This highlights the value of bel-sar to generate antitumor immunity and prevent tumor recurrence. Based on our nonclinical data, bel-sar was also observed to be highly synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors that have already been approved and are in development for the treatment of NMIBC and metastatic bladder cancer patients.

Clinical plans in NMIBC
We are currently enrolling a Phase 1 trial in intermediate and high-risk NMIBC patients that are either candidates for transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, or TURBT, or cystectomy. The trial design is presented in Figure 13 below.
 

Figure 13. Phase 1 window of opportunity trial to establish route of administration and tumor necrosis.
 In this Phase 1 trial, we intend to evaluate the tumor distribution of bel-sar after intramural administration in intermediate to high-risk patients with NMIBC undergoing TURBT or cystectomy. In cohorts 1a and 1b, we are assessing bel-sar local and systemic exposure without laser activation. In cohorts 2, 3 and 4 we are assessing bel-sar plus laser activation in patients with intermediate risk that are planned to receive TURBT and high-risk patients that are unresponsive to BCG and that are planned to receive cystectomy. In these cohorts, we plan to administer bel-sar followed by laser activation, and one week later the tumor will be removed by TURBT (cohorts 2 and 4) or the entire bladder will be removed by cystectomy (cohort 3), and we will assess tumor response in the form of necrosis and the immune response by pathology and immunohistochemistry. This Phase 1 trial is being conducted at approximately 10 sites in the United States.
Other HSPG-Expressing Tumors
Our HPV-derived VLPs have a unique tropism towards cancer cells based on their multivalent binding to modified HSPGs that are specifically found in tumor cells. In vitro, we have observed our VLPs bind to multiple cancer cell lines. In vivo, we have also observed binding using our HPV-derived VLPs using xenografts of human tumor cell lines and allografts of murine tumor cell lines, like lung, ovarian, bladder, melanoma and colon. These results help to corroborate the thesis that multiple tumors appear to consistently express and specifically modify HSPGs. Accordingly, we believe we may be able treat a broad spectrum of solid tumors. We plan to select our next solid tumor indication for clinical development with bel-sar based on its status as a tumor type with high HSPG expression, such as cutaneous melanoma and head and neck cancer.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid innovation of new technologies, fierce competition and strong defense of intellectual property. While we believe that bel-sar and our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others.

We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and companies focusing on developing therapies in the oncology field. These companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with currently approved therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue oncology therapeutics. Key product features that would affect our ability to effectively compete with other therapeutics include the efficacy, safety and convenience of our products.
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize bel-sar and any future product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
Ocular oncology
Currently we are not aware of any other company that has a drug in clinical development for the treatment of early-stage disease, which includes indeterminate lesions and small choroidal melanomas, or for the treatment of choroidal metastasis, which are our first two planned ocular oncology indications. The standard of care as a first line treatment for patients is plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy. Verteporfin (Visudyne) is currently used off label in some cases of early-stage disease alone or in combination with transpupillary thermotherapy. It is possible that there may be other companies with compounds in preclinical development but we are not aware of any data that has been published or presented at any conference. Given our stage of development, we believe we are the furthest along in development. Our focus in ocular oncology is the early treatment of the primary cancer in the eye before it metastasizes. Immunocore Holdings PLC, or Immunocore, recently received FDA approval for KIMMTRAK® (tebentafusp-tebn) injection for metastatic uveal melanoma. Immunocore’s drug is indicated for the treatment of HLA-A*02:01-positive adult patients with unresectable or metastatic uveal melanoma and has not been developed to treat the early-stage disease in the eye. Ideaya Biosciences is in Phase 2 clinical development to treat metastatic uveal melanoma. In addition, they have initiated a study with neoadjuvant treatment in patients that are selected to receive enucleation or radiotherapy with the goal of either preserving the eye or reducing the dose of radiotherapy.
 Urologic oncology
There are multiple companies that have drugs in clinical development for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk NMIBC patients that are unresponsive to BCG and several trials ongoing in BCG naïve patients. Ferring Pharmaceuticals has recently obtained FDA approval for ADSTILADRIN for the treatment of adult patients with high-risk BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ, or CIS, with or without papillary tumors. ImmunityBio, Inc. has presented Phase 2/3 data for their drug Anktiva in combination with BCG in patients with BCG unresponsive high grade NMIBC and has submitted a BLA with a PDUFA date of May 23, 2023. UroGen Pharma Ltd. has a drug Jelmyto, a gel reformulation of mytomicin that is currently approved to treat low grade upper tract urothelial cancer, which is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of NMIBC. CG Oncology’s cretostimogene grenadenorepvec (CG0070) is being investigated in a global Phase 3 clinical trial as a monotherapy for the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC and in combination with KEYTRUDA in a Phase 2 trial in the same indication. Asieris Pharmaceuticals has APL-1202 in development for NMIBC as a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies. Pembrolizumab has been approved for or the treatment of BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS (with or without papillary tumors) for patients who are unfit or unwilling to undergo radical cystectomy. In addition, there are several additional immune checkpoint inhibitors, or ICIs, in development as a monotherapy and there are a number of combination trials with ICIs in an effort to improve efficacy and durability of response. In addition, there are several early-stage treatments entering the clinic such as Protara Therapeutics, Inc.’s TARA-200.

Government Regulation
The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with our vendors, collaboration partners, contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturers, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical, manufacturing and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval of our product candidate. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals of drugs and ensuring subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

In the United States, where we initially focused our product development, the FDA regulates biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Biologics are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Our product candidate, bel-sar, has not been approved by the FDA for marketing in the United States.
The process required by the FDA before any product candidates we develop are approved for therapeutic indications and may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
▪completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, requirements; 
 ▪submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made; 
 ▪approval by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated; 
 ▪performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended purpose; 
 ▪preparation and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal trials, accompanied by payment of FDA user fees; 
 ▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; 
 ▪satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product will be produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency; 
 ▪potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and 
 ▪FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic in the United States. 
 Nonclinical studies and clinical trials for biologics
Before testing any drug or biologic in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous nonclinical testing. Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess safety and in some cases to establish the rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of nonclinical studies is subject to federal and state regulations and requirements, including GLP requirements for safety and toxicology studies. The results of the nonclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and it must become effective before clinical trials may begin. The central focus of an IND submission is on the protocol(s) for the initial clinical trial and the general investigational plan. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and imposes a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a trial. A separate protocol submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted in the United States, each of which may begin following a 30 day period unless the FDA issues a clinical hold on the clinical trial.

The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters and criteria to be used in monitoring safety and evaluating effectiveness. Each protocol to be conducted in the United States, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as an amendment to the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted, or by a central IRB, to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable related to the anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trials to public registries. Information about applicable clinical trials, including clinical trials results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States under its IND may need to obtain waivers for certain regulatory compliance requirements such as those requiring IRB review and approval. However, the FDA does not require that all foreign clinical trials be conducted under United States INDs. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.
Clinical trials to evaluate therapeutic indications to support BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which phases may overlap or be conducted in combination.
▪Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the investigational product into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness. 
 ▪Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 ▪Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the investigational product to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA. 
 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA.

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human participants exposed to the biologic and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and manufacturers must develop, among other things, methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life and to identify appropriate storage conditions for the product candidate.
Expanded Access
Expanded access, sometimes called “compassionate use,” is the use of investigational products outside of intended clinical development to treat patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases or conditions when there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative treatment options. FDA regulations allow access to investigational products under an IND by the company or the treating physician for treatment purposes for the following expanded access requests: individual patients (single-patient IND applications for treatment in emergency settings and non-emergency settings); intermediate-size patient populations; and larger populations for use of the investigational product under a treatment protocol or treatment IND application. There is no requirement for a company to provide expanded access to its investigational product.
BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our product candidates. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a biologics license application, or BLA. A BLA is a request for approval to market a new biologic for one or more specified indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a biological product that includes a new clinically active component, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.

The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. Under the goals and polices agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA filed for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Further, under PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions may be available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA may refer an application for a biologic to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, which reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation, for example, as to whether the biologic is sufficiently safe and efficacious in a given indication for a given population and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making marketing approval decisions.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and other requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
The FDA also may require submission of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition for approving the BLA to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk-minimization tools.
After evaluating the BLA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a Complete Response Letter. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter will usually describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response Letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response Letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.

Even if the FDA approves a product, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Expedited development and review programs for biologics
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.
A new biologic is eligible for fast track designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Fast track designation provides increased opportunities for sponsor interactions with the FDA during preclinical and clinical development, in addition to the potential for rolling review once a marketing application is filed, meaning that the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
In addition, a new drug or biological product may be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the biologic, alone or in combination with or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Breakthrough therapy designation provides all the features of fast track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient development program beginning as early as Phase 1, and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate.
Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with fast track or breakthrough therapy designation, may also be eligible for additional FDA programs intended to expedite the review and approval process, including priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).
A product intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than on irreversible morbidity or mortality which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.

Accelerated approval is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval studies to verify and describe the product’s clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Sponsors are also required to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct such studies in a timely manner and send the necessary updates to the FDA, or if a confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, that all advertising and promotional materials that are intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period, and that after 120 days following marketing approval, all advertising and promotional materials must be submitted at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination or publication.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the scientific or medical standards for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval but may expedite the development or review process.
Post-approval requirements for biologics
Drugs and biologics manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe approved products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, including not only by company employees but also by agents of the company or those speaking on the company’s behalf, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including liabilities under the False Claims Act where products carry reimbursement under federal health care programs. Promotional materials for approved biologics must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. Further, if there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-market testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.

In addition, drug and biologics manufacturers and their subcontractors involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products, including those supplying products, ingredients, and components of such products, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Manufacturers and other parties involved in the drug supply chain for prescription drug products must also comply with product tracking and tracing requirements and for notifying the FDA of counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products or products that are otherwise unfit for distribution in the United States. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. There is also a continuing, annual program fee for any marketed product. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, requirements for post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 
 ▪safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; 
 ▪mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and issuance of corrective information; 
 ▪fines, warning letters, or untitled letters; 
 ▪holds on clinical trials; 
 ▪refusal of the FDA to approve applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; 
 ▪product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 ▪injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and 
 ▪consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. 
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation, or ODD, to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with either a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population greater of than 200,000 individuals in the United States when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug or biologic in the United States will be recovered from sales in the United States of that drug or biologic. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA.
If a product that has received ODD and subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular clinically active component for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years from the approval of the BLA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of ODD are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee.

A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received ODD. In addition, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
The Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and regulatory interpretation of the BPCIA remain subject to significant uncertainty.
Regulation of Combination Products in the United States
Certain products may be comprised of components, such as biologic components and device components, that would normally be regulated under different types of regulatory authorities, and by different centers at the FDA. These products are known as combination products. Specifically, under regulations issued by the FDA, a combination product may be:
▪a product comprised of two or more regulated components that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity; 
 ▪two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products; 
 ▪a drug, or device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration or significant change in dose; or 


▪any investigational drug, device or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect. 
 Under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA is charged with assigning a center with primary jurisdiction, or a lead center, for review of a combination product. The designation of a lead center generally eliminates the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for combination products, although it does not preclude consultations by the lead center with other components of FDA. The determination of which center will be the lead center is based on the “primary mode of action” of the combination product. Thus, if the primary mode of action of a biologic-device combination product is attributable to the biologic product, the FDA center responsible for premarket review of the biologic product would have primary jurisdiction for the combination product. The FDA has also established an Office of Combination Products to address issues surrounding combination products and provide more certainty to the regulatory review process. That office is responsible for developing guidance and regulations to clarify the regulation of combination products, and for assignment of the FDA center that has primary jurisdiction for review of combination products where the jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
A combination product with a biologic primary mode of action generally would be reviewed and approved pursuant to FDA’s biologic approval processes. In reviewing the BLA application for such a product, however, FDA reviewers in the biologics center could consult with their counterparts in the device center to ensure that the device component of the combination product met applicable requirements regarding safety, effectiveness, durability and performance. In addition, under FDA’s regulations, combination products are subject to applicable current GMP requirements for drugs, biologics and devices, including the Quality System regulations applicable to medical devices.
Other Regulatory Matters
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of product candidates following product approval, where applicable, or commercialization are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, which may include the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments and governmental agencies.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, patients generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels.
There is also significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within the DHHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:
▪a covered benefit under its health plan; 
 ▪safe, effective and medically necessary; 
 ▪appropriate for the specific patient; 


▪cost-effective; and 
 ▪neither experimental nor investigational. 
 Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs.
In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union, or EU, provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 Health Care Laws and Regulations
Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business that may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation:
▪the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil monetary penalties; 
 ▪the federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the False Claims Act, prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false of fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery; 


▪the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 ▪the federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Sunshine Act” under the ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physician (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals; as well as the ownership and investment interests of such physicians and their immediate family members; 
 ▪HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and its implementing regulations, which also imposes obligations on certain covered entity healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, as well as their covered subcontractors, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; 
 ▪analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures; and 
 ▪state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts, and analogous foreign laws and regulations. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and responsible individuals may be subject to imprisonment.

Health Care Legislative Updates
Payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs, and those methods are not always specifically adapted for new technologies such as gene therapy and therapies addressing rare diseases such as those we are developing. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In particular, in 2010, the ACA was enacted, which, among other things, subjected biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers up to 2% per fiscal year. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% payment reduction which remains in effect through 2031. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers will be further reduced starting in 2025 absent further legislation. The U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Further, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
 Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would limit the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.


Regulation in the EU
Drug Development
In the EU our product candidates may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization, or MA, from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all Member States (and so does not require national implementing legislation in each Member State), and aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the EU. For example, a single application is now made through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS, for clinical trial authorization in up to 30 EU or additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA, countries at the same time and with a single set of documentation.
The assessment of applications for clinical trials is divided into two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State, however overall related timelines are defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation also provides for simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.
We have a SME status with the EMA as a small and medium-sized enterprise. This enables us to continue to have access to administrative, regulatory and financial support, including fee reductions for scientific advice and regulatory procedures.
Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is usually governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
Drug Review and Approval
In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining an MA. There are two types of MAs.
▪The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU, and the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. We therefore consider our product candidates would fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MA application considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who makes the final decision to grant an MA, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MA application under the accelerated assessment procedure is 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment. 
 ▪National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the decentralized procedure. 
 Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
As part of its marketing authorization process, the EMA may grant MAs for certain categories of medicinal products on the basis of less complete data than is normally required, where the benefit of immediate availability of the medicine outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required or in the interests of public health. In such cases, it is possible for the CHMP to recommend the granting of an MA, subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually, which is referred to as a conditional MA. This may apply to medicinal products for human use that fall under the jurisdiction of the EMA, including those that are aimed at the treatment, the prevention, or the medical diagnosis of seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases.
A conditional MA may be granted when the CHMP finds that, although comprehensive clinical data referring to the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied, all the following requirements are met:
▪the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is positive; 
 ▪it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data post-authorization; 
 ▪the medicinal products fulfils an unmet medical need; and 
 ▪the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 


The granting of a conditional MA is restricted to situations in which only the clinical part of the application is not yet fully complete. Incomplete preclinical or quality data may only be accepted if duly justified and only in the case of a product intended to be used in emergency situations in response to public health threats. Conditional MAs are valid for one year, on a renewable basis. The MA holder will be required to complete ongoing trials or to conduct new trials with a view to confirming that the benefit-risk balance is positive. In addition, specific obligations may be imposed in relation to the collection of pharmacovigilance data.
Compassionate Use
Compassionate use programs allow for the use of unauthorized medicines for a specific group of patients under strict conditions. The EMA provides recommendations on how a medicine should be used in a compassionate use program and the type of patient who may benefit from treatment, however the individual Member States implement their own rules in respect of the administration of such programs. Competent authorities of the Member States can also ask the EMA for an opinion on how to administer, distribute and use certain medicines for compassionate use.
Compassionate use programs are only available for a group of patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered to be life-threatening, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. The medicinal product provided through a compassionate use program must either be the subject of an MA application or must be undergoing clinical trials.
New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete and independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon the grant of an MA and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA, for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MA can be submitted and authorized, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an application with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EU, the European Commission grants an orphan designation in respect of a product if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition and either (i) such condition affects no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) without incentives, it is unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development. In each case, there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition which has been authorized (or, if such a method exists, the product in question would be of significant benefit to those affected by the applicable condition).

In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following the grant of an MA for the orphan product. This period may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. During the period of market exclusivity, an MA may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the MA holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the MA holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for an MA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Pediatric Investigation Plan
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the product for which an MA is being sought. The PDCO can grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Further, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when this data is not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Products that are granted an MA with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP (even where such results are negative) are eligible for six months’ supplementary protection certificate, or SPC, extension, provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to two years before the SPC expires. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.
PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage product development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the MA application will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which where is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MA application assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the EMA’s CHMP or Committee for Advanced Therapies are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.

Post-Approval Requirements
Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the Member States. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
All new MA applications must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conducting of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each Member State and can differ from one country to another.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
 Pricing and Reimbursement
In the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. The delivery of healthcare in the EU, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than EU, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of healthcare and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so-called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval.
The EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced Member States) can further reduce prices. Special pricing and reimbursement rules may apply to orphan medicinal products. Inclusion of orphan medicinal products in reimbursement systems tend to focus on the medical usefulness, need, quality and economic benefits to patients and the healthcare system as for any medicinal product. Acceptance of any medicinal product for reimbursement may come with cost, use and often volume restrictions, which again can vary by country. In addition, results-based rules of reimbursement may apply.
European Data Collection
The collection, use, or other processing of personal data, including clinical trial data, regarding individuals in the EEA is governed by the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and similar processing of personal data regarding individuals in the UK, is governed by the UK General Data Protection Regulation, or UK GDPR, and the UK Data Protection Act 2018. In this document, “GDPR” refers to both the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, unless specified otherwise. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA/UK and to companies established outside the EEA/UK that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to, or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA/UK. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for companies processing personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, special provisions for “sensitive information” including health and genetic information of data subjects, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements and direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA/UK to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States/UK may result in fines up to 20 million euros (£17.5 million under the UK GDPR) or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR.
Regulation in the UK
 Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the UK
 The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, and the UK and the EU have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement or TCA, which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021 and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). Except in respect of the new Clinical Trials Regulation, the regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore aligns with current EU medicines regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. However, notwithstanding that there is no wholesale recognition of EU pharmaceutical legislation under the TCA, under the new framework mentioned below which will be put in place by the MHRA from January 1, 2024, the MHRA has stated that it will take into account decisions on the approval of MAs from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for a Great Britain MA.
Clinical Trials
The UK has implemented the now-repealed Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC into national law through the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). The extent to which the regulation of clinical trials in the UK will mirror the new Clinical Trials Regulation now it has come into effect is not yet known, but the MHRA opened a consultation on a set of proposals designed to improve and strengthen the UK clinical trials legislation. Such consultation took place from January 17, 2022 until March 14, 2022, and the MHRA is currently analyzing feedback.
Great Britain Marketing Authorizations
As a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized MAs continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland. A separate MA is, however, required in order to place medicinal products on the market in Great Britain.

On January 1, 2021, all medicinal products with a centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new MA in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. This is known as the EC Decision Reliance Procedure, or ECDRP. Under the ECDRP, an MA application can be submitted to the MHRA at any time after the approval of an EU MA; however, a delay in submission may affect the delivery of a decision within the specified timelines. Where a submission is made within five days of a positive opinion issued by the CHMP, the MHRA will aim to determine the Great Britain MA as soon as possible after European Commission approval, and by day 67 at the latest, provided that the European Commission decision has been received. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of MAs made by the EMA and certain other regulators when determining an application for a new Great Britain MA.
The MHRA also offers a 150-day assessment timeline for all high quality applications for a UK, Great Britain or Northern Ireland MA. The 150-day timeline does not include a “clock-off” period which may occur if issues arise or points require clarification following an initial assessment of the application. Such issues should be addressed within a 60-day period, although extensions may be granted in exceptional cases.
Early Access to Medicines Scheme
The early access to medicines scheme, or EAMS, applies in relation to patients with life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions and aims to give such patients access to unauthorized medicines, when there is a clear unmet medical need. Under EAMS, the MHRA will undertake a two-step evaluation process of a medicine, which includes a promising innovative medicine designation (an indication that a product may be eligible for EAMS based on early clinical data) and a scientific opinion on the risks and benefits of the medicine based on data gathered from the patients who will benefit from the medicine. A positive EAMS scientific opinion is valid for one year (which can be renewed) and regular updates must be provided to the MHRA following such positive opinion.
Orphan Designation
Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan designation to the EU process has applied in Great Britain. There is now no pre-MA orphan designation (as there is in the EU) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an application for a UK or Great Britain MA. The criteria for orphan designation are the same as in the EU, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g. there must be no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the EU, and the prevalence of the condition must be no more than 5 in 10,000 persons in Great Britain).
U.S. Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
We collect, store, transmit and process sensitive and confidential data and information, including health information, and personal data. As we seek to expand our business, we are, and will increasingly become, subject to numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations, rules and government and industry standards relating to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of sensitive and personal information in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The regulatory framework for data privacy, data security and data transfers worldwide is rapidly evolving, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues.
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of health information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act), and their implementing regulations impose obligations on covered entities, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, as well as business associates that provide services involving the use or disclosure of personal health information to or on behalf of covered entities. These obligations, such as mandatory contractual terms, relate to safeguarding the privacy and security of protected health information. Many states also have laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. In addition, many states and foreign countries in which we operate have laws that protect the privacy and security of sensitive and personal information. Certain of these laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other.

Human capital
 As of February 28, 2023, we had 70 full-time employees and 2 part-time employees, of which 13 have M.D. (or its equivalent) Ph.D. or J.D. degrees. Within our workforce, 55 employees are engaged in research and development and 17 are engaged in business development, finance, legal and general management and administration. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of equity-based compensation awards in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
