Item 1.  Business
Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of immunotherapeutics based on our proprietary arenavirus platform that is designed to target and amplify T cell and immune responses to fight diseases. Our replicating and non-replicating technologies are engineered to induce robust and durable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and pathogen-neutralizing antibodies. We believe that our technologies can meaningfully leverage the human immune system for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes by inducing CD8+ T cell response levels previously not achieved by other immunotherapy approaches.
We are building a proprietary immuno-oncology pipeline by targeting oncoviral cancer antigens, self-antigens and next-generation antigens. Our oncology portfolio includes three disclosed programs, HB-200, HB-300 and HB-700, all of which use our replicating technology. HB-200 is in clinical development for the treatment of Human Papillomavirus 16-positive (HPV16+) cancers in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial. HB-300, in development for the treatment of prostate cancer, is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, which opened for enrollment of patients in the first quarter of 2023. HB-700, which has been partnered with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (collectively referred to as Roche), is in preclinical development for the treatment of KRAS mutated cancers, including lung, colorectal and pancreatic cancers.
Our strategic priority is the development of our oncology portfolio, but we plan to continue developing infectious disease therapies in partnership with other companies. Our Hepatitis B (HBV) program, HB-400, and our HIV program, HB-500, are developed in a partnership with Gilead Sciences Inc. (Gilead). We have decided not to invest further into any other infectious disease program at this time.
Platform
Our differentiated platform is based on engineered arenaviruses that are designed to activate the natural immune defense mechanism to trigger potent and target-specific T cell and B cell immunity. Arenaviruses have been used for decades as a preclinical tool to study CD8+ T cell responses. Our cofounder, Rolf Zinkernagel, was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his arenavirus-based work on how CD8+ T cells recognize virus-infected cells. We believe that arenaviruses have several key advantages which give them the characteristics of an optimal immunotherapy, including:

● | ability to induce a robust CD8+ T cell response by directly targeting and activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, which are the most efficient antigen presenting cells of the body;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ability to induce a robust antibody response to disease specific target antigens;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reduced neutralization of vector specific antibodies, which facilitates potential for repeat administration;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | do not require an adjuvant to stimulate the immune system; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | have been observed to be well tolerated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe we are the first to reengineer arenaviruses for therapeutic purposes. Our systemic and reproduceable approach features two technologies capable of delivering disease-specific antigens for the prevention and treatment of disease. Our non-replicating technology is designed to induce a strong immune response for prophylactic and therapeutic use against infectious disease. Our replicating technology is engineered to produce an even more powerful immune response, which we are currently exploring in oncology indications. In preclinical studies, our replicating technology was able to reprogram the immune system such that more than half of the body’s CD8+ T cells focused on a specific 

6



cancer self-antigen target without observed serious adverse events. We have designed our platform to be modular in nature in order to allow substitution of antigens to target a broad range of infectious diseases and cancers. We have a robust intellectual property portfolio for our suite of arenaviruses with exclusive rights in issued patents and patent applications related to our non-replicating technology and exclusive and joint rights in issued patents and patent applications for our replicating technology. We believe the breadth and depth of our intellectual property portfolio is a strategic asset that has the potential to provide us with a significant competitive advantage.
We believe that our arenavirus platform approach gives us a unique and powerful way to tap into the biology of the immune system and reprogram it by instructing APCs, such as dendritic cells, to express antigens that direct the immune system to the desired targets. Our product candidates are designed to deliver full length proteins to activate T cells and B cells to produce a robust immune response through natural means, avoiding the use of artificial ex vivo constructs such as CAR-T cells and related approaches that bypass the immune system’s normal control mechanisms. Although these latter approaches have shown clinical efficacy, they have the potential to cause life threatening side effects, including cytokine release syndrome. In addition, we believe that our immunotherapy approach is simpler, more straightforward and cost effective to manufacture and administer than CAR-T cells or other patient derived cellular approaches.
Oncology Pipeline Highlights
The HB-200 program is our first program in oncology and the first clinical exploration of our replicating technology. The HB-200 program is comprised of potential therapeutic agents for people with cancers caused by the Human Papillomavirus (HPV), specifically HPV16+.
HPV is estimated to cause about 5% of the worldwide burden of cancer. This includes approximately 99% of cases in cervical, up to 60% of head and neck, 70% of vaginal and 88% of anal cancers. Prevalence and recent studies have shown that approximately 70% of cancers of the tonsil and tongue base and the majority of cervical and anal cancers may be linked to HPV. It is estimated that the yearly incidence of metastatic head and neck cancers in Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States will be 44,000 by 2030. Tumors caused by HPV are referred to as HPV-positive tumors (HPV+) and can be characterized by their expression of proteins from the HPV genome, particularly the viral E6 and E7 proteins. These two proteins are expressed in tumors but are absent in normal cells, which makes them ideal target candidates for immunotherapy; however, to date, there are no therapeutically approved agents directed against these targets.
HPV16+ cancers include cancers of the head, neck, anus, vagina, cervix and penis. Based on a market research study we commissioned from an independent third party, we believe that in developed countries, approximately 70,000 patients annually are newly diagnosed with HPV16+ head and neck cancer. Each year, approximately 30,000 of these patients present with metastatic disease and an additional 10,000 patients progress to the recurrent and metastatic stages of the disease.
The HB-200 program encompasses our arenaviral-based immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic cancers caused by HPV16+. These arenaviral-based immunotherapies include

1. | HB-201 single-vector therapy: sequential injections of HB-201 (E7E6 fusion protein derived from HPV16 encoded in a Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) vector);
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | HB-202/HB-201 dual-vector therapy: alternating sequential injections of HB-201 and HB-202 (the same E7E6 fusion protein encoded in a Pichinde Virus (PICV) vector).
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In preclinical studies, HB-201, as a monotherapy, was observed to suppress tumor growth and eliminated up to 40% of HPV+ tumors. HB-201 generated a strong and durable T cell response with successfully treated animals demonstrating resistance to a tumor rechallenge. Based on these preliminary results, we believe that treating patients with HB-201 has the potential to both control metastatic disease and prevent relapse.

In December 2019, we opened the HB-200 Phase 1/2 trial (NCT04180215), investigating both Phase 1 dose optimization and Phase 2 dose expansion in a single trial. During the initial 10 months of the trial, the HB-201 single-vector therapy was studied through escalating doses. Starting in October 2020, enrollment into the HB-202/HB-201 alternating sequential dual-vector therapy began, representing a parallel dose escalation.
In November 2021, interim Phase 1 data on HB-201 single-vector therapy and HB-202/HB-201 dual-vector therapy for advanced/metastatic HPV16+ cancers showed promising anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability. The interim data were derived from 62 patients who received either HB-201 single-vector therapy or HB-202/HB-201 dual-vector therapy for advanced/metastatic HPV16+ cancers. In June 2022, additional data on HB-201 single-vector therapy and HB-202/HB-201 dual-vector therapy and conclusions from the Phase 1 part of the Phase 1/2 trial were released. The data was derived from 68 patients with advanced HPV16+ cancers, including 54 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This data demonstrated responses as well as stable disease in some head and neck cancer patients who failed prior standard of care therapy, platinum therapy: PD(L)1 inhibitor, or both. We believe that these early-stage data establish proof of concept for our replicating immunotherapy in oncology.
The interim Phase 1 data released in November 2021 enabled decisions on Phase 2 clinical plans for target tumor type as well as recommended schedule and route of administration for HB-200:

● | IV administration was observed to be superior to IT administration; therefore, the IT route has been discontinued and only IV is being used in Phase 2;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The initial Q3W dosing schedule was observed to be superior to Q2W; therefore, the Q2W regimen arm has been discontinued and the Q3W dosing is being used in Phase 2; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | As the majority of data accrued has been from HNSCC patients, the Phase 2 target tumor type was decided to be HNSCC.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the interim data reported in November 2021, the June 2022 data enabled further decisions on the Phase 2 part of the trial:

● | While promising anti-tumor activity was shown in both groups, alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201 demonstrated superior tumor response with 56% of treated patients showing target lesion shrinkage compared to 38% of HB-201 recipients. In addition, decreases in visceral lesions were predominantly seen in patients who received alternating dual-vector therapy: 59% of patients on HB-202/HB-201 compared to 18% on HB-201;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The HB-202/HB-201 alternating dual-vector therapy demonstrated an 80% disease control rate, which compares favorably to historical disease control rates achieved by pembrolizumab in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC patients, specifically 35% overall and 40% in the HPV+ subset, based on peer-reviewed published data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | While both HB-201 and alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201 were highly immunogenic, HB-202/HB-201 induced superior immune response with 32% of recipients achieving tumor-specific T cell levels greater than 5% of the circulating T cell pool.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the safety profile, anti-tumor activity and T cell response data observed in the Phase 1 dose escalation part, the Phase 2 expansion portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial is evaluating HB-202/HB-201 in combination with pembrolizumab in 1st line patients with advanced or metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) using a two-step combination dose escalation. First, a small cohort of patients was dosed with HB-201 single-vector therapy in combination with pembrolizumab as a safety lead-in. Second, the alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201 therapy at a lower dose than RP2D was evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab, before beginning the current alternating dual-vector therapy at RP2D in combination with pembrolizumab. The Phase 2 portion of the trial is also open for enrollment of patients with second line and greater advanced/metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC for treatment with a 

8



combination of HB-202/HB-201 and pembrolizumab. Enrollment of those patients is also proceeding in the unrandomized Phase 2 dose expansion part of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial.
In July 2022, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted our Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for HB-300 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. A Drug Master File was also accepted, facilitating reduced cycle time between completion of preclinical studies and clinical entry of our pipeline projects. In February 2023, we opened a Phase 1/2 trial (NCT05553639) for enrollment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
In October 2022, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the Roche Collaboration Agreement) with Roche to (i) grant Roche an exclusive license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize our pre-clinical HB-700 cancer program, an arenaviral immunotherapeutic for KRAS-mutated cancers, and (ii) grant Roche an exclusive option right to exclusively license for research, development manufacturing and commercialization, a second, novel arenaviral immunotherapeutic program targeting undisclosed cancer antigens. Pursuant to the Roche Collaboration Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $25.0 million and are eligible to receive up to approximately $930 million in potential future success-based milestone payments for both programs, plus tiered royalties. As of December 31, 2022, we have received from Roche the non-refundable upfront payment of $25.0 million. In the first quarter of 2023, we reported the achievement of the first milestone event under the Roche agreement, triggering a milestone payment of $10.0 million.
Infectious Disease Pipeline Highlights
While our strategic priority is the development of our oncology portfolio, we believe that our platform is also uniquely positioned to provide value from the prophylactic and therapeutic use against infectious diseases. We plan to continue developing infectious disease therapies in partnership with other companies. 
Our collaboration with Gilead to develop functional cures for chronic HBV and HIV infections has become our main driver of our infectious disease pipeline progress. We entered into our collaboration and licensing agreement (the Gilead Collaboration Agreement) with Gilead in June 2018. To date, we have received $46.2 million in upfront and milestone payments and $40.9 million of cost reimbursements from Gilead. Both programs have completed preclinical research and are being progressed towards entry into Phase 1 clinical trials.
In January 2023, we announced the achievement of a $5.0 million milestone payment for the completion and delivery of a regulatory support package for Gilead’s Phase 1 clinical trial of the HBV therapeutic vaccine developed under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement. The first participant in the Phase 1 clinical trial being conducted by Gilead is expected to be dosed in 2023. The preclinical data on the HBV vaccine as a potential component for a curative regimen were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) in November 2022 and selected by AASLD as a “Best of the Liver Meeting” highlight. Gilead is solely responsible for further development and commercialization of the HBV product candidate.
In February 2022, we signed an amended and restated collaboration agreement (the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement) which revised the terms only for the HIV program, whereby we will take on development responsibilities for the HIV program candidate through a Phase 1b clinical trial and Gilead will provide funding through a combination of an initiation payment of $15.0 million, a milestone payment of $5.0 million and equity contributions of up to $35.0 million. Gilead retains an exclusive right (“the Option”) to take back the rights for the HIV program, including further research, development and commercialization. If Gilead elects to exercise the Option, we will be entitled to a $10.0 million program completion fee. 
Our first product candidate, HB-101, through which we established proof of concept for our non-replicating arenaviral technology, is a potential vaccine for the prevention of CMV disease. CMV infection poses a considerable risk to infants in utero, as well as immune-compromised individuals, such as solid organ transplant recipients.
In our Phase 1 clinical trial, reviewed in the April 2020 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases, HB-101 was well-tolerated and elicited strong CMV-specific immune responses in all 42 of the treatment arm volunteers.

Importantly, we observed robust CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, as well as CMV-neutralizing antibody responses, without meaningful vector-neutralizing antibody responses. In our Phase 2 trial, we proceeded to assess safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of HB-101 in individuals receiving a kidney transplant from live donors to measure the decrease of post-transplant viremia. In March 2023, we reported final data from our Phase 2 trial, showing that HB-101 induced CMV neutralizing antibodies after at least two doses at levels that were similar to those observed in the Phase 1 study. All patients who received three doses of HB-101, and for whom viable T cell assays were available, exhibited a CMV-specific T cell immune response. In the efficacy analysis, a lower incidence of CMV viremia was observed for patients who received three doses of HB-101 compared to patients who received three doses of placebo. The incidence of CMV infection, CMV disease, and the need for antiviral treatment post-transplant were not reduced for patients receiving only two doses of HB-101 compared to placebo. Overall, the small numbers and lower-than-expected incidence of CMV disease limit conclusion regarding efficacy.
In line with our strategy to focus on oncology programs and to pursue infectious disease programs only in partnerships, we decided to not further invest into the HB-101 program.
Leadership
We are led by a team of highly experienced executives, clinicians, and scientists with focused and translational expertise in oncology, immunology, vaccinology, clinical development, and commercialization. Our Chief Executive Officer, Joern Aldag, was previously the Chief Executive Officer of uniQure, a company that under his leadership pioneered the approval of the first gene therapy product. The fundamental discoveries underlying our arenavirus platform originated with our co-founders, Nobel laureate Rolf Zinkernagel, M.D., and Daniel Pinschewer, M.D., an internationally recognized arenavirus expert who serves as Scientific Advisor to our Chief Executive Officer.
Our Pipeline
We are leveraging our modular arenavirus platform to develop the following product candidates for multiple cancers and infectious diseases:

Via our existing collaboration with DarwinHealth, a New York City-based bioinformatics company pioneering novel bioinformatic approaches, we are also pursuing the development of “off-the-shelf” cancer therapies by identifying the next generation cancer testis antigens, which are tumor associated antigens that are generally not expressed in normal tissue.
Background
Immune System Function: Antigen Presentation by Dendritic and Other Antigen Presenting Cells
The immune system is designed to protect the human body from infections and cancers. Infections can be generally defined as the proliferation of foreign microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites in a patient’s body resulting in clinical manifestations of disease. Cancer can be generally defined as the uncontrolled proliferation of native cells resulting in disease. In both cases, the immune system recognizes and destroys microorganisms, infected cells and cancers by targeting specific proteins, or antigens, as well as their immunogenic sub-parts, which are referred to as epitopes.
The innate immune system is the body’s first line of defense and enables a rapid, short-lived and nonspecific response. In contrast, the adaptive immune system utilizes highly specialized immune cells called lymphocytes that have been selected to recognize specific foreign antigens. Although it takes longer to mobilize, the adaptive immune system is capable of providing long-term, more effective immunity against specific pathogens by being able to recall prior antigen exposure and mounting a very powerful and specific response.
In order for the adaptive immune system to function effectively, the innate immune system must first present disease specific antigens to a subset of lymphocytes called T cells in order to “instruct” the T cells as to which antigen they must recognize. The T cell population consists of CD8+ T cells, those that kill virus infected and cancer cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins, and CD4+ T cells that help or stimulate additional parts of the immune system such as B cells that produce antibodies. Antigen presentation to T cells is mediated by APCs, such as dendritic cells.
Immunotherapy and Current Limitations
The clinical application of immunotherapy in the context of managing infectious diseases and cancers is distinctly different. The approach taken for infectious diseases is commonly that of “vaccination”, whereby the aim is to prevent onset of disease by administering a derivative of the disease-causing agent to a healthy individual. In contrast, for cancer, the approach is typically one of therapeutic intervention in patients with active disease.
Infectious disease and cancer immunotherapies represent areas of medicine with high potential for prophylactic and therapeutic benefit and have generated significant interest and investment from leading biopharmaceutical companies. Data from ongoing industry and academic research have demonstrated the potential clinical benefit for patients in a range of infectious disease and cancer settings. Several immunotherapy products have been approved by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and other foreign regulatory agencies. However, despite ongoing development efforts and successes, we believe that the current immunotherapies are limited by several factors, including:
Lack of Robust CD8+ T cell Response. APCs, like Dendritic cells, are the most efficient antigen presenting cells of the body and the natural mechanism by which to induce a robust CD8+ T cell response to fight the disease. However, we do not believe there are any existing immunotherapies that have the ability to independently and directly deliver full length proteins to target and activate dendritic cells to present antigens directly to CD8+ T cells. This limitation prevents them from inducing a robust and durable CD8+ T cell response.
Presence of Virus Neutralizing Antibodies and Pre-Existing Immunity. Nearly all viral vectors used to deliver antigens elicit neutralizing antibodies against both the desired target and the vectors themselves. In some cases, these circulating antibodies can be present before treatment is commenced owing to prior virus exposure. The presence of pre-existing vector neutralizing antibodies can reduce or eliminate the viral vector’s ability to elicit CD8+ T cell and antibody responses to the desired antigen. For example, a significant proportion of the global 

11



population carries adenovirus 5 neutralizing antibodies from natural infection which can affect vector immunogenicity. Even in the absence of pre-existing immunity, if virus neutralizing antibodies are induced in response to immunization, such as is the case with recombinant adenovirus or poxvirus based vaccines, repeat doses administered to the patient may also be rendered ineffective or impractical.
Safety and Toxicity Concerns. Some immunotherapies, such as engineered T cells (CAR-T and TCR-T), use artificial constructs that bypass normal control mechanisms of the immune system. As a result, these approaches have the risk of causing life threatening immune reactions, including cytokine release syndrome, and can have various other toxicity concerns.
Clinical Application. Two common limiting factors of many immunotherapies are the inability to deliver full length proteins directly to antigen presenting cells and the inability to be administered systemically. The former limitation restricts these therapies to being patient specific as they can only deliver smaller proteins such as neoantigens and it furthermore prevents an “off-the-shelf” approach. The latter restricts their application only to tumors that are amenable to intratumoral administration, as is the case for oncolytic viruses.
Handling and Manufacturing. Ex vivo approaches, such as CAR-T, require CD8+ T lymphocytes to be isolated from cancer patients, manipulated, substantially expanded and delivered back into the patient. This represents a costly, time consuming and substantially more complex approach.
Unlike with cancer treatment, immunotherapies in the context of infectious diseases, commonly stimulate an antibody response that is dependent on the presence of CD4+ T cells. We believe that a vaccine approach that can generate the combination of CD8+ T cells with an antibody response offers a solution to optimally mobilize the immune response and potentially overcome many of the limitations that exist with current approaches.
Our Technology Platform
Our proprietary platform is based on engineering arenaviruses to carry and deliver virus specific or tumor specific genes to APCs, such as dendritic cells, which are natural activators of CD8+ T cells. Arenaviruses have been used for decades to stimulate potent CD8+ T cells responses in preclinical research. Our cofounder, Rolf Zinkernagel, was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his arenavirus based work on how CD8+ T cells recognize virus infected cells.
Arenaviruses have several important advantages, which we believe represent the optimal characteristics for an antigen specific immunotherapy. Specifically, they:

● | have the ability to induce a robust CD8+ T cell response by directly targeting and activating APCs, such as dendritic cells, which are the most efficient antigen presenting cells of the body;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | have the ability to induce a robust antibody response to disease specific target antigens;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | are not efficiently neutralized by vector specific antibodies, which may facilitate repeat administration;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | do not require an adjuvant to stimulate the immune system; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | have been observed to be well tolerated in preclinical studies and clinical trials.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The arenavirus family is comprised of over 30 currently known species, many of which we believe have potential prophylactic and therapeutic applications. We believe we are the first to reengineer arenaviruses for the prevention and treatment of disease. We have created two types of viral technologies capable of delivering disease specific antigens: a replication defective vector, and a replication competent but attenuated vector.

12



Our non-replicating and replicating technologies utilize both LCMV and PICV, two of over 30 species of arenaviruses, as a backbone of the product candidates we are developing. LCMV is principally carried and secreted by wild mice, with human infection being secondary to such exposure and uncommon. Approximately 2% to 5% of individuals in industrialized countries have circulating antibodies against LCMV, which indicates prior exposure in these individuals. Individuals infected with LCMV typically remain asymptomatic or may present with a nonspecific and self-resolving flu-like illness. PICV is principally carried and secreted by Colombian rice rats (oryzomys albigularis) and is a nonpathogenic virus that does not cause disease in humans.
Non-Replicating Technology Overview
Our proprietary non-replicating technology disables arenavirus replication by substituting one of its four structural genes with the gene for a desired antigen. The modified, non-replicating arenavirus is able to directly infect individual APCs, such as dendritic cells and deliver proteins that serve as antigens to activate the immune system but is not able to replicate and infect additional cells in the body.
Advantages of Non-Replicating Technology
Based on the preclinical and clinical data that we have generated to date, we believe our non-replicating technology supports the benefits of our arenavirus platform approach. Specifically, in preclinical studies and clinical trials this technology has demonstrated that it is well tolerated and has the following additional benefits:
Robust CD8+ T cell Response as Well as Pathogen Neutralization Response. Our non-replicating technology is designed to induce a robust CD8+ T cell and pathogen neutralizing response to fight disease. We believe our technology results in a prophylactic and immuno-therapeutic approach with potential for greater potency than existing prophylactic treatments.
Immunological Memory and Protection Against Challenge. Our non-replicating technology has shown the ability to trigger a robust and long term CD8+ T cell response of at least 12 months in humans. Furthermore, in various animal models non-replicating vector immunization resulted in protection against infectious challenge.
Reduced Neutralization of Vector Specific Antibodies. The reduced neutralization of vector specific antibodies facilitates repeat administration.
​
Replicating Overview
Our proprietary replicating technology was designed to provide the beneficial properties of our non-replicating technology but to induce an even more robust immune response. Unlike naturally occurring arenaviruses which have two genomic segments, our replicating constructs were engineered to have three segments to allow for the introduction of genomic space in which to insert additional target antigens of choice. As a result of the larger genome the virus’ ability to replicate is reduced (attenuated).
Advantages of our Replicating Technology
Based on our preclinical data, we believe our replicating technology shows all the benefits of the non-replicating technology and the following additional benefits:
Quantitatively: Even More Robust CD8+ T Cell Response. In animal studies, our replicating technology has shown to induce a CD8+ T cell response that directs more than 50% of a body’s T cells, which is approximately ten times greater than the response induced by our non-replicating technology, to focus on a single target of choice. Similar data have been demonstrated in our Phase 1/2 clinical study. We believe our technology results in an immunotherapeutic approach with potential for greater potency than existing therapeutic treatments.
Qualitatively: Immunological Memory and Protection Against Challenge. Our replicating technology has shown the ability to trigger a long term CD8+ T cell response. Furthermore, in various animal models 

13



replicating immunization resulted in complete tumor remission after a single treatment and protection against a cancer re-challenge months after primary treatment.
The additional benefits noted above are attributable to our technology’s ability to replicate. This allows it to infect not only APCs, such as dendritic cells, but also lymphoid stromal cells, which are immune support cells found in lymph nodes and the spleen. Infection of lymphoid stromal cells results in the release of a signaling protein which further drives the proliferation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells. This mechanism has the potential to generate ten-fold more antigen specific CD8+ T cells as compared to viral delivery systems that are unable to trigger this pathway. Furthermore, we believe our replicating technologies may also be synergistic with other approved immuno-oncology agents and currently are conducting a clinical trial of our replicating technology in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.
In additional preclinical models, including a mouse melanoma model and a cancer testis self-antigen cancer model, we again demonstrated the ability of sequential administration of replicating PICV and LCMV constructs to direct up to 50% of a body’s T cells to focus on a single target of choice.
Non-Replicating Preclinical Data
We believe our preclinical data support the development of our non-replicating technology for prophylactic and therapeutic uses for infectious disease.
HIV Model
A third-party preclinical study was conducted in a monkey model of HIV infection using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Ten monkeys were treated with an adenoviral vector carrying the SIV Env protein. The expression of the SIV Env protein is meant to prime the animal’s immune system to detect and attack SIV. From earlier work, this initial adenoviral-prophylactic immunization on its own was shown not to prevent SIV infection. Monkeys were then boosted eight weeks later with our non-replicating LCMV vector encoding SIV Env. The ten monkeys were also treated with vectors encoding no relevant genes, identified as the null group below. Starting at week six, both groups were challenged with weekly SIV injections for 12 weeks. The dosing regimen of the study is shown in Figure 1 below. As depicted in the Figure 2 below, the non-replicating LCMV-Env vaccination resulted in over 70% of monkeys being SIV free at the end of the study, as compared to less than 20% in the null group.

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hepatitis B Virus Model
In addition to the HIV model, we explored the ability of our non-replicating vectors to induce immune responses against hepatitis B core, HBc, and hepatitis B surface, HBs, antigens. In our study, we observed that a non-replicating LCMV vector expressing both HBc and HBs was able to generate significant CD8+ T cell responses against both proteins. These data indicate that a single dose of a non-replicating LCMV vector expressing HBV antigens elicits robust cellular immunity against both encoded proteins delivered in a single vector. We believe that non-replicating vector based immunotherapy may form an important cornerstone of a potential cure for the estimated 350 million people worldwide who are persistently infected with HBV.
We believe that the combination of our HIV and HBV preclinical and subsequent non-replicating vector clinical data facilitated our Gilead collaboration.
Replicating Vector Preclinical Data
We have conducted several preclinical studies assessing the efficacy of our replicating technology, for both LCMV and PICV constructs, carrying the HPV specific E7E6 fusion protein through intravenous (IV) and intratumoral (IT) administration. Mice treated with the replicating vectors showed no evidence of toxicity. In a mouse model of HPV-induced cancer (TC1), we observed that a single intravenous administration of replicating LCMV significantly suppressed and delayed tumor growth while a single IT administration of replicating LCMV eliminated the tumor in approximately half of the mice (top left panel). IV administration of replicating PICV eliminated the tumor in 

15



approximately half of the mice, by the same definition, while IT administration of replicating PICV significantly suppressed and delayed tumor growth (bottom left panel). These mice had complete remission without recurrence for at least six months, which represents over 25% of a mouse’s lifetime (right panel). In contrast, replicating vectors carrying non-tumor specific antigens, such as GFP, demonstrated no anti-tumor activity. In these studies, we also observed resistance to a tumor re-challenge after six months (right panel). ​

We have also performed “tracking” experiments wherein we observed that while our intravenous replicating vectors travel to APCs, such as dendritic cells, the reprogrammed antigen CD8+ T cells travel to tumors. We illustrated this in an EG7-OVA model, which analyzed subcutaneous tumors for the presence of antigen specific CD8+T cells. In mice injected with a replicating vector, histopathology showed clear evidence of strong CD8+ T cell infiltration, as shown by the brown staining in the pictures below.

​
We observed similar results in a more aggressive B16F10 melanoma mouse model. In this experiment B16F10 malignant cells were introduced into the tail vein of mice, resulting in lung metastases within three weeks. Ten days after the introduction of B16F10, a replicating vector expressing Trp2, a melanoma antigen, was introduced intravenously 

16



leading to a significant delay in disease progression. Similarly, in subcutaneously growing B16F10 tumors treated intravenously, histopathology showed clear evidence of strong CD8+ T cell infiltration.

​
When we combined the above two experiments, by initially introducing B16F10 malignant cells subcutaneously, and then intravenously, we achieved both a localized subcutaneous tumor and metastatic lung lesions. Subsequent administration of our intratumoral replicating vector demonstrated both a localized response, through subcutaneous tumor shrinkage, and systemic response, through clearance of lung metastases. The long-term survivor mice were then rechallenged with B16F10 several months after remission with no observed subsequent tumor regrowth.

​
Advantages of sequential administration of replicating PICV and replicating LCMV
We have observed increased antitumor activity and survival of animals that received sequential administration of replicating PICV and replicating LCMV in a preclinical mastocytoma model. In this model, tumor cells expressed a cancer testis self-antigen known as P1A. In the absence of treatment, tumors grew rapidly and most of the mice died by day 25. When given a first dose with a replicating LCMV P1A vector, followed by a second dose with the same vector, there was a delay in tumor growth of approximately ten days and an increase in survival rates, with some mice surviving to almost 100 days (left panel below). In contrast, mice that were treated first with replicating PICV P1A followed by a second dose with a different arenavirus, replicating LCMV P1A, had an average tumor growth delay of approximately 25 days and in 18% of the mice the tumors were eliminated, and they survived beyond the 160 days of the study. 

17



Furthermore, and as seen in our other studies, mice with eliminated tumors demonstrated resistance to a tumor rechallenge (right panel below).

Our Product Candidates
HB-200 Program for the Treatment of HPV16+ Cancers
Our HB-200 program consists of two immunotherapeutics targeting HPV16+ cancers.
HB-201 is a replicating LCMV-based product candidate expressing the E7E6 fusion protein specific to HPV16+ cells and being developed for the treatment of HPV16+ cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cervical and anal cancers. HB-201 is being evaluated as both monotherapy and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor.
HB-202 is a replicating PICV-based product candidate expressing the same E7E6 fusion protein as HB-201. HB-202 is being evaluated as an alternating sequential vector therapy with HB-201, so called “HB-202/HB-201 therapy”. 
The “HB-200 program” encompasses our arenaviral-based immunotherapies for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic cancers caused by HPV16+. These two arenaviral-based immunotherapy regimens include:

● | HB-201 single-vector therapy: sequential injections of HB-201 (E7E6 fusion protein derived from HPV16 encoded in an LCMV vector);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | HB-202/HB-201 dual-vector therapy: alternating sequential injections of HB-201 and HB-202 (the same E7E6 fusion protein encoded in a PICV vector).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HPV-Positive Cancers
HPV is estimated to cause about 5% of cancers worldwide, including approximately 99% of cervical cancers, up to 60% of HNSCC, 70% of vaginal cancers and 88% of anal cancers, the majority of which are caused by the HPV serotype 16. While most infections with HPV are cleared from the body with no lasting consequences, in some cases, HPV DNA becomes integrated into chromosomal DNA. When host cells take up this DNA, they express the HPV E6 and E7 proteins. The expression of these proteins can lead to alterations in cell cycle control, which in turn predisposes these cells to become cancerous.
While the rates of HNSCC from causes such as smoking and alcohol are decreasing, the rates of HPV16+ HNSCC are increasing. HNSCC is the sixth most common form of cancer. Each year, HNSCC is diagnosed in more than 600,000 people worldwide, with 65,000 new cases and more than 14,500 deaths occurring in the United States alone. 

18



HNSCC includes tumors of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx. The current standard of care for HNSCC is the same regardless of HPV status. Treatment typically involves immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation and surgery, the precise regimen varying based on the Stage of cancer and responses to prior therapies. These treatments are associated with acute and long-term effects including mucositis, swallowing dysfunction, dry mouth, and dental problems. The overall survival time for patients with advanced metastatic HNSCC progressing on platinum and checkpoint-based therapies is less than six months. While there is no T cell therapy approved for HNSCC, retrospective analyses have shown that patients’ outcomes are improved for those with high levels of CD8+ T cells in tumors as compared to patients with low levels. In many cases, the survival rate of patients with higher levels is more than double that of patients with lower levels of CD8+ T cells.
We believe that HB-200 has potential to provide beneficial treatment to persons with HPV16+ HNSCC, in the post-standard of care therapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in earlier line (e.g., 1st line or 2nd line) therapy. We believe that success in developing an effective therapy for HPV16+ HNSCC could support the potential of our product candidates to be effective for all HPV16+ cancers, regardless of the cancer’s tissue of origin.
Our Solution HB-200 Programs: HB-201 and HB-202
Both HB-201 (LCMV) and HB-202 (PICV) are replicating based product candidates expressing a non-oncogenic but highly antigenic E7E6 fusion protein from HPV16. In animal models, HB-201 was observed to be highly immunogenic, resulting in a robust CD8+ T cell response. Based on the levels of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells induced by HB-201 in preclinical models, notably when compared to therapeutic levels induced by other published approaches including adoptive cell therapies, as observed in separately designed and conducted third-party clinical trials, we believe that HB-201 single-vector therapy has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to patients across the broader HPV16+ cancer setting. We have observed strong immunogenicity and robust antitumor activity in mouse models for HB-201 alone as well as for the sequential administration of HB-201 and HB-202.
Relevance of E6 and E7 as Tumor Antigens
Integration of HPV viral sequences into the genome of a cell can result in the introduction of E6 and E7 oncoproteins. They are present in cells that become cancerous and play a critical role in interfering with cellular processes and interrupting normal tumor suppressor functions.
Profiling of immune cells isolated from patients with HPV16+ tumors has identified E6 and E7 specific T cells, indicating that the E6 and E7 proteins are immunogenic, meaning that they trigger antigen specific CD8+ T cell responses. Because both E6 and E7 are highly expressed in tumor cells and are absent in normal cells, they are ideal candidates for use as targets of tumor directed active immunization.
HB-201 Preclinical Results
The ability of HB-201 to suppress tumor growth was tested in a TC1 mouse model of a transplantable HPV16+ E6/E7 expressing tumor. HB-201 was administered either intravenously or intratumorally to animals when tumor volume was approximately 100mm3. In both cases, as depicted in the figures below, single doses of HB-201 led to suppression of tumor growth in a statistically significant manner (p < 0.05) in all treated mice, and intratumoral administrations resulted in an approximately 40% long-term survival rate. When these long-term survivor mice were rechallenged with the same tumor six months later, no new tumor growth was detected. We believe that these results demonstrate the potential for HB-201 to be active both in treating primary tumors and also controlling metastatic and recurring disease. 
Furthermore, we have observed that the dose of HB-201 strongly correlated with both immunogenicity, as depicted in the left side of the figure below, and antitumor activity, as depicted in the right side of the figure below. We believe that this indicates that antitumor activity is directly linked to immunogenicity. Specifically, low doses of HB-201 containing as few as 100 replication-competent vector (RCV) particles per dose suppressed tumor growth by more than 50% as compared to untreated tumors. Dosing with the highest three doses of HB-201, ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 RCV particles per dose, led to greater suppression of tumor growth. These data suggest that the maximal effective dose 

19



was already achieved at the lower of those three doses, or 10,000 RCV particles per dose. All doses of HB-201 were well tolerated in this model.

​
HB-202 Preclinical Studies
HB-202, like HB-201, is directed against HPV16+ E6/E7 tumors. In a mouse model of HPV16+ E6/E7 tumors, single doses of HB-202 were shown to be similarly effective as single doses of HB-201 when administered both intravenously and intratumorally. Also, as in HB-201, long-term survivor mice were uniformly resistant to re-challenge at six months. The results of our preclinical studies of HB-202 are depicted below.


20

​
Additionally, we have observed that if HB-202 and HB-201 are administered sequentially, activity levels, which tend to indicate effectiveness, are significantly superior to those observed after repeated administration of either one alone.
Combination with Other Immunotherapy Modalities
In April 2022, we presented data at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting expanding our preclinical combination data. Specifically, preclinical data accepted for poster presentation (abstract #4198) demonstrated that the combination of co-stimulatory 4-1BB agonists with arenaviral immunotherapy increased tumor control and resulted in a higher cure rate than arenaviral immunotherapy alone. Co-stimulatory agents, like 4-1BB agonists, are known as accelerators of cancer immunotherapy, because they help induce potent, tumor-specific T cells that can infiltrate and kill tumors. The combination of an arenaviral immunotherapy with a 4-1BB agonistic antibody resulted in complete tumor rejection in 30 % of mice following treatment. Importantly, improved tumor control and cure rates of up to 50 % were also observed with a 4-1BB ligand which was integrated into the arenaviral vector.
A separate preclinical analysis presented at AACR (abstract #3298) offered additional evidence of potential combination with other modalities. In this analysis, replicating arenaviral immunotherapy was sequentially combined with adoptively transferred TCR transgenic T cells, which resulted in tumor cures in all mice receiving combination therapy, with 100 % survival at the end of the experiment (60 days after administration). These data highlight the potential of arenaviral immunotherapies in combination with other treatment modalities beyond PD-1 inhibitors, as well as showcase the versatility of the platform as a potential backbone for various combination immunotherapies.
HB-200 Clinical Trial 
Our oncology product candidates, HB-201 and HB-202, are being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of HPV16+ cancers. 
In December 2019, we opened the HB-200 Phase 1/2 trial, investigating both Phase 1 dose optimization and Phase 2 dose expansions in a single trial. During the initial 10 months of the trial, the HB-201 single-vector therapy was studied through escalating doses. Starting in October 2020, enrollment into the HB-202/HB-201 alternating sequential dual-vector therapy began, representing a parallel dose escalation. The primary endpoint of the Phase 1 part of the Phase 1/2 trial was a recommended Phase 2 dose based on safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included anti-tumor activity as defined by RECIST 1.1, immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability.

21



As a first-in-human trial, the Phase 1 arm of the trial opened to investigate multiple questions for HB-200 program:

● | Route of administration: intravenous (IV) vs. intratumoral (IT);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dose optimization; and
--+-----------------------


● | Dosing schedule: every two weeks (Q2W) or every three weeks (Q3W)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In November 2021, interim Phase 1 data on HB-201 single-vector therapy and HB-202/HB-201 dual-vector therapy for advanced/metastatic HPV16+ cancers showed promising anti-tumor activity and favorable tolerability. The interim data was derived from 62 patients who received either HB-201 single-vector therapy or HB-202/HB-201 dual-vector therapy for advanced/metastatic HPV16+ cancers. Data demonstrated some responses and stable disease in head and neck cancer patients who failed prior standard of care therapy: platinum therapy, PD(L)1 inhibitor, or both.
In addition, the interim Phase 1 data released in November 2021 enabled decisions on Phase 2 clinical plans for target tumor type as well as recommended schedule and route of administration for HB-200:


● | IV administration was observed to be superior to IT administration; therefore, the IT route has been discontinued and IV only is being used in Phase 2;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The initial Q3W dosing schedule was observed to be superior to Q2W; therefore, the Q2W regimen arm has been discontinued and the Q3W dosing is being used in Phase 2;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The majority of data accrued to date has been from HNSCC patients; therefore, the Phase 2 target tumor type is HNSCC.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In June 2022, positive Phase 1 data were presented in a poster presentation (abstract #2517) at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. The data included results from our HB-200 program evaluating single-vector HB-201 and alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201 in advanced HPV16+ head and neck cancer patients. HB-200 was generally well tolerated, rapidly induced a high magnitude of tumor-specific T cells and showed early anti-tumor activity in these difficult-to-treat patients. We also announced the recommended Phase 2 dose 

22



for alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201, which showed superior immune and tumor response compared to single-vector HB-201.
​
Patient Details
In the June 2022 data release, a total of 68 patients with advanced HPV16+ cancers were treated in the Phase 1 trial as of March 31, 2022. Fifty-four patients had advanced HPV16+ head and neck cancers with a median of three prior therapies (range of 1-11), including a checkpoint inhibitor regimen in 50 of the 54.

​
Clinical Biomarker Data
The June 2022 data release included clinical biomarker data on patients who received HB-201 or alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201. These clinical biomarker data included measurements of tumor specific T cells, which are essential in eradicating cancer cells.
While both HB-201 and alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201 were highly immunogenic, HB-202/HB-201 induced superior immune response with 32 % of recipients achieving tumor-specific T cell levels greater than 5 % of the circulating T cell pool (7 % of HB-201 recipients achieved this threshold).

23



​
​
​
Additionally, three of six of biopsied patients showed TILs (i.e. CD8+ T cells infiltrating tumors).

​
Clinical Safety Data
HB-200 Phase 1 results showed HB-200 was generally well tolerated, with comparable safety between the single-vector HB-201 and alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201. The most common treatment-related side effects were flu-like symptoms, with only 8.8 % of patients experiencing treatment-related side effects rated grade 3 or higher. 

24



This favorable tolerability profile in heavily pre-treated patients highlights the potential for combination with checkpoint inhibitors and other agents.
​
​
Clinical Efficacy Data
The poster presented at ASCO provided updated anti-tumor activity on 43 Phase 1 patients with HPV16+ HNSCC who received therapy intravenously every three weeks (Q3W) for the first five doses and every six weeks (Q6W) thereafter, which is the route and frequency selected for further evaluation in Phase 2 cohorts. The 43 patients were comprised of 20 persons who received single-vector HB-201 and 23 who received alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201.

​
In addition to the interim data reported in November 2021, the June 2022 data enabled further decisions on the Phase 2 part of the trial by revealing the following:

● | While promising anti-tumor activity was shown in both groups, alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201 showed superior tumor responses with 56 % of treated patients showing target lesion shrinkage compared to 38 % of HB-201 recipients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25



​

● | In addition, decreases in visceral lesions were predominantly seen in patients who received dual-vector therapy: 59 % of patients on HB-202/HB-201 compared to 18 % on HB-201.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The HB-202/HB-201 dual-vector therapy demonstrated an 80 % disease control rate (DCR), which compares favorably to historical DCRs achieved by pembrolizumab in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC patients, specifically 35 % overall and 40 % in the HPV16+ subset, based on peer-reviewed published data (Mehra R et al. Efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: pooled analysis after long-term follow up in KEYNOTE-012. British J of Cancer. 2018; 119:153-159).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Based on the safety profile, anti-tumor activity and T cell response data observed in the Phase 1 dose escalation part and reported in the June 2022 ASCO poster, the HB-202/HB-201 alternating dual-vector intravenous therapy was selected as the preferred regimen as it induced more robust circulating T cell responses and anti-tumor activity than HB-201 single-vector therapy. Additionally, HB-202/HB-201 dose level three was selected as the RP2D based on the acceptable safety profile and preliminary Phase 1 anti-tumor activity.

26



Therefore, the Phase 2 expansion portion of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial proceeded to evaluate HB-202/HB-201 at the RP2D in combination with pembrolizumab in 1st line patients with advanced or metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC using a two-step combination dose escalation. First, a small cohort of patients was dosed with HB-201 single-vector therapy in combination with pembrolizumab as a safety lead-in. Second, the alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201 therapy at a lower dose than RP2D was evaluated in combination with pembrolizumab, before beginning the alternating dual-vector therapy at RP2D in combination with pembrolizumab.
As communicated in November 2022, more than 20 patients have been dosed in the Phase 2 pembrolizumab combination expansion cohort, including those in the safety run-in, though only a small number of patients had received the RP2D of HB-202/HB-201 with pembrolizumab. More time and additional imaging assessments are required to mature the dataset and inform the next phase of development. We will provide a comprehensive data update in the first half of 2023.
The Phase 2 portion of the trial is also open for enrollment of patients with second line and greater advanced/metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC for treatment with a combination of HB-202/HB-201 and pembrolizumab. Enrollment of those patients is also proceeding in the unrandomized Phase 2 dose expansion part of the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial.
The FDA has granted Fast Track Designation to single-vector HB-201 and alternating dual-vector HB-202/HB-201, both in combination with pembrolizumab, for the treatment of first-line advanced/metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC.
In addition to the ongoing nonrandomized Phase 1/2 clinical trial, in September 2021 we announced a clinical collaboration with Merck & Co., Inc, to study HB-200 in combination with pembrolizumab in a randomized Phase 2 trial of patients with 1st line advanced/metastatic HPV16+ HNSCC. We anticipate making a decision on when to start this Phase 2 clinical trial in 2023.
HB-300 Program for Prostate Cancer
Targeting Self Antigens
We believe that our viral vectors may be appropriate for any antigen where a T cell response may be therapeutically meaningful. We have shown in multiple preclinical models that replicating product candidates are active in generating robust immune responses to tumor self-antigens and that this response results in decreased tumor growth and an increase in survival rates.
Our HB-200 program targets viral antigens associated with tumors induced by HPV16. In these programs, the viral, or non-self nature of the antigens, makes them a natural target for an immunotherapy approach. In addition, we are pursuing the development of product candidates based on our arenavirus platform to target self-antigens, nonviral antigenic proteins that are highly overexpressed in solid tumors or only minimally expressed in normal cells. Because self-antigens are found in certain normal cells as well as tumor cells, the immune system does not typically recognize them as foreign proteins and does not respond to them. This protection of self-antigens from immune system attack is known as immune tolerance. The results obtained by earlier-generation marketed products such as sipuleucel-T, developed as PROVENGE by Dendreon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., have proven that it is possible to overcome immune tolerance and activate the immune system to produce an antitumor response.
Our Solution: HB-300 for Prostate Cancer
We are developing our most advanced self-antigen candidate in this area, HB-300, based on our replicating technology in metastatic, hormone resistant prostate cancer. Prostate cancer provides a unique treatment opportunity for immunotherapy because prostate cancer cells express a number of tumor-specific antigens that serve as potential targets. HB-300 is an alternating, dual-vector replicating arenaviral immunotherapy which uses the Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus and Pichinde Virus as arenaviral backbones, with each expressing two well-defined antigens of prostate cancer, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Subsequent clinical development may include addition of arenaviral therapeutics expressing a third antigen, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA).

27



Direct evidence for the ability to induce a therapeutically relevant immune response to one of these antigens, PAP, comes from PROVENGE. To create PROVENGE, a personalized treatment, clinicians remove dendritic cells from the body, load them with PAP and then reintroduce them to the patient. The use of PROVENGE has been shown to increase survival in patients with metastatic, hormone resistant prostate cancer and led to its approval in 2010. Other companies are developing dendritic cell therapies similar to PROVENGE by using other tumor antigens. These dendritic cell therapies generally require complex, patient-specific therapeutic manufacturing processes involving isolating cells from patients, loading them ex vivo with tumor antigens and then readministering the cells to patients.
Since HB-300 is a replicating-based product candidate, we can deliver it by simple infusion whereby it targets APCs, such as dendritic cells, in the body, without the need for cellular isolation or ex vivo processing. We have shown in preclinical experiments and in the HB-200 clinical program that replicating vectors can lead to robust CD8+ T cell responses to the encoded antigens.

​
In April 2022, we presented preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting (abstract #3298 and abstract #4198) that showed antitumor activity with a single administration of replicating arenaviral immunotherapy targeting tumor self-antigens. Specifically, the arenaviral immunotherapy was able to overcome immune tolerance, induce potent T cell responses against two different tumor self-antigens and reduce tumor growth in these cancers. Notably, targeting tumor self-antigens can be a challenge because the immune system does not recognize these molecules as foreign. These preclinical data provided further support for the clinical evaluation of our HB-300 candidate for treatment of prostate cancer. The AACR data demonstrated the ability of our arenaviral immunotherapeutic technology to induce potent T cell responses against tissue-specific self-antigens, which is the same type of tumor self-antigens targeted by HB-300.
In July 2022, we announced that the FDA accepted our IND for HB-300 for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A Drug Master File was also accepted, which we believe will facilitate reduced cycle time between completion of preclinical studies and clinical entry of our pipeline projects.
In February 2023, we opened a first-in-human Phase 1/2, multinational, multicenter, open-label study of HB-302/HB-301 alternating dual-vector therapy in participants with mCRPC. This study (NCT05553639) has 2 phases: a Phase 1 Dose Escalation with an RP2D confirmation and a Phase 2 dose expansion. The Phase 1 dose escalation will 

28



evaluate HB-302/HB-301 alternating dual-vector therapy for safety and tolerability, preliminary efficacy and immunogenicity, and determination of a RP2D. The Phase 2 dose expansion will assess HB-302/HB-301 alternating dual-vector therapy at the RP2D defined in the Phase 1 portion of the study. Based on lessons learned from the HB-200 program, HB-302/HB-301 Alternating dual-vector therapy will be administered intravenously every three weeks (Q3W) for the first five doses and every 6 weeks (Q6W) from the fifth dose and onward. HB-302 is to be administered first followed three or six weeks later by HB-301.
In the future, we intend to develop further product candidates against other self-antigens with the aim of eventually establishing a franchise of dendritic cell-targeting agents that take advantage of the ability of arenaviruses to stimulate CD8+ T cell responses.
HB-700 for Targeting Mutated KRAS in Pancreatic, Colorectal and Lung Cancers
Targeting Shared Neoantigens
KRAS is a gene that acts as an on/off switch for cell growth as it is a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. When there is a mutation, or error, in the gene, cells can grow out of control. KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated proto-oncogenes with respective mutations found in approximately 30% of all human cancers. KRAS mutations are most frequently found in pancreatic cancer (85% to 90%), colorectal cancer (approximately 40%) and lung cancer (approximately 32%). However, the spectrum of mutations mainly target amino acid position 12 (G12D, G12V, G12R, and G12C) and position 13 (G13D), rendering these mutations an attractive target for immunotherapy. We plan to develop our KRAS targeted therapy for patients suffering from pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), colorectal cancer (CRC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and carrying one or more of the five most prevalent G12D, G12V, G12R, and G12C and position 13 G13D mutations. By integrating all 5 mutations into one single-vector, our product will potentially be a single therapeutic targeting multiple large cancer indications.
An early proof of concept for targeting KRAS mutations via CD8+ T cells was reported by Tran et al in 2016. Tran targeted a KRAS mutation on position 12 (G12D) in a patient with metastatic CRC by tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs); Tran demonstrated objective regression of all seven lung metastatic lesions from underlying CRC after the infusion of KRAS G12D-directed tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. More recently, small molecule inhibitors targeting mutated KRAS were developed and have showed promising results in clinical trials. However, those targeted therapies are limited to a single, specific KRAS mutation (KRAS G12C), which is frequently found in LUAD (approximately 50% of the late-stage cancers). However, KRAS G12C is underrepresented in PAAD and CRC when compared to other KRAS mutations such as G12D, G12V, G12R and G13D, which are much more frequently found (greater than 60% and greater than 90% in advanced CRC or PAAD, respectively). Hence, we believe that there is an urgent medical need to develop effective therapies for those patients.
Pancreatic cancer is considered one of the most lethal malignancies. Overall, approximately 500,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer per year are recorded globally. Incidence, prevalence and mortality for pancreatic cancer has increased by more than 50% during the last 25 years. Pancreatic cancer accounts for 1.8% of all cancers but causes 4.6% of all cancer deaths and pancreatic cancer deaths are expected to double by the year 2060. The high mortality rate can be explained in part as pancreatic cancer typically remains silent, not causing signs or symptoms for a long time. When patients become symptomatic, the cancer has usually reached an advanced and incurable stage. According to the American Cancer Society, the overall 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is approximately 9%. 97% of patients with metastatic cancer (i.e., stage IV) are expected to die within 5 years after diagnosis. Additional effective therapies are therefore urgently needed.
Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed malignancy worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death. The incidence of colorectal cancer was estimated at 1.9 million cases in 2020, causing 0.9 million deaths worldwide. The incidence is higher in highly developed countries and it is increasing in middle- and low-income countries due to westernization. The death rate from colorectal cancer in 2018 was approximately 55%. The 5-year survival rate of patients with localized stage colorectal cancer is 90%. About 38% of patients are diagnosed at this early stage. If the cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or organs and/or the regional lymph nodes, the 5-year survival rate is 72%. If the cancer has metastasized to distant parts of the body, the 5-year survival rate is less than 15%. The 

29



advancements made in understanding colorectal cancer pathophysiology have led to increased treatment options, including endoscopic and surgical excision, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, palliative chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and extensive surgery and local ablative therapies for metastases. These treatments have prolonged overall survival and screening through endoscopy also greatly enhanced the early detection, leading to good prospects of a cure. Although the prospect for colorectal cancer therapy is generally good, the increasing number of cases and rising incidence among younger generations still poses a heavy financial burden and a public health challenge. 
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with an estimated 1.6 million deaths annually. Approximately 85% of lung cancer patients suffer from a subgroup called non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), of which LUAD and lung squamous cell carcinoma are the most common subtypes. LUAD represents approximately 40% of NSCLC and is the most common primary lung cancer diagnosed in the United States. Despite new treatments, the 5-year survival rate is only 12% to 15%.
Our Solution: HB-700 for KRAS Mutated Cancers
HB-700 is based on our replicating arenavirus platform and was designed for treatment of cancers encoding mutated KRAS, especially KRAS-mutated lung, colorectal, pancreatic cancers. HB-700 is a replicating dual-vector therapy that has been engineered to encode fragments encoding multiple KRAS mutations found in these three cancers, specifically KRAS mutations G12D, G12V, G12R, G12C and G13D. By simultaneously targeting these five most common mutations, we believe HB-700 has the potential to benefit more patients than single mutation inhibitors. Potential coverage of KRAS mutations of important cancer indications by our product candidate HB-700 is illustrated in the following graph:
​
Similar to our other immuno-oncology candidate therapies, we can deliver HB-700 by simple infusion; HB-700 is designed to target APCs, such as dendritic cells, in the body, without the need for cellular isolation or ex vivo processing. Since induction of KRAS mutation-specific CD8+ T cells is the mode of action of this investigational therapy, and administration of alternating LCMV (HB-201)- and PICV (HB-202)-based vectors have been shown to induce unprecedented tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cell levels in the context of our HB-200 program, we also intend to maximize HB-700-induced CD8+ T cell responses of by using replicating vectors based on both LCMV and PICV in a sequential dosing regimen.
In October 2022, we announced a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Roche to develop HB-700 for KRAS-mutated cancers. Through the collaboration, we will conduct research and early clinical development through Phase 1b for HB-700. Upon the completion of the Phase 1b trial, Roche has the exclusive right to assume development responsibility and to commercialize licensed products across multiple indications upon approval. Under the terms of the agreement, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million. We are eligible for research, development and commercialization milestone-based payments for HB-700 and for an additional oncology candidate totaling up to approximately $930 million.

In February 2023, we achieved a $10.0 million milestone payment under our HB-700 collaboration agreement with Roche. The success-based milestone payment reflected the start of the HB-700 manufacturing process to support a Phase 1 clinical trial. We plan to submit an IND for HB-700 to the FDA in the first half of 2024.
Next Generation Product Candidates
A critical advantage of our technology is that it is designed to deliver full length proteins directly to APCs, such as dendritic cells, for endogenous expression and direct presentation to CD8+ T cells. Having APCs, such as dendritic cells, express full-length proteins and present all fragments (epitopes) overcomes the major difficulty of attempting to predict which part of the protein, or epitope, will be presented by the patient’s individual major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles. This presentation is important in immunotherapy because T cells will only recognize and respond to the antigen when it is bound to the individual’s MHC class I molecules, of which several hundred different versions exist in the population. While this approach overcomes the major issue faced by neoepitope-based personalized antigen approaches, it also has limitations in that the repertoire of known tumor-associated proteins that could be used for targets is limited. The best example of full-length proteins that are, to a degree, cancer-specific and immunogenic include the cancer testis antigens, examples of which include NYESO1, MAGE and CAGE. These cancer testis antigens have been known for decades, and many of them are currently being pursued by other companies. For many tumor types the cancer testis type of antigens remains unknown. Furthermore, most of the known tumor associated antigens are not commonly expressed or are not sufficiently specific to tumor tissue, making them suboptimal targets for clinical development.
In November 2018, we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with DarwinHealth, a New York City based bioinformatics company pioneering novel bioinformatic approaches, with the intent to identify the next generation of cancer testis antigens. Our goal is to find novel immunogenic full-length transcripts that are specific for, and highly represented in specific tumor types, allowing for an “off the shelf” approach for many cancer types. During the initial collaboration period, we intend to develop and validate the bioinformatics approach and resulting proprietary algorithms. We will start out by identifying “off-the-shelf” next generation cancer testis type antigens in mouse tumors and will assess the antitumor efficacy of our technology when targeting these same antigens in tumor-bearing animals. Mice will thereby serve as a testing ground to validate and optimize our new proprietary bioinformatics algorithms. In parallel we will apply the same validated algorithms to human samples and will prepare the next generation of cancer testis antigens.
HB-101, a Prophylactic Vaccine for Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Summary
The HB-101 program was our first clinical program and allowed us to establish proof of concept for our non-replicating technology, validating several important advantages of our arenaviral therapies. However, based on the limited data available from our three-dose schedule from our Phase 2 study and the strength of the data emerging from our immune-oncology programs, we have decided not to move forward with further development of the current HB-101 product formulation. 
Project Details 
HB-101 is a prophylactic vaccine designed to prevent transmission and clinical sequelae from cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV is a virus that is commonly transmitted in childhood and early adulthood. Infections result in lifelong latent persistence of the virus with few symptoms, if any. However, CMV infections present a serious risk for patients with suppressed immune systems, such as solid organ and stem cell transplant recipients. HB-101 is designed with our non-replicating technology that delivers two clinically validated antigens: pp65, to induce CMV-specific CD8+ T cells, and gB, to elicit CMV-neutralizing antibodies. 
As announced in November 2021, based on the strength of our HB-200 data in HPV16+ cancers, we have prioritized our oncology portfolio over infectious disease programs. We plan to continue developing infectious disease therapies only in partnership with other companies and decided to not further invest into the HB-101 program. 

31



In preclinical studies, we have observed that HB-101 has the ability to improve the survival rates in animal models in a statistically significant manner. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, HB-101 was well tolerated and elicited strong and durable CMV-specific immune responses in all 42 volunteers in the treatment arm. Importantly, we observed robust CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses as well as CMV-neutralizing antibody responses. As anticipated, the LCMV vector did not elicit clinically meaningful vector-neutralizing antibodies, as only one volunteer developed a transient neutralizing antibody response against the vector after three administrations. Furthermore, upon repeat administration, the pp65 CD8+ T cell levels achieved by the non-replicating vector increased in a statistically significant manner. The Phase 1 clinical findings were published in the April 2020 issue of The Journal of Infectious Diseases. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blinded Phase 2 clinical trial for HB-101 in CMV-negative patients awaiting kidney transplantation from living CMV-positive donors. Based on HB-101’s tolerability profile observed in the target patient population, and to gain further insights to inform a Phase 3 trial design, we added a new cohort of CMV-positive recipients awaiting kidney transplantation from CMV-positive or CMV-negative donors to the trial in early 2020 and amended the IND accordingly in January 2020. The goal of our Phase 2 trial was to assess safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of HB-101 in individuals receiving a kidney transplant from live donors to measure the decrease of post-transplant viremia. 
In November 2020, we reported initial positive interim safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data in which we observed a pre-transplant three-dose vaccination schedule was able to reduce incidence of CMV viremia, reduce antiviral use and prevent CMV disease. 
The Phase 2 HB-101 clinical trial concluded recruitment in June 2021 with 80 patients dosed. Given the challenges of enrollment of voluntary, live donor kidney transplantation during the COVID pandemic, the total number of patients enrolled in the trial was smaller than the originally planned 150 patients. Of the 80 patients dosed, 66 were CMV-negative and 14 were CMV-positive. Patients were followed up through a period of 12 months after transplantation. 
In March 2023, we reported final data from our Phase 2 trial. Safety of the vaccine was assessed for 80 patients who received at least 1 dose of HB-101 or placebo. The most commonly reported localized adverse event was tenderness post injection. Fatigue, headache and generalized myalgia were the most commonly reported adverse events associated with reactogenicity. None of these events were severe or life-threatening. No systemic adverse events associated with systemic reactogenicity were reported in the placebo group. HLA sensitization was reported for five patients (6.3%) receiving HB-101 and none of the patients who received placebo. A higher incidence of post-transplant kidney biopsy was observed in patients receiving HB-101 as compared to placebo. A total of 16 patients (24.6%) out of 65 who received kidney transplantation required post-transplant kidney biopsy. Of these 16 patients, 14 (31.8%) received HB-101 and two (9.5%) received placebo. There were five cases of biopsy-confirmed rejection, four in the HB-101 group and one in the placebo group. None of the cases of biopsy-confirmed rejection were considered by the investigator to be related to HB-101 and none of these participants lost their graft. 
Of the 66 CMV-negative patients who were enrolled in the trial, 52 received at least two doses of HB-101 or placebo prior to transplantation (n=34 HB-101, n=18 placebo). 17 patients received three doses prior to kidney transplantation (n=9 HB-101, n=8 placebo). The incidence of CMV infection, CMV syndrome or CMV disease, or need for antiviral treatment post-transplant was not reduced in CMV-negative participants who received only two doses of HB-101 as compared to placebo. Among the CMV-negative patients who received three doses of HB-101 prior to transplantation, a lower incidence of CMV viremia and use of antivirals post-transplant was observed. Two of nine patients (22.2%) who received HB-101 developed CMV viremia and required post-transplant antivirals as compared to three of eight patients (37.5%) who received three doses of placebo. No CMV disease was reported in the group of patients receiving three doses of HB-101 or placebo. Of the 14 CMV-positive patients enrolled in the trial, nine patients received at least two doses of HB-101 prior to transplantation and three patients received three doses. The CMV-positive arm of the trial did not include a placebo group. From the nine CMV-positive patients who received at least two doses of HB-101, four patients (44.4%) developed CMV viremia, including one patient (11.1%) who required anti-viral treatment. None of the CMV-positive patients reported CMV disease. These data are comparable to previously reported rates of CMV viremia in CMV-positive transplant recipients. 

32



CMV neutralizing antibodies were observed in CMV-negative and in CMV-positive patients after at least two doses of HB-101. Six of seven patients (85.7%) who received three doses of HB-101 and six of twenty patients (30.0%) who received two doses of HB-101 showed CMV neutralizing antibody responses. The magnitude of response observed was similar after two or three doses of HB-101 and comparable to that observed in Phase 1 with healthy subjects. Technically valid results from assays on CMV-specific T cell immune responses on the day of transplantation were available for only seven patients (as a consequence of sample logistics and assay performance). Two of the seven participants had received placebo and five had received HB-101. All three patients (100%) who had received three doses of HB-101 and one of the two patients (50%) who had received two doses of HB-101 showed CMV-specific T cell immune responses. The two patients with valid assays in the placebo group did not show a CMV-specific T cell immune response. 
As mentioned earlier, based on the limited data available from our three-dose schedule from our Phase 2 study and the strength of the data emerging from our immune-oncology programs, we have decided not to move forward with further development of the current HB-101 product formulation.

Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents, or what the scope of the claims in any future issued patents may be. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, narrowed, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing identical or substantially similar products or could reduce the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. With respect to patents and patent applications licensed to us, our licensors may have the right to terminate our licenses if we fail to comply with our obligations under the applicable license agreement. In addition, the claims granted in any of our issued patents may not provide us with advantages against competitors with similar products or technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or identical to technology developed by us but that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, by the time that any of our product candidates or those developed by our collaborators can be commercialized, our key patent may have expired or may only continue to remain in force for a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the usefulness of the patent.
We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

Gilead Collaboration Agreement and Stock Purchase Agreement
Overview
On June 4, 2018, we entered into the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, with Gilead to collaborate on preclinical research programs to evaluate potential vaccine products using or incorporating our replicating and non-replicating technology platforms for the treatment, cure, diagnosis, or prevention of HBV or HIV, which we refer to, collectively, as the Field.
Pursuant to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we granted Gilead an exclusive (even as to us and our affiliates), worldwide, royalty bearing license to our knowhow and our owned and in-licensed patent rights (including those patent rights in-licensed from the University of Geneva, the University of Basel, and the University of Zurich) that are necessary or reasonably useful for researching, developing, manufacturing or commercializing products that contain a vaccine that uses our replicating or non-replicating technology platforms for expressing one or more HIV or HBV antigens, which foregoing knowhow and patent rights we refer to as the Licensed Technology (and each such product a Licensed Product), for the purpose of researching, developing, manufacturing and commercializing Licensed Products for uses in the Field.
Pursuant to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we will own all new intellectual property conceived or created out of the activities conducted under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement that specifically relate to the replicating and non-replicating technology platforms. Gilead will own all other intellectual property rights conceived or created out of the activities conducted under the Gilead Collaboration Agreement.
On February 15, 2022, we entered into the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, which altered key aspects of the collaboration pertaining to the HIV therapeutic. Specifically, we assumed responsibility for advancing the HIV program through to the end of a Phase 1b clinical program, and Gilead retains an exclusive right, the Option, for further development thereafter. Pursuant to the Option, Gilead has the exclusive right to take back the development rights for such HIV program candidates and to further research, develop, and commercialize such candidates in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement. Gilead may exercise the Option at any time, but no later than 60 days after the receipt of a data package containing pre-clinical, clinical, chemistry and manufacturing control, regulatory and other data specified by the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement in return for an option exercise fee of $10.0 million. 
If the Option is not exercised by Gilead during the term of the Option, or if Gilead provides written notice to us of its intention to not exercise the Option, then the terms of the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement will be deemed terminated with respect to the HIV Development Plan and HIV Licensed Products (each as defined in the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement), and the Field and rights granted under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement will be limited to the HBV indication. Furthermore, if the Option expires or is terminated, the non-competition and right of first negotiations terms contained in the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement and summarized below will not be applicable to the development for HIV indications. In the event the Option is not exercised, we and Gilead will work in good faith to enter into a license agreement pursuant to which Gilead will grant us a milestone and/or royalty-bearing license under certain Gilead owned intellectual property necessary or reasonably useful to allow us to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize HIV product candidates as of the date on which the Option is declined.
Financial support from Gilead to us includes a $15.0 million non-refundable initiation fee and $35.0 million equity commitment pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement.
Governance
The development of the programs governed by the Gilead Collaboration Agreement is overseen by a six member joint steering committee (JSC), comprised of three representatives from each of us and Gilead. The JSC will oversee the activities carried out pursuant to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, including settling disputes arising under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, and approving a Licensed Product as being ready for development. 

37



Similarly, the Gilead Collaboration Agreement establishes a four member joint development committee (JDC) to oversee HIV development activities.
Research on HBV and HIV products
Under the original Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we are responsible for manufacturing and supplying to Gilead Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus and Pichinde Virus based vectors expressing one or more HBV antigens to the extent necessary for both us and Gilead to carry out our respective research activities under the research plans. These research plans are largely completed and both programs have advanced to development stage.
​
Development and Commercialization of products
Pursuant to the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, Gilead is solely responsible for conducting the development activities, including all regulatory filings, at its expense for any product arising from the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement designated for development by Gilead and approved by the JSC with respect to the HBV product candidates and we are responsible for conducting development activities for the HIV product candidates through the end of a Phase 1b study. If Gilead exercises the Option for the HIV product candidates, Gilead will be solely responsible for further (post Phase 1b) development activities of the HIV product candidates. Gilead is also solely responsible, at its expense, for the manufacture and commercialization of any HBV Licensed Product developed and commercialized under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, and if the Option is exercised, it will responsible, at its expense, for the manufacture and commercialization of any HIV Licensed Product.
Non-Compete
We may not, directly or indirectly, conduct, participate in or fund any research, development, manufacture, or commercialization of, or with respect to products utilizing arenavirus based vectors for the treatment, cure, diagnosis, or prevention of HBV or HIV, except for the activities we are expressly permitted to perform under the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement. If the Option expires or is terminated, the non-competition terms contained in the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement shall not be applicable to the development for HIV indications.
Right of First Negotiation
Pursuant to the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, in the event we offer a license or other rights to the Licensed Technology to a third party to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize a Licensed Product outside of the Field before June 4, 2028, we are required to offer Gilead a right of first negotiation for the same rights to the Licensed Technology in such field offered to the third party. If the Option expires or is terminated, the right of first negotiations terms contained in the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement will not be applicable to the development for HIV indications.
Financial Terms
Upon execution of the Gilead Collaboration Agreement, Gilead paid us a one-time upfront fee of $10.0 million and through to December 31, 2022, we received $16.2 million in milestone payments for the achievement of pre-clinical research milestones. 
Upon execution of the Restated Gilead Collaboration Agreement, we became entitled to a program initiation fee of $15.0 million. In addition, we are eligible for up to $140.0 million in developmental milestone payments for the HBV program and $50.0 million in commercialization milestone payments for the HBV program. If Gilead exercises the Option, we are eligible for up to a further $167.5 million in developmental milestone payments for the HIV program, inclusive of the $10.0 million program completion fee payable upon Option exercise, and $65.0 million in commercialization milestone payments for the HIV program. Upon the commercialization of a Licensed Product, if ever, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties of a high single-digit to mid-teens percentage on the worldwide net sales of each HBV Licensed Product, and royalties of a mid-single-digit to 10% of worldwide net sales of each HIV Licensed Product, if the Option is exercised.

We may terminate the Minnesota Agreement for convenience upon prior notice. The University of Minnesota may terminate the Minnesota Agreement if we cease operations, become insolvent, enter into any bankruptcy, receivership, or similar proceeding, or attempt to use the Minnesota Licensed Patent Rights as collateral for any debt.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have made substantial investments in recent years into the rapid development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of a range of pathologies, including infectious diseases and cancers, making this a highly competitive market.
We face substantial competition from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Our competitors compete with us on the level of the technologies employed to target various therapeutic areas, such as adoptive cell therapies and active immunization technologies, or on the level of development of product candidates. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to (i) obtain support for their research, development and commercialization of products or (ii) combine several treatment approaches to develop longer lasting or more efficacious treatments that may potentially directly compete with our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new therapies and combinations thereof, technologies, and data emerge within the field of immunotherapy and, furthermore, within the treatment of infectious diseases and cancers.

45



In addition to the current standard of care treatments for patients with infectious diseases or cancers, numerous commercial and academic preclinical studies and clinical trials are being undertaken by a large number of parties to assess novel technologies and product candidates in the field of immunotherapy. Results from these studies and trials have fueled increasing levels of interest in the field of immunotherapy.
Companies that compete with us directly on the level of the development of product candidates in our therapeutic areas include, among others:

● | In CMV management, companies such as Helocyte, Inc., VBI Vaccines Inc., Moderna, Inc., Biotest, Allovir, Merck & Co, and GSK plc.;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In immunooncology for HPV+ cancers, companies such as ISA Pharmaceuticals B.V., Transgene, Nyode, PDS Biotech, Cue Biopharma, Ultimovacs, and TCR Cure; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In metastatic Hormone Resistant Prostate Cancer, companies such as BRL Medicine, Inc, Regeneron, AvenCell, BioNTech, Ultimovacs and Madison Vaccines are investigating an immuno-oncology approach.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the technology level, direct competitor is Abalos GmbH, developing mammarenavirus vectors for cancer. Indirect technology competitors with relevance in cancer and infectious diseases include oncolytic viruses, bispecific antibodies, engineered cell therapies, tumor specific antigens, and other active immunization technologies. Specific indirect technology competitor companies include, among others, Gritstone Bio, Inc., Replimune Group, Inc., Merck & Co., BioNTech, Moderna, Turnstone Biologics Inc., Adaptimmune PLC, CureVac AG, Roche, and Novartis.
Many of our competitors, either alone or in combination with their respective strategic partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, the regulatory approval process, and marketing than we do. Mergers and acquisition activity in the pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sector is likely to result in greater resource concentration among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through sizeable collaborative arrangements with established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if one or more of our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, better tolerated, or of greater convenience or economic benefit than our proposed product offering. Our competitors also may be in a position to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly, resulting in a stronger or dominant market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be product safety, efficacy, convenience and treatment cost.
Manufacturing
We have been establishing robust manufacturing processes, reliable assays and strong supply agreements for all of the components used in our product candidates to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. These include the components for our non-replicating based and replicating based product candidates. For GMP production and testing we rely on qualified CMOs to produce and test our clinical material. Currently we do not own or operate manufacturing facilities beyond laboratory scale non-GMP production. We require that our CMOs produce bulk drug substances and finished drug products in accordance with cGMP, and all other applicable laws and regulations. Although we plan to establish our own manufacturing facility, we may continue to rely on CMOs for parts of the process, like filling and labelling of our products for commercial sale, to reduce supply risks and cost of goods sold. We continue to build and maintain agreements with manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to our product candidates.

46



We plan to ultimately establish our own manufacturing facility. By complementing CMO capacity with our own manufacturing facility, we aim to balance supply risks, reduce supply cycle time and optimize costs. We believe that having control over the whole manufacturing process will allow us to further increase the robustness and consistency of the process. We expect that control over our own manufacturing facility will also help to shorten overall timelines for new product candidates in our development pipeline, as well as help us develop drug formulations or presentations to simplify distribution as well as administration of future immuno-therapeutics. We also believe that having a dedicated manufacturing facility will allow us to optimize commercial scale processes and to develop a suitable workforce capable of supporting market launch.
Government Regulation
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biological products, such as those developed from our non-replicating and replicating technologies and any other product candidates we develop. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Biological Product Development
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Our product candidates and any future biological product candidates we develop must be approved by the FDA through a biologics license application (BLA) process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The BLA is a request for approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety, purity and potency. The FDA review and approval process generally involves the following:

1. | Completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP requirements;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
Preclinical Studies and IND
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well designed and well conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.

48



Clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.

● | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA. Failure to exhibit due diligence with regard to conducting required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators fifteen days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must also notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Products must meet applicable child resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.

49



FDA Review Process
Following completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. The BLA may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2023, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, is $3,242,026. The sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to an annual prescription drug program fee, which for fiscal year 2023 is $393,933. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the BLA for filing. The FDA decides whether to accept a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has ten months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) as well as other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in 

50



the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
Orphan drug designation for a biologic must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union (EU) has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
Expedited Development and Review Programs
FDA provides programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new products that are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are referred to as fast-track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval. These designations are not mutually exclusive, and a product candidate may qualify for one or more of these programs.
The fast-track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast-track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast-track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biologic can request the FDA to designate the product for fast-track status any time before receiving BLA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-BLA meeting.
A product that receives fast-track program designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review.
A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Sponsors are also required to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including 

51



progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. Under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a drug or indication approved under accelerated approval if, for example, the sponsor fails to conduct such studies in a timely manner and send the necessary updates to the FDA, or if a confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product. In addition, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
Additionally, a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast-track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program.
Fast-track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP) within 60 days of an end of Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials as well as other clinical development programs.
Post-Marketing Requirements
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as “off-label use”) and limitations on industry sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product 

52



approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws, including applicable product tracking and tracing requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violations, including failure to conform to cGMP regulations, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of post-approval problems with a product may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including recall.
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufactures to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act (FCA) which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In addition, transparency laws and patient privacy regulations by federal and state governments and by governments in foreign jurisdictions can apply to the manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities of pharmaceutical manufactures. These laws include:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchase, lease, order, arrangement, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA or federal civil monetary penalties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, such as the FCA, which impose criminal and civil penalties and authorize civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement of record material to a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

53



they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;

• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that perform services for them that involve the creation, maintenance, receipt, use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the U.S. federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed health care practitioners and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal price reporting laws, which require manufacturers to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs, where such reported prices may be used in the calculation of reimbursement and/or discounts on approved products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and FCA, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other 

54



marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations with respect to certain laws. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect our business in an adverse way. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business.
Ensuring our business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time and resource consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements may subject companies to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause a pharmaceutical company to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly and time consuming, and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs and imprisonment. If any of the above occur, our ability to operate our business and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in 2010, the ACA was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower cost biosimilars, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition to coverage under Medicare Part D for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. 

55



Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction which remains in effect through 2031. Due to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, estimated budget deficit increases resulting from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and subsequent legislation, Medicare payments to providers will be further reduced starting in 2025 absent further legislation. The U.S. American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Further, on May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.
Moreover, payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in reduced demand for certain pharmaceutical products or additional pricing pressures.
Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. President Biden has issued multiple executive orders that have sought to reduce prescription drug costs. Although a number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, and the Biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures, both the Biden administration and Congress have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket spending cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries from $7,050 to $2,000 starting in 2025, thereby effectively eliminating the coverage gap; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition; require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation; and delay until January 1, 2032 the implementation of the HHS rebate rule that would have limited the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
In the United States, there has also been a lot of legislative activity at the state level with respect to privacy regulation. For example, in California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which amendments went into effect on January 1, 2023, broadly defines personal information and creates individual privacy rights and protections for California consumers (as defined in the law), places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information. While there is an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, the CCPA may impact our 

56



business activities if we become a "Business" regulated by the scope of the CCPA. Additionally, as of January 1, 2023, the effective date for the CPRA’s amendments to the CCPA, California has a new state agency that is vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA. In addition to the CCPA, new privacy and data security laws have been proposed in more than half of the states in the U.S. For example, on January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA) became effective. Further, many additional U.S. state privacy laws will go into effect throughout 2023: the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) (July 1, 2023); the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA) (July 1, 2023); and the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA) (December 31, 2023). The CDPA, CPA, CTDPA, and UCPA are substantially similar in scope and contain many of the same requirements and exceptions as the CCPA, including exemptions for clinical trial data and limited obligations for entities regulated by HIPAA, that differ to a certain extent between the various laws. In addition, Congress regularly contemplates passing comprehensive privacy legislation at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the U.S., which trend may accelerate in the future. The effects of the CCPA, and other similar state or federal laws, are potentially significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and potential liability in an effort to comply with such legislation. The existence of comprehensive privacy laws in different states in the country could make our compliance obligations more complex and costly and may increase the likelihood that we may be subject to enforcement actions or otherwise incur liability for noncompliance.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our product candidates and any future product candidates we develop, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 as part of the ACA. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in 

57



a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
European Union Drug Development
In the EU our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained.
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 (Regulation), which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC (Directive) on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation offer sponsors the possibility to choose between the requirements of the previous Directive and the new Regulation if the request for authorization of a clinical trial is submitted in the year after the new Regulation became applicable. If the sponsor chooses to submit under the previous Directive, the clinical trial continues to be governed by the Directive until three years after the new Regulation became applicable. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years after the Regulation became applicable, the new Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
The new Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS); a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Regulation.
European Union Drug Review and Approval
In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations.

● | The centralized MA is issued by the European Commission (EC) through the centralized procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as medicines produced by biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicines (i.e. gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue engineered medicines) and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EU, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

58




● | Under the centralized procedure, the CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product and for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing MA. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application (MAA) by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the EC, who makes the final decision to grant an MA, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such request, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days, excluding clock stops, but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EU, this national MA can be recognized in other Member States through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member state in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SmPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other member state, referred to as the Concerned Member States, for their approval. If the Concerned Member States raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the member states (i.e., in the RMS and the Concerned Member States).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EU make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
Now that the United Kingdom (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the European Union, Great Britain will no longer be covered by centralized MAs (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized MAs will continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with a current centralized MA were automatically converted to Great Britain MAs on January, 1, 2021. For a period of two years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) the UK medicines regulator, may rely on a decision taken by the EC on the approval of a new MA in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain MA. A separate application will, however, still be required. The MHRA also has the power to have regard to MAs approved in EU Member States through decentralized or mutual recognition procedures with a view to more quickly granting an MA in the United Kingdom or Great Britain.
European Union new Chemical Entity Exclusivity
In the EU, innovative medicinal products approved on the basis of a complete independent data package qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon an MA and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s preclinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar MA in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar MAA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be placed on the EU market until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of 

59



those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies. There is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EMA to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, however, another company could nevertheless also market another version of the product if such company obtained an MA based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, preclinical tests and clinical trials.
European Union Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
In the EU, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan designation to promote the development of products that: (1) are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions; (2) either (i) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) it is unlikely that the marketing of the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EU, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following grant of an MA. During this market exclusivity period, neither the EMA nor the EC nor any of the competent authorities in the EU Members States can accept an application or grant an MA for a “similar medicinal product approval.” A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Market exclusivity may also be revoked in very select cases, such as if (i) it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized product; (ii) the marketing authorization holder of the authorized orphan product consents to such revocation; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder of the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an application for MA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
Regulatory Requirements After a Marketing Authorization has been Obtained
If authorization for a medicinal product in the EU is obtained, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include:

● | Compliance with the EU’s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules must be ensured. These rules can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2003/94/EC, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the EC Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Much like the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is sometimes governed by the national anti-bribery laws of the EU Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

60




imprisonment. EU Directive 2001/83/EC, which is the EU Directive governing medicinal products for human use, further provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization as well as the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
European Data Collection
The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the GDPR. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for data controllers of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for “high risk” processing, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification and “privacy by design” requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, like the United States. 
In addition, further to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law, referred to as the UK GDPR. The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the United Kingdom’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the European Union’s data protection regime. Although the GDPR and the UK GDPR currently impose substantially similar obligations, it is possible that over time the UK GDPR could become less aligned with the GDPR. The UK government has announced plans to reform the data protection legal framework in the UK in its Data Reform Bill but those have been put on hold. This lack of clarity on future UK laws and regulations and their interaction with EU laws and regulations could add legal risk, uncertainty, complexity and cost to our handling of EU personal information and our privacy and data security compliance programs and could require us to implement different compliance measures for the UK and the EU. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the European Union’s GDPR, the EC has now issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the United Kingdom to countries not regarded by the United Kingdom as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the United Kingdom to the EEA remain free flowing. To enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the UK, adequate safeguards must be implemented in compliance with EU and UK data protection laws. On June 4, 2021, the EC issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EU/EEA (or otherwise subject to the GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EU/EEA (and not subject to the GDPR). The new standard contractual clauses replace the standard contractual clauses that were adopted previously under the EU Data Protection Directive. The UK is not subject to the EC’s new standard contractual clauses but has published the UK International Data Transfer Agreement and International Data Transfer 

61



Addendum to the new standard contractual clauses (IDTA), which enable transfers from the UK. For new transfers, the IDTA already needs to be in place, and must be in place for all existing transfers from the UK from March 21, 2024. Following a ruling from the Court of Justice of the EU, in Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems, Case C-311/18 (Schrems II), companies relying on standard contractual clauses to govern transfers of personal data to third countries (in particular the United States) will need to assess whether the data importer can ensure sufficient guarantees for safeguarding the personal data under GDPR. This assessment includes assessing whether third party vendors can also ensure these guarantees. The same assessment is required for transfers governed by the IDTA. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the GDPR and doing so will require significant effort and cost.
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR or UK GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA Member States may result in fines up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the GDPR and UK GDPR grant data subjects the right to claim material and non-material damages resulting from infringement of the GDPR or UK GDPR. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, maintaining compliance with the GDPR and UK GDPR, will require significant time, resources and expense, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. This may be onerous and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
On June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit), and the UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. There was a transition period during which EU pharmaceutical laws continued to apply to the UK, which expired on December 31, 2020. However, the EU and the UK have concluded a trade and cooperation agreement (TCA) which was provisionally applicable since January 1, 2021, and has been formally applicable since May 1, 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not foresee wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework will continue to apply in Northern Ireland). The regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU regulations, however it is possible that these regimes will diverge in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation.
Rest of the World Regulation
For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, many jurisdictions outside of Europe are also considering and/or enacting comprehensive data protection legislation. These laws impose stringent requirements applicable to our collection, use and processing of personal data including identifiable health information.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products, when and if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made 

62



by CMS, an agency within the HHS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug or biological products exists in the United States. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, coverage determination is often a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is:

● | a covered benefit under its health plan;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | safe, effective and medically necessary;
--+-----------------------------------------


● | appropriate for the specific patient;
--+--------------------------------------


● | cost-effective; and
--+--------------------


● | neither experimental nor investigational.
--+------------------------------------------

The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of biosimilars for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs.
The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.

For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. In addition, as 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase.
As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide coverage and reimbursement. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and biologics is a time consuming and costly process, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which a drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Assuming coverage is obtained for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require copayments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely to use products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of prescribed products.
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
Human Capital Resources

As of February 28, 2023, we had 156 full-time employees and 22 part-time employees. Of our 178 full and part-time employees, 43, or 24,2%, have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 139, or 78,1%, are engaged in research and development activities. Pursuant to Austrian law, all of our Austrian employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. To further drive attraction and retention of our high-quality, experienced, and diverse workforce, we invest in the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
Corporate History

Facilities
Our principal executive offices are located in New York, New York, pursuant to a lease that expires in February 2024. Our European research and preclinical development operations are located in Vienna, Austria, where we lease and occupy approximately 30,656 square feet of office and laboratory space. Our first facility is leased pursuant to two operating leases, comprised of (i) a lease of unlimited duration for approximately 15,198 square feet of office and laboratory space and (ii) a lease set to expire in September 2028 and with no option to extend for approximately 2,357 square feet of storage space. In 2019, we entered into a lease for a second facility located in Vienna, Austria that is set to expire in February 2029, where we occupy approximately 15,440 square feet of office and laboratory space. In May 2021 we signed an agreement to purchase a parcel of land in the north of Vienna and have received building permission to build a GMP manufacturing plant. We have completed the detailed engineering phase and will take a decision to kick off construction work if and when required by pipeline progress. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our ongoing needs, and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
Legal Proceedings
We are currently a party to a patent proceeding opposing European Patent No. 3218504, which was granted to the University of Geneva in July 2020 and is exclusively licensed to us. The patent is directed to our replicating arenavirus platform technology and is part of our strategy to protect current product candidates based on this platform technology, including our lead oncology product candidates HB-201 and HB-202. We filed our formal response to the opposition with the European Patent Office (EPO) on September 3, 2021, in which we requested that the opposition be rejected and the European Patent No. 3218504 be maintained as granted. With the communication of June 27, 2022, the EPO’s Opposition Division has summoned the parties to oral proceedings scheduled for May 9, 2023, and issued a preliminary opinion, in which it followed our arguments and preliminarily rejected most of the attacks raised by the opponent, including the attacks against the claims that we consider most relevant for the protection of our technology. While the outcome of the matters can still not be predicted with certainty, and some lawsuits, claims or proceedings may be disposed or decided unfavorably, we do not expect that the pending patent opposition, and any asserted or unasserted legal claims or proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on us. However, if, as a result of the current patent proceeding, we would lose all, or at least part, of the protection under the opposed patent, such loss could erode our competitive position and harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. Besides the European opposition proceeding, we are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in other litigation or legal proceedings relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business.
