Item 1. Business
Overview
AudioEye is an industry-leading digital accessibility platform delivering website accessibility compliance at all price points to businesses of all sizes. Our solutions advance accessibility with patented technology that reduces barriers, expands access for individuals with disabilities, and enhances the user experience for a broader audience. We believe that, when implemented, our solution offers businesses and organizations the opportunity to reach more customers, improve brand image, build additional brand loyalty, and, most importantly, provide an accessible and usable web experience to the expansive and ever-growing global population of individuals with disabilities.
AudioEye primarily generates revenue through the sale of subscriptions for our software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) accessibility solutions. Our solutions are backed by machine-learning/AI-driven technology that finds and fixes common accessibility errors. Our core and supplemental solutions are designed to help websites and applications achieve and sustain substantial conformance with AudioEye’s interpretation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (“WCAG”) which are web accessibility standards published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium, the main international standards organization for the internet. Our solutions help mitigate a customer’s risk of costly digital accessibility-related legal action. AudioEye customers may purchase solutions directly through the AudioEye Marketplace, through a platform partner or an agency, such as Duda, that integrates our solutions into their marketplace, through a vertical Content Management System (“CMS”) partner, through an authorized reseller, or by working directly with the AudioEye sales team.
AudioEye stands out among its competitors because it offers automated and manual remediations and continuous monitoring of accessibility issues without fundamental changes to the website architecture. We also recognize that automation alone cannot fix all accessibility issues, which is why we also offer certified accessibility experts, who can provide manual testing and remediations. Our solution is trusted by some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, including ADP, Tommy Hilfiger, A360 Media, Samsung, Landry’s, and others. Government agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission, use our software with their digital platforms. We also work with government agencies at the state and local level.
Industry Background
If not coded properly, a website or application may not offer full access to content or functionality for individuals with disabilities, including users of assistive technology (“AT”), such as a screen reader. As a result, those sites may exclude potential users and customers. As discussed in more detail below, these sites also may not comply with U.S. and foreign laws requiring accessibility and digital inclusion, such as Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act.
Traditional solutions addressing web accessibility may be costly and difficult to implement. Historically, the process for achieving compliance has been driven by costly consulting services and has not fully utilized emerging technologies to reduce the compliance cost burden or keep up with the fast pace of new content creation. At the same time, web accessibility efforts have generally focused on a limited number of disability use cases, leaving many users’ accessibility needs for digital inclusion unaddressed. Businesses may have been reluctant to invest further in web accessibility solutions due to a perceived lack of return on the significant investment required to design and implement a thorough and usable compliance solution.
Other solutions have been developed to help users access websites, but these often require the installation of a plug-in or software on the user’s computer. Similarly, some are tailored to either single or a limited number of use cases and lack a holistic approach for addressing compliance and accessibility.
AudioEye Solutions
At its core, AudioEye’s offering provides an always-on testing, remediation, and monitoring solution that continually improves conformance with WCAG. This in turn helps businesses and organizations comply with WCAG standards as well as applicable U.S. and foreign accessibility laws. Our technology is capable of immediately identifying and fixing most of the common accessibility errors and addresses a wide range of disabilities including dyslexia, color blindness, epilepsy and more. AudioEye also offers additional solutions to provide for enhanced compliance and accessibility, including periodic manual auditing, manual remediations and legal 




support services. Our solutions may be purchased through a subscription service on a month-to-month basis or with one or multi-year terms. We also offer PDF remediation services and Native Mobile App and Audit reports to help our customers with their digital accessibility needs.

AudioEye Channels / Go-to-market:
We manage customers through two primary channels, Enterprise and Partner and Marketplace. Enterprise channel consists of our larger customers and organizations, including those with non-platform custom websites, who generally engage directly with AudioEye sales personnel for custom pricing and solutions. This channel also includes federal, state, and local government agencies. The Partner and Marketplace channel consists of our CMS partners, platform & agency partners, authorized resellers and the Marketplace. This channel serves small and medium sized businesses that are on a partner or reseller’s web-hosting platform or that purchase an AudioEye solution from our Marketplace.
We had one major customer (including the customer’s affiliates reflecting multiple contracts and a partnership with the Company) which accounted for approximately 17% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2022.
Our typical market sectors include, but are not limited to:

● | Finance and banking institutions;

Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, issued patents and pending patent applications. We have a patent portfolio comprised of twenty-four (24) issued patents in the United States and three (3) pending US patent applications. The commercial value of these patents is unknown.




We plan to continue to invest in research and development and expand our portfolio of proprietary intellectual property.
Competition
Most of our competition falls within the following categories:

● | There are a small number of web accessibility audit and tracking platform providers that purport to analyze websites for accessibility concerns. While these providers may sometimes identify issues for remediation, they typically do not provide remediation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Currently, other technology providers attempt to apply compliance remediation strictly through automation technology and accessibility toolbars.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There are a substantial number of consulting service providers offering website and application accessibility. Each generally provides an analysis of the various compliance issues associated with its clients’ websites. They ultimately provide resources and assistance in applying fixes and changes at the source.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Strengths
Our management believes the following competitive strengths will enable our success in the accessibility marketplace:

● | Unique patented technology. AudioEye builds all its products with the primary goal of enhancing the user experience regardless of the end-user’s ability. AudioEye is a marketplace technology leader providing a comprehensive accessibility solution that addresses every aspect of accessibility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AudioEye’s software automatically removes digital access barriers every day and has over 400 accessibility test outcomes for real-world users as they navigate websites. AudioEye’s Issue Reporting dashboard allows non-technical users to easily understand accessibility issues on their websites and the impact these issues have on site visitor experiences.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Broad price points and offerings. With a free 14-day trial for our base offering, AudioEye allows website owners to test our solution before choosing their preferred option. Our offerings range from low-cost to standard plans, to our customized, enterprise-wide solutions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Unique combination of advanced technology and expert-driven services. Our management believes that AudioEye addresses the problem of web accessibility holistically and provides a combination of leading-edge technology and high-quality specialized expertise, both offered as subscription services. Our solutions are designed to provide our customers with reliable and sustainable website accessibility compliance solutions; which lead to cost-savings and reduced time-to-market. We believe that the AudioEye solution allows our customers to focus not only on achieving compliance, but also helping maintain compliance and building inclusive digital experiences for their users throughout the life of the subscription.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We offer greater transparency in marketing our offerings. We believe there is no fully automated solution on the market that can provide 100% compliance. Our offerings provide automated remediations and a transparent accessibility score with additional manually driven enhancements. We think that as the industry develops, opaque products with unsubstantiated claims will ultimately fail.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Highly experienced inventors, technologists, and product development team. Our team comprises experienced software and SaaS developers and technologists.

Legal and Regulatory Framework
Many courts and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) hold that Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), together with Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, require public and private websites and mobile applications to be accessible to people with disabilities. In particular, Title III of the ADA governs private businesses and prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of services, programs, and activities by public accommodations.




While the law governing website and mobile application accessibility is still developing, many courts have held that websites and mobile applications fall within Title III’s scope. Some courts hold that Title III applies to all customer-facing websites and mobile applications, while others apply a “nexus” approach, which requires websites and mobile applications to comply with Title III if the website or mobile application is heavily integrated with a physical location. The U.S. Supreme Court has yet to articulate a unified approach, so some degree of uncertainty remains. Similarly, the DOJ has not promulgated new regulations laying out compliance standards for websites and mobile applications. In the absence of clear guidance, courts generally measure accessibility using the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (“WCAG”), which are promulgated by the World Wide Web Consortium.
This growing focus on website and mobile application accessibility is also reflected by other federal and state laws. The California Unruh Civil Right Act also prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, and California Government code Section 11546.7 requires state agency directors to certify that their websites comply with the WCAG. In 2010, Congress enacted the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act in an effort to update telecommunications protections for people with disabilities. Furthermore, the Department of Transportation has issued rules interpreting and implementing the Air Carrier Access Act and setting forth website accessibility standards for air carriers. This focus on website accessibility is growing internationally as well, with over 100 countries having ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
Although the WCAG does not carry force of law, courts may order defendants to substantially comply with the WCAG as a remedy for accessibility violations. Settlements and consent decrees generally require the same. We therefore design our products and services to help customer websites and mobile applications achieve and sustain substantial conformance with our interpretation of the informative guidance supplied through the WCAG, and we continue to improve and update our products and services as new guidance emerges.
Lawsuits alleging website or mobile application accessibility claims typically follow a similar pattern. Both private commercial businesses and governmental agencies are regularly targeted for alleged violations. With an increasing amount of business taking place remotely, ensuring compliance with the relevant accessibility statutes is becoming increasingly important.
Employees
AudioEye is comprised of highly talented, empathic, and effective individuals working to make the web more accessible.
AudioEye has worked primarily in a remote environment since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. AudioEye provides employees with the technology and resources required to have a high-quality remote work experience while remaining connected to teams in other locations. We expect to continue a hybrid of virtual and in-person work in the future.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 120 full-time employees. We use a variety of methods for recruiting including in-house recruiting resources, employee referrals and third-party agencies, when required, and we believe our mission allows us to recruit and retain high-quality talent.
We utilize independent contractors to supplement our staff, as needed. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage and believes that its employee relations are positive.
