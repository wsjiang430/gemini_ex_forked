Overview‌
 We are an innovative clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a broad pipeline of novel immunotherapies by applying our proprietary technology to our TRACTr and TRACIr platforms to better treat patients suffering from cancer. Our initial focus is on developing a novel class of T cell engagers (TCEs), and our lead product candidates are designed to target clinically validated drug targets. While TCE therapeutics have displayed potent anti-tumor activity in hematological cancers, developing TCEs to treat solid tumors has faced challenges due to the limitations of prior TCE technologies, namely (i) overactivation of the immune system leading to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), (ii) on-target, healthy tissue toxicities and (iii) poor pharmacokinetics (PK) leading to short half-life. We use our TRACTr platform technology to engineer product candidates designed to overcome these limitations. We are developing a broad pipeline with lead programs targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2). In October 2022, the first patient was dosed with our PSMA-TRACTr (JANX007) in our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with prostate cancer and we anticipate providing an interim clinical update from the trial in the second half of 2023. For our EGFR-TRACTr (JANX008), we recently received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of an Investigational New Drug application (IND). For our TROP2-TRACTr we expect to select a development candidate in 2023. We are also applying our proprietary technology to develop a TRACIr costimulatory bispecific product candidate (JANX009) against programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Cluster of Differentiation 28 (CD28) designed to further enhance the anti-tumor activity of T cells, which we believe has the potential to be used as a single-agent or in combination with our current TRACTr pipeline and other modalities. We expect to submit an IND for this product candidate in 2023. Based on data we have generated in non-human primates (NHPs), we believe our TRACTr and TRACIr product candidates have the potential for (i) significantly reduced risk of toxic CRS responses, (ii) reduced risk of on-target, healthy tissue toxicities, and (iii) improved half-life with once-weekly dosing in humans.

The promise of TCE technologies and their current limitations

TCEs are an emerging class of immunotherapies that bridge a tumor cell and a T cell to activate and redirect T cells to attack and eliminate tumors. TCEs have demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity in early clinical trials and in multiple animal models that rivals that of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR T cell) therapies, with the distinct advantage that they are not cell therapies and have the potential to be offered as readily available, off-the-shelf therapies, which would avoid the lengthy, complicated, and expensive manufacturing process required for approved autologous CAR T cell therapies. One TCE, blinatumomab, marketed by Amgen as BLINCYTO, has been approved by the FDA and, like the FDA-approved CAR T cell therapies, has been limited to hematological malignancies.
 Three properties of existing TCEs have limited their potential to treat solid tumors:
 
•Cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS arises from the systemic activation of T cells and can result in life-threatening elevations in inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Severe and acute CRS leading to dose-limiting toxicities and deaths has been observed upon the dosing of TCEs developed using other platforms to treat cancer patients in prior clinical studies. This toxicity severely restricts the maximum blood levels of TCEs that can be safely dosed.
 •On-target, healthy tissue toxicity. On-target, healthy tissue toxicity, arising from expression of the tumor target in healthy tissue and scarcity of highly tumor-selective antigens, is another limitation hindering the development of TCEs to treat solid tumor cancers. TCEs developed using other platforms not designed for tumor-specific activation have resulted in clinical holds and dose-limiting toxicities resulting from target expression in healthy tissues.
 •Short half-lives. TCEs quickly reach sub-therapeutic levels after being administered as they are quickly eliminated from the body due to their short exposure half-lives. For this reason, TCEs such as blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) are typically administered by a low-dose, continuous infusion pump over a period of weeks to overcome the challenge of a short half-life and maintain therapeutic levels of the drug in the body. This continuous infusion dosing regimen represents a significant burden for patients.
 Our TRACTr and TRACIr platforms‌
 We believe our proprietary TRACTr and TRACIr platforms offer the potential to expand the breadth of patients that can be treated with TCEs and non-TCE based immunomodulators while reducing the risk of life-threatening toxicities. Each of our proprietary TRACTrs and TRACIrs are comprised of an antigen-binding domain, a T cell-binding domain, domain-optimized peptide masks, an albumin-binding domain, and cleavable peptide linkers. The mask is a peptide designed to bind to the tumor or T cell-binding domain. It inhibits the binding domain’s interaction with its target, thereby inhibiting the activation of T cells. The antigen and T cell-binding domains in our TRACTr and TRACIr product candidates may be covalently attached to peptide masks that block binding and activity until they are removed. We use proprietary peptide linker sequences composed of tumor protease recognition sites to attach these masks to the antigen-binding domains in a way designed to make the masks highly sensitive to removal by tumor proteases but highly stable in the absence of these proteases. In addition, we attach an albumin-binding domain to one mask, which is designed to extend the half-life of our TRACTr and TRACIr product candidates until they become activated inside a tumor.
 While our TRACTr and TRACIr platforms are novel and unproven and our product candidates remain in the early clinical, preclinical or discovery stage, our technology is designed to offer the following features for the discovery and development of novel therapies for the treatment of solid tumors:
 
•Potential to reduce CRS and on-target, healthy tissue toxicity risk. By engineering our TRACTrs and TRACIrs with novel peptide masks that are designed (i) to be selectively activated in the tumor microenvironment and (ii) for any activated TCEs or non-TCE based immunomodulators to be rapidly cleared from healthy tissue upon escaping from the tumor, our product candidates have the potential to overcome the toxicity challenges of TCEs, non-TCE based immunomodulators and systemic immunotherapies in general.
 •Potential for extended half-life of our TRACTrs and TRACIrs. We designed our TRACTrs and TRACIrs with an albumin-binding domain to be stable in the bloodstream and to have an extended serum half-life before activation. Our TRACTrs and TRACIrs have demonstrated long half-lives in NHPs, which we believe translates to the potential for once-weekly dosing in humans. This contrasts to 

first-generation TCEs and non-TCE based immunomodulators that are rapidly cleared and require high frequency or continuous dosing.
 •Potential for activity at low levels of target expression. Our TRACTrs and TRACIrs are designed to be active at low levels of tumor target expression where other treatment modalities lose efficacy. In preclinical studies, our TRACTrs and TRACIrs did not require high levels of tumor target expression to activate T cells to kill cancer cells.
 •Modularity. Our TRACTr and TRACIr platforms’ modular characteristics enable us to leverage the learnings from the development of our product candidates to progress the discovery process of new TRACTr and TRACIr candidates against a wide variety of targets.
 •Manufacturability. The development, manufacturing and control processes of our TRACTr and TRACIr molecules closely resemble those used for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the expectation for a relatively lower cost of goods.
 A schematic of our proprietary TRACTrs and TRACIrs in development and their modular components is depicted below.
 
Our lead programs
 Our lead TRACTr product candidates are designed to target PSMA, EGFR, and TROP2. Each of these tumor targets is clinically validated and implicated in solid tumors with high prevalence, including metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), colorectal cancer (CRC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), urothelial cancer (UC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We are also applying our proprietary technology to develop a TRACIr costimulatory bispecific product candidate against PD-L1 and CD28 designed to further enhance the anti-tumor activity of T cells,
which we believe has the potential to be used as a single-agent or in combination with our current TRACTr pipeline and other modalities. Our pipeline is summarized below:

In addition to our wholly-owned pipeline programs, we have a strategic research collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (Merck) to develop TRACTr product candidates directed against two cancer targets selected by Merck.‌
 
Our TRACTr Programs
 We are building a broad portfolio of TRACTr programs led by our PSMA, EGFR, and TROP2 targeted TRACTrs.
 
Our PSMA-TRACTr (JANX007)
 Our PSMA-TRACTr is designed to target PSMA, a protein expressed in prostate cancer tumors and the vasculature of other tumors. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, and will lead to over 34,000 estimated deaths in the United States in 2023. PSMA is highly expressed in prostate cancer which has led to the development of PSMA-targeted biologics, including TCEs. A third-party clinical trial with a continuously infused PSMA-TCE demonstrated clinical benefit, suggesting the potential of a PSMA-TCE approach. Given the challenges of continuous infusion, other companies are developing TCEs that enable once-weekly dosing. However, clinical trial results have shown dose-limiting CRS toxicities as single agents, highlighting the limitations of traditional TCEs. Efforts to mitigate CRS include combining TCEs with the immunosuppressive agent dexamethasone and/or lower sub-efficacious initial priming doses followed by efficacious doses. These strategies have the potential to either reduce the efficacy of the TCE or introduce other problems in patients who frequently have multiple pre-existing comorbidities. Our PSMA-TRACTr is designed to generate potent anti-tumor activity in mCRPC patients by enabling the delivery of higher concentrations of active drugs to tumors than traditional TCEs. We believe that our PSMA-TRACTr product candidate has the potential to deliver therapeutic benefits to patients while minimizing severe adverse events (SAEs), including the prevention of dose-limiting CRS. In October 2022, the first patient was dosed with JANX007 in our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with prostate cancer and we anticipate providing an interim clinical update from the trial in the second half of 2023.
 
Our EGFR-TRACTr (JANX008)
 Our EGFR-TRACTr is designed to target EGFR, a well-validated target that is overexpressed in many cancer types with multiple approved mAbs, including ERBITUX, marketed by Eli Lilly and Merck KGaA, for the treatment of CRC and SCCHN, and VECTIBIX, marketed by Amgen and Takeda, for the treatment of CRC. Beyond CRC and SCCHN, the below figure describes cancers where EGFR may be overexpressed and approved EGFR-directed therapeutics, illustrating the significant unmet medical need for the majority of these patient populations where there are no approved, EGFR-directed treatment options.


Figure 1. Common cancers where EGFR may be overexpressed and where EGFR-directed therapeutics, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and mAbs are already approved
 
CRC represents one tumor type for which EGFR is overexpressed. However, approximately 85 percent of patients do not respond to anti-EGFR mAbs, and of those that do, resistance often develops. SCCHN and NSCLC cancers also represent tumor types for which EGFR is frequently overexpressed, and anti-EGFR antibodies have received marketing approvals. Frequently genetic mutations in signaling pathways, such as KRAS mutants (45 percent in CRC, and 35 percent in NSCLC) can lead to de novo resistance to naked antibody therapy. Stronger tumoricidal activity is needed. We believe that EGFR-directed immunotherapies, including TCEs, have the potential to address this high unmet need. Our EGFR-TRACTr is designed to generate potent anti-tumor activity by enabling the delivery of higher concentrations of active drug to tumors than traditional TCEs. We believe that our EGFR-TRACTr product candidate has the potential to deliver therapeutic benefits to patients while minimizing SAEs, including the prevention of dose-limiting CRS. We recently received FDA clearance of an IND that we submitted for JANX008.

Our TROP2-TRACTr
 Our TROP2-TRACTr is designed to target TROP2, a clinically validated anti-tumor target for which there is a recently approved anti-TROP2 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), sacituzumab govitecan, marketed as TRODELVY by Gilead. TRODELVY has been approved to treat metastatic TNBC and UC. Early clinical proof-of-concept has also been demonstrated in NSCLC and several other solid tumor indications potentially targetable by TROP2, including hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2 breast cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, prostate cancer, and endometrial cancer. However, these ADCs are also associated with significant dose-limiting toxicities. Our TROP2-TRACTr is designed to generate potent anti-tumor activity, initially in TNBC patients, by enabling the delivery of higher concentrations of active drug to tumors than traditional TCEs. We believe that our TROP2-TRACTr has the potential to deliver therapeutic benefits to patients while minimizing SAEs, including the prevention of dose-limiting CRS. We believe that our TROP2-TRACTr has the potential to deliver the potent anti-tumor activity of a TCE to patients who have tumors that overexpress TROP2 while also providing increased safety and dosing convenience. We plan to select a TROP2-TRACTr development candidate in 2023.
Our TRACIr Program
 We are also applying our proprietary technology to our TRACIr platform, with our first program being a tumor-activated PD-L1xCD28 T cell costimulatory bispecific.
 
Our PD-L1xCD28 costimulatory bispecific (JANX009)
 Our PD-L1xCD28 costimulatory bispecific program is designed to amplify existing T cell anti-tumor responses and TRACTr activity through a dual mechanism of (i) blocking tumor-expressed immunosuppressive signaling and (ii) activating T cell costimulatory signaling. Our bispecific molecule is designed to bind to immunosuppressive PD-L1 on tumor cells and to the CD28 costimulatory receptor on T cells. We believe that our technology’s potential to convert the inhibitory checkpoint signal into an immune activation signal via costimulation could stimulate further anti-tumor activity. Like current checkpoint inhibitors, we believe our costimulatory program could be combined with a variety of classes of therapeutics, including chemotherapeutics as well as other immunotherapies. We have shown that the use of this bispecific led to potent T cell-directed tumor cell killing in cell assays in which a checkpoint inhibitor was ineffective. In addition, our costimulatory program enhanced the potency of tumor cell killing when combined with a TCE. We plan to submit an IND for our PD-L1xCD28-TRACIr in 2023.
Our Research Collaboration with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.
 In December 2020, we entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Merck to develop TRACTr product candidates distinct from those in our internally developed pipeline. Merck had the right to select up to two collaboration targets related to next-generation TCE immunotherapies for cancer treatment, both of which have been selected. Merck received an exclusive worldwide license for each selected target and intellectual property from the collaboration. In return, we are eligible to receive up to $500.5 million per target in upfront and milestone payments, plus royalties on sales of the products derived from the collaboration. Merck will provide research funding under the collaboration.
 We plan to selectively consider other strategic collaboration opportunities in the future.
 
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to unleash the potential of our TRACTr and TRACIr platforms technology to transform the lives of cancer patients. To achieve this goal, critical elements of our strategy include the following:
 •Advance our lead TRACTr programs through clinical development. In October 2022, the first patient was dosed with our PSMA-TRACTr in our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with prostate cancer and we anticipate providing an interim clinical update from the trial in the second half of 2023. For our EGFR-TRACTr, we recently received FDA clearance of an IND. For our TROP2-TRACTr we expect to select a development candidate in 2023. We believe that our programs have the potential to transform the treatment of metastatic diseases such as mCRPC, CRC, NSCLC, RCC, TNBC, UC, SCCHN, and a wide range of other tumor types that overexpress PSMA, EGFR or TROP2, which are clinically validated targets.
 •Broaden our portfolio of TRACTr product candidates. Our TRACTr platform technology’s modular characteristics enable us to leverage the learnings from the development of our product candidates to progress the discovery process of new TRACTr candidates against a wide variety of targets. For our first three programs, once an antibody was identified, we developed a masked tumor-binding domain in less than six months to begin evaluating TRACTr development candidates. We are actively pursuing the development of additional TRACTr programs against several other clinically validated targets.
 •Expand our internal pipeline into logical classes of therapeutics beyond TCEs. Our tumor-activated masking and bispecific molecule design enable more molecular phenotypes than classic CD3 targeted TCEs. For example, our proprietary technology allows the masking and tumor activation of different T cell therapy modalities, including costimulation via CD28 engagement of a PD-L1xCD28 bispecific molecule, our first TRACIr program. We believe this TRACIr program has the potential to be used as a single-agent or in combination with our current TRACTr pipeline and other modalities. We intend to submit an IND for our PD-L1xCD28 TRACIr in 2023. We are also applying our proprietary technology 

to create molecules designed to attract, redirect, or mobilize different types of immune cells to tumor sites that exclude or lack resident immune cells.
 •Selectively evaluate opportunities to maximize the potential of our programs in partnership with leading biopharmaceutical companies. We plan to selectively evaluate potential opportunities on a program-by-program basis with biopharmaceutical companies whose research, development, and/or geographic capabilities complement our own with the goal to help mitigate clinical and commercial risk and/or maximize global commercial potential.
 
TCEs as novel therapeutics to overcome the limitations of current immunotherapies
 
Background
 Immunotherapy has ushered in a new era of cancer treatment with unprecedented responses in many tumor types. Unleashing the power of the immune system on cancer cells has been one of the most promising new advancements in a field long dominated by suboptimal approaches such as chemotherapy. One class of immunotherapy, checkpoint inhibitors, has generated encouraging efficacy results and represents the standard of care (SOC) in selected tumor types. However, despite this clinical benefit for a subset of patients, it is estimated that less than 13 percent of all cancer patients in the United States respond to checkpoint inhibitors. Tumors have evolved to evade and dampen tumor immune surveillance. Consequently, new classes of immunotherapy designed to overcome the various immune-evasion mechanisms that tumors employ have emerged.
 TCEs are immunotherapies that bridge tumor-fighting T cells and tumors in a way that overcomes this challenge. TCEs are bivalent biologics; that is, they can bind to two different cell surface targets. By selecting one target on a tumor cell and another on a T cell, the TCE bridges these two cell types to trigger tumor cell killing by the T cell. TCEs can be mass-produced and made available as off-the-shelf therapies. Furthermore, TCEs, as biologics, have pharmacologic properties that allow control of the amount of active drug in the body at any one time. The doses that are delivered can be titrated, and the pharmacokinetics generally follow those of other biologics.
 Other approaches to immunotherapy, like cell therapies, such as CAR T cell therapy, are also emerging. We believe the unique characteristics of TCEs render them an attractive immunotherapy alternative to these approaches. While cell therapies have displayed efficacy in treating cancer, these treatments have also led to morbidity and mortality resulting from toxicity. Cell therapies also typically require complex and costly manufacturing strategies, making them unsuitable for several aggressive tumors and advanced disease patients. They are primarily confined to treatment for hematological malignancies, and CAR T cell therapies have not to date been successfully developed for any solid tumor.
 While we believe that TCEs hold promise in treating solid tumors, three properties of TCEs derived from other platforms have limited their potential:
 
•Cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS arises from the systemic activation of T cells and can result in life-threatening elevations in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Severe and acute CRS leading to dose-limiting toxicities and deaths has been observed upon the dosing of TCEs developed using other platforms to treat cancer patients in prior clinical studies. This toxicity severely restricts the maximum blood levels of TCEs that can be safely dosed.
 •On-target, healthy tissue toxicity. On-target, healthy tissue toxicity, arising from the expression of the tumor target in healthy tissue and scarcity of highly tumor-selective antigens, is another limitation hindering the development of TCEs to treat solid tumor cancers. TCEs developed using other platforms not designed for tumor-specific activation have resulted in clinical holds and dose-limiting toxicities resulting from target expression in healthy tissues.
 •Short half-lives. TCEs quickly reach sub-therapeutic levels after being administered as they are quickly eliminated from the body due to their short exposure half-lives. For this reason, TCEs such as blinatumomab (BLINCYTO) are typically administered by a low-dose, continuous infusion pump over a period of weeks to overcome the challenge of a short half-life and to maintain therapeutic levels of the drug in the body. This continuous infusion dosing regimen represents a significant burden for patients.
 
Next generation approaches to overcome the challenges of conventional TCEs

First-generation immuno-oncology drugs have an increased risk of systemic toxicity due to the active drug circulating throughout the body. Second generation immuno oncology drugs, such as protease-activated antibodies, have attempted to limit systemic toxicities by being administered in an inactive form and only activated upon exposure to tumor proteases within the tumor microenvironment. However, once these activated drugs leave the tumor, they circulate throughout the body and accumulate over time, leading to on-target, healthy tissue toxicity in‌ target-expressing tissues. Several product candidates have been developed that take advantage of tumor-associated proteases to activate potent drugs in tumors. These include prodrugs such as leucine-doxorubicin and masked antibodies such as Probodies developed by CytomX. In initial clinical trials, CytomX has demonstrated clinical benefit in patients and a mechanistic proof-of-concept for this masked antibody approach, with 83 percent of the patients having enough tumor protease activity to achieve clinically relevant levels of unmasked antibodies in the tumor. However, an unwanted consequence of CytomX’s approach is that the relatively long half-lives of its drugs in active form led to their accumulation in healthy tissue throughout treatment.
 We are developing our TRACTr and TRACIr platforms to address the limitations of previous generations of immuno-oncology drugs and to restrict activity to tumors. Our TRACTrs and TRACIrs are designed to be activated by tumor-specific proteases but, upon activation, be converted to a form that has a short half-life to eliminate them from the body rapidly should they re-enter the circulatory system. A representation of the pharmacokinetic design of first and second-generation TCEs and our TRACTrs / TRACIrs is shown in the figure below.
 
Figure 2. Our TRACTr and TRACIr platforms are designed to limit the activity of our therapies to tumor sites, reducing the risk of on-target, healthy tissue toxicity
 
Our TRACTr and TRACIr Platforms‌
 Our TRACTr and TRACIr platforms are designed to offer the following features for the discovery and development of novel therapies for the treatment of solid tumors:
 
•Potential to reduce CRS and on-target, healthy tissue toxicity risk. By engineering our TRACTrs and TRACIrs with novel peptide masks that are designed to be selectively activated in the tumor microenvironment and designed for any activated TCEs or non-TCE based immunomodulators to be rapidly cleared from healthy tissue upon escaping from the tumor, our product candidates have the potential to overcome the toxicity challenges of TCEs, non-TCE based immunomodulators and systemic immunotherapies in general.
 •Potential for the extended half-life of our TRACTrs and TRACIrs. We designed our TRACTrs and TRACIrs with an albumin-binding domain to be stable in the bloodstream and to have an extended serum half-life before activation. Our TRACTrs and TRACIrs have demonstrated long half-lives in NHPs, which we believe translates to the potential for once-weekly dosing in humans. This contrasts with first-generation TCEs or non-TCE based immunomodulators that are rapidly cleared and require high frequency or continuous dosing.

•Potential for activity at low levels of target expression. Our TRACTrs and TRACIrs are designed to be active at low levels of tumor target expression where other treatment modalities lose efficacy. In preclinical studies, our TRACTrs and TRACIrs did not require high levels of tumor target expression to activate T cells to kill cancer cells.

 •Manufacturability. The development, manufacturing and control processes of our TRACTr and TRACIr molecules closely resemble those used for monoclonal antibodies with the expectation for a relatively lower cost of goods.
 
TRACTr and TRACIr design and structure
 Our TRACTr and TRACIr product candidates are biologics comprised of multiple domains that have been designed to serve specific functions but engineered to function as a single unit. At their core, our TRACTr and TRACIr product candidates are TCEs and non-TCE based immunomodulators, respectively, that couple a tumor antigen binding domain to a T cell-specific antigen binding domain. Masks cover both binding sites and block activity while our TRACTr or TRACIr product candidate are in circulation and exposed to healthy tissues. We use proprietary peptide linker sequences composed of tumor protease recognition sites to attach these masks to the antigen-binding domains in a way that is designed to make the masks highly sensitive to release by tumor proteases. This release exposes both the tumor-binding domain and the T cell antigen binding domains to generate a fully activated TCE or non-TCE based immunomodulator. This is designed to enable our TRACTr or TRACIr product candidates to bridge the T cells and tumor cells into close proximity and to enable T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells.
 Our TRACTr and TRACIr product candidates also have a proprietary albumin-binding domain designed to increase their half-life in serum. This proprietary domain is designed to bind albumin and, by doing so, prevent the rapid degradation and elimination of TRACTr or TRACIr product candidates. In contrast, blinatumomab (BLINCYTO), a TCE that lacks an albumin-binding domain, has a very short half-life in serum and is administered through continuous infusion for 28 days per treatment cycle, with hospitalization recommended for up to the first nine days.
 Our TRACTrs and TRACIrs are designed to limit binding to their targets in healthy cells. When our TRACTr or TRACIr product candidates are in the non-activated state, they are designed not to activate T cells before reaching the tumor. Upon exposure to tumor proteases, the linkers are designed to be cleaved, and the masks and albumin-binding domains are designed to be released to generate a fully active TCE or non-TCE based immunomodulator. This is designed to enable tumor-specific T cell activation and tumor cell killing while priming the activated TCE or non-TCE based immunomodulator for rapid elimination should it leave the tumor and re-enter circulation. We believe that our technology’s design to restrict T cell activation specifically to tumor sites provides the opportunity to generate TCEs and non-TCE based immunomodulators with broader therapeutic windows. We summarize our
TRACTr and TRACIr structure, activation mechanism in tumor tissue, and rapid elimination from healthy tissue once activated below.
 


Our TRACTr and TRACIr development process
 We have developed robust processes to select specific sequences for each of these components in a TRACTr or TRACIr both for their individual properties and for their ability to contribute to the desired properties of our fully assembled product candidates.
 
•Antigen-binding domains. Our initial product candidates are based on antigen binding domains, which have been incorporated into other products associated with clinical activity. As we expand our pipeline, we are developing proprietary antigen binding domains against novel targets.
 •Geometry connecting the antigen binding domains. The orientation of a tumor-specific and a T cell-specific antigen binding domain is central to creating a TCE or non-TCE based immunomodulator with optimal T cell activation. We have found that the orientation between the two antigen-binding domains profoundly affected activity in preclinical studies. For example, we constructed two PSMA TCEs with similar binding domains but of different geometry, where their potency in T cell-directed, PSMA-specific tumor cell killing differed by over 900-fold, as shown in the figure below.
 
Figure 3. The orientation of the two antigen binding domains in a PSMA-TCE led to an over 900-fold difference in potency in preclinical studies (top), and the configurations of these two TCEs, VH and VL (bottom)
 


•Mask Discovery. Each mask sequence is designed to be optimized for a specific antigen-binding domain through an iterative process of phage display and quantitative binding assays designed to select for those masks that can prevent binding to the target antigen. We use a directed evolution-based process using proprietary phage libraries. We go through multiple cycles of selection and amplification of potential inhibitory peptides capable of blocking the antigen-binding domain from binding to its target to optimize masked TCE or non-TCE based immunomodulator stability in serum and limit cleavage to the tumor microenvironment thereby reducing toxicity. We depict our mask discovery process in the figure below.
 
Figure 4. Using directed evolution and phage display technology, we identify potential mask sequences that are designed to completely block antigen recognition by our antigen binding domains
 


•Single versus dual masks. Our technology allows us to develop product candidates with either one or both antigen-binding domains masked depending on the tumor target’s profile. For tumor targets with minimal healthy tissue expression or toxicity concerns, we develop single mask TRACTrs or TRACIrs designed to block the T cell-binding domain to prevent non-tumor-specific activation of T cells that contributes to CRS. For targets with high/broad healthy tissue expression or toxicity concerns, we develop dual mask TRACTrs or TRACIrs designed to mask both domains to minimize the risk of healthy tissue toxicity and CRS. We depict the single and dual mask TRACTr and TRACIr structures in the figure below.
 
Figure 5. We design both single and dual masked TRACTr and TRACIr product candidates based on the healthy tissue expression levels of the tumor-targeted antigen and the risk of healthy tissue toxicity
 


•Cleavage linker. We optimized the selection of cleavage linkers by a process involving identifying the predominant proteases in solid tumors and mining databases for potential substrates of these proteases. We then screened peptide sequences for their sensitivity to cleavage by these proteases. We specifically identified potential cleavage linker sequences that were rapidly cleaved by a tumor-specific protease to improve anti-tumor TRACTr or TRACIr activities potentially, yet remain stable in human, NHP, and mouse serum to limit non-tumor activation. We have identified several proprietary cleavable linkers that 

we utilize to optimize efficacy and stability in our TRACTrs and TRACIrs, as shown in the schematic below.
 


•Albumin-binding domain. We developed our proprietary albumin-binding domain derived from a llama antibody optimized for its ability to bind to albumin from both humans and NHPs, the primary preclinical species in which we conduct our in vivo experiments due to the similarity in target sequences and immune function with humans. As shown in Figure 6 below, our albumin-binding domain has a nearly identical binding affinity to albumin from these two species.
 
Figure 6. Our proprietary albumin-binding domain had potent binding to both NHP and human albumin
 


•Development viability. Once we have identified the critical components for any product candidate, we assemble them and modify the assembled construct using standard techniques to make it more human-like. We then assess its feasibility for development. We are primarily concerned with the following attributes of a potential product candidate:
 oManufacturability using standard mammalian cell expression systems;
 oDrug-like properties such as solubility, thermal stability, and stability in human serum; and
 oOptimal performance with efficient linker cleavage, mask removal, antigen-binding, albumin-binding, and functional activity.

Our extensive library of masks and linkers combined with our protein engineering expertise allows us to generate product candidates that meet the high standards that we have set for therapeutic candidates that we believe have the potential to have clinical activity across a broad spectrum of indications.
 
Initial proof of technology study
 To demonstrate proof of concept for TRACTrs, we tested a TRACTr and a first-generation TCE that targeted EGFR using identical antigen-binding domains. We assessed the risk of developing CRS by dosing both agents in non-human primates (NHPs), a species that was chosen because of the similarity in antigen binding affinities in these NHPs compared to humans, and demonstration that an EGFR bi-specific T cell engager (EGFR-BiTE, or EGFR-TCE) triggered significant CRS and healthy tissue toxicity up to and including death.
 Our EGFR-TRACTr included an albumin-binding domain intended to increase its half-life in serum to extend the interval between dosing while simultaneously utilizing the protease-mediated cleavage of the linker to remove the domain once our TRACTr was activated. In NHPs, our EGFR-TRACTr was found to have a half-life of over 100 hours compared to approximately one hour for the corresponding EGFR-TCE, as demonstrated below. We believe that this half-life is consistent with the potential for once-weekly dosing in humans. Furthermore, we believe the rapid elimination of the unmasked TCE minimizes the risk of TCE-induced CRS due to short circulation time in serum.
 
Figure 7. Our EGFR-TRACTr was shown to have an extended half-life in NHPs compared to a corresponding TCE while the unmasked form was rapidly eliminated
 


In this same study, a dose of 3µg/kg and 10µg/kg of the EGFR-TCE resulted in the release of high levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. In comparison, 600µg/kg of our EGFR-TRACTr reduced those levels to less than 500pg/ml, shown below, even though the plasma levels were substantially higher with the TRACTr than the TCE. Published studies have shown median IL-6 levels of 122pg/ml in patients with Grade 0-3 CRS and 8,300pg/ml in Grade 4-5 CRS patients. A similar reduction in the other inflammatory cytokines measured was observed with our TRACTr compared to the EGFR-TCE.
 
Figure 8. Our EGFR-TRACTr did not lead to CRS in NHPs even at high doses. Inflammatory cytokines evaluated in this study included IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), interferon gamma (IFNg), and interleukin-2 (IL-2). TNFa, IFNg, and IL-2 were all below the quantification limit (BQL)
 


The lack of induction of inflammatory cytokines in NHPs associated with CRS in humans is consistent with the potential for the peptide masks to prevent antigen binding and thereby T cell activation. In these studies, the EGFR-TRACTr maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was higher than 600µg/kg due to a lack of CRS, lack of safety observations, and lack of healthy tissue toxicity. In contrast, a published study using a constant infusion of an EGFR-TCE observed an MTD of 30pM plasma levels and 300pM lethal dose plasma levels, where significant liver and kidney toxicities were reported. In similar models, our TRACTr dosed at 600µg/kg had no signs of toxicity and a Cmax of 360nM, further suggesting the potential for improvement in safety via masking.
 In a separate study in a mouse model of human CRC using human HCT116 tumor cells and human immune cells, our EGFR-TRACTr displayed potent anti-tumor activity. As shown in the figure below, our EGFR-TRACTr dosed for 10 days at 1.5mg/kg led to significant tumor shrinkage, which was roughly equivalent to that observed with 0.5mg/kg of the EGFR-TCE.
 With the observation of reduced CRS risk for our EGFR-TRACTr relative to the EGFR-TCE (at a substantially lower dose than the TRACTr) in our NHP study, and the observation of comparable anti-tumor activity of our EGFR-TRACTr and the EGFR-TCE (at one third of the dose of the our TRACTr) in our mouse model of human CRC, we believe our EGFR-TRACTr may offer reduced CRS risk relative to the EGFR-TCE when dosed at levels expected to result in anti-tumor activity in humans.

Our Lead Programs
 Our lead TRACTr product candidates are designed to target PSMA, EGFR, and TROP2. These tumor targets are clinically validated and implicated in solid tumors with high prevalence, including mCRPC, CRC, RCC, TNBC, SCCHN, UC, and NSCLC. We are also applying our proprietary technology to develop a TRACIr costimulatory bispecific product candidate designed to further enhance the anti-tumor activity of T cells, which we believe has the potential to be used as a single-agent or in combination with our current TRACTr pipeline and other modalities. We anticipate submitting an IND for this product candidate in 2023. Our pipeline is summarized below:
 

Our PSMA-TRACTr (JANX007) for the treatment of mCRPC
 We are developing our PSMA-TRACTr product candidate for the treatment of mCRPC. In a preclinical study, PSMA-TRACTr showed a 500-fold reduced ability to induce T cell-mediated killing of prostate cancer cells when masked compared to when unmasked. In addition, we found that our PSMA-TRACTr was well-tolerated in NHPs, substantially reduced cytokine release relative to the unmasked TCE, and had a prolonged half-life. In October 2022,
the first patient was dosed with our PSMA-TRACTr (JANX007) in our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with prostate cancer and we anticipate providing an interim clinical update from the trial in the second half of 2023.

Prostate cancer overview
 Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. Over 3 million men live with prostate cancer in the United States alone. Approximately 12 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point during their lifetime. In 2023, there will be an estimated 288,300 new prostate cancer diagnoses in the United States, representing over ten percent of all new cancer diagnoses. An estimated six percent of prostate cancer patients develop metastatic disease, which is associated with a five-year survival rate of approximately 30 percent. There will be an estimated 34,700 deaths in the United States due to prostate cancer in 2023.
 
Treatment options for prostate cancer
 Patients diagnosed with the localized, low-risk disease may be followed by active surveillance or treated with definitive therapy by prostatectomy or radiation therapy. Patients with recurrent disease are typically treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and if high risk, ADT combined with chemotherapy or addition of novel hormonal therapy. Androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, activate androgen receptor-dependent gene transcription, which drives the growth of prostate cancer cells. ADT blocks testicular production of testosterone, otherwise known as a chemical castration, and is administered for those patients who present initially with regional or advanced disease at diagnosis or develop advanced disease at recurrence. Most ADT-treated patients develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and progress.‌
 
Treatment options for mCRPC
 Standard therapies for these patients include novel hormonal agents, which either further suppress androgen synthesis (abiraterone), or efficiently block Androgen receptor signaling (Enzalutamide). Further treatment options range from cytotoxic chemotherapy (taxanes), Radium-223, or immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T), and an autologous activated antigen presenting cell therapy. PARP inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors are also approved, but for only small subsets of patients. The median overall survival (mOS) of patients with mCRPC in multiple Phase 3 trials is approximately 12-18 months and has been augmented by only 2-5 months by the best agents, highlighting the need for more effective therapies in mCRPC.
 
PSMA is a validated prostate cancer antigen
 PSMA is a prostate-specific transmembrane protein expressed at a 100-fold to a 1,000-fold higher level in prostate adenocarcinoma than in the benign prostate. Of importance, PSMA expression is (i) increased when patients are on ADT and (ii) highest in high-grade and mCRPC. Over half of prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy with high levels of PSMA are likely to have recurrent disease, at a rate that is twice that of patients observed with low levels of PSMA. PSMA is the target of FDA-approved imaging agent, ProstaScint, TCEs, radioisotopes, and ADCs in development.
 Clinical results published in the journal Immunotherapy in 2020 from a Phase 1 trial of pasotuxizumab, a PSMA-targeted TCE, highlight the potential of targeting mCRPC with a PSMA-targeted TCE and the limitations of current approaches. Patients in this trial were initially treated with daily subcutaneous injections, but anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) developed in all treated patients, likely due to the high doses administered. These high doses of the drug, which have a short half-life, were required to achieve sufficient drug exposure to the tumor. The trial was then amended so that clinicians could dose patients using continuous intravenous infusion. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are a validated measure of disease severity in prostate cancer patients. A dose-dependent reduction in serum PSA levels was observed in the intravenous group, achieving a median best PSA change from baseline of approximately 55 percent in the high dose group. The percentage of patients with PSA reduction of greater than 50 percent in the top three groups was 33 percent. Two patients had long-term PSA responses. One patient had long-term stable disease with 337 days to tumor progression. One patient had near-complete regression of lymph node lesions and bone metastases, with 500 days to disease progression. One of the patients who had initially presented with extensive metastatic disease had a reduction in PSA of greater than 96 percent. Within 43 days of treatment, the extent of the PSMA-expressing tumor was significantly reduced. By day 85, there was little evidence of tumor remaining. While no on-target healthy tissue toxicity was reported, treatment-emergent increases in alanine‌ aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase did occur, and over half of patients in this trial developed Grade 3
or Grade 4 drug-related SAEs. Three patients dosed with continuous infusion developed CRS; two were Grade 2 and one was Grade 3.
 We believe that our TRACTr platform technology can be used to create a PSMA-TCE with the potential to build upon the preliminary signs of anti-tumor activity observed with pasotuxizumab through improved pharmacokinetics and reduced risk of CRS toxicity.
 
Our solution: JANX007
 We designed JANX007 as a single-masked TRACTr in which the PSMA-binding domain is unmasked. The T cell-specific binding domain (CD3e) is masked to prevent CRS. We illustrate the JANX007 structure in the figure below.
 


We found that our PSMA-TRACTr product candidate exhibited a 500-fold shift in activating T cell killing of PSMA expressing tumor cells in an in vitro assay when it was masked than when the mask was removed, as shown in the figure below. We believe this difference in activity has the potential to greatly reduce toxicities caused by PSMA expression outside of tumors.
 
Figure 11. Our masked PSMA-TRACTr was 500-fold less potent in activating T cell killing of PSMA expressing tumors than when the mask was removed in an in vitro assay
 

In NHPs, our PSMA-TRACTr demonstrated a half-life of approximately 119 hours, which we believe translates to once-weekly dosing in humans. In comparison, pasotuxizumab was reported to have a half-life of one to three hours in humans and required continuous intravenous infusion for 5 weeks to maintain sufficient drug exposure, representing a significant burden for patients. The figure below illustrates our PSMA-TRACTr and the PSMA-TCE half-lives in NHPs. For comparison, the projected human efficacious dose (pHED) of 100pM for pasotuxizumab based on the clinical trial protocol for its Phase 1 study is also shown.
 
Figure 12. Our PSMA-TRACTr had a half-life of 119 hours in NHPs, which we believe is in line with the potential for once-weekly dosing in humans
 


In this same study, dosing our PSMA-TRACTr at 87µg/kg resulted in minimal levels of inflammatory cytokine production relative to an unmasked PSMA-TCE at 10µg/kg, which led to a greater than 130-fold expression of IL-6 as shown in the figure below. We believe these data suggest our PSMA-TRACTr will have the potential to reduce CRS risk relative to an unmasked PSMA-TCE. Furthermore, in a separate study of our PSMA-TRACTr dosed at 1,000µg/kg once-weekly for three weeks in NHPs, no dose-limiting toxicities were identified.

Figure 13. Dosing of our PSMA-TRACTr in NHPs had minimal effects on inflammatory cytokine levels, several of which were below the limit of quantification (LOQ). In contrast, dosing of a PSMA-TCE led to substantial levels of IL-6 as well as elevation of other inflammatory cytokines commonly observed in CRS.
 


Clinical development
 In October 2022, the first patient was dosed with our PSMA-TRACTr (JANX007) in our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with prostate cancer and we anticipate providing an interim clinical update from the trial in the second half of 2023. This study is our first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and the preliminary efficacy of JANX007 administered as a single agent in adult subjects with mCRPC (NCT05519449).
 
Our EGFR-TRACTr (JANX008) for the treatment of colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer and non-small cell lung cancer
 We are developing our EGFR-TRACTr product candidate for the treatment of metastatic CRC, RCC, SCCHN and NSCLC. We have shown in preclinical studies that our EGFR-TRACTr had an 8,500-fold reduced ability to activate T cells when it is masked compared to when it is unmasked. In addition, we demonstrated that our EGFR-TRACTr was well-tolerated in NHPs, substantially reduced cytokine release relative to the unmasked TCE, and had a prolonged half-life.

Colorectal cancer overview
 Most colorectal cancers are a type of tumor called adenocarcinoma, cancer of the cells that line the inside tissue of the colon and rectum. However, other less frequently arising colorectal tumors include a neuroendocrine tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, small cell carcinoma, and lymphoma.‌
 Excluding skin cancers, colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the United States. It is estimated that there will be approximately 107,000 new cases of colon cancer and 46,000 new cases of rectal cancer in the United States in 2023 and approximately 52,600 deaths. Approximately 25 percent of patients have metastatic
disease at diagnosis, meaning the disease has spread to other organs, and about 50 percent of patients with CRC will eventually develop metastases. Approximately 35 percent of the patients with a new diagnosis of CRC, and approximately 85 percent of patients with a new metastatic CRC diagnosis, will die within five years. Furthermore, the cumulative recurrence rate of CRC at four years is 100 percent.
 
EGFR is a validated colorectal cancer target
 EGFR is the most commonly overexpressed membrane protein in cancer. In CRC, up to approximately 80 percent of patients overexpress EGFR, and higher expression levels have been linked to more aggressive metastatic disease, which is associated with poor prognosis, including decreased disease-free survival and overall survival (OS). However, EGFR‌ expression is not limited to tumors and is widely expressed throughout the body, resulting in systemic toxicities with EGFR-directed therapies.
 
Treatment options for mCRC
 Treatment of CRC typically involves cytotoxic chemotherapy in a regimen containing folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan, called FOLFIRI, and radiation. Anti-EGFR mAbs such as cetuximab (ERBITUX, marketed by Eli Lilly) and panitumumab (VECTIBIX, marketed by Amgen and Takeda) can be added to standard therapy. However, only a relatively small percentage of patients respond to mAb therapies, and of those that do, resistance often develops. Of the CRC patients that are resistant to EGFR mAb treatment, 35 percent to 45 percent are resistant due to KRAS mutations. Treatment with EGFR mAbs is not recommended for patients with KRAS mutations. Treatment with EGFR mAbs is not recommended for patients with KRAS mutations. This suggests that if an anti-EGFR therapeutic that could treat all EGFR overexpressing patients harboring KRAS mutations was developed, the potential treatable population could be significantly expanded.‌
 A combination of nivolumab (OPDIVO) and ipilimumab (YERVOY), which are both marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb, as well as pembrolizumab monotherapy (KEYTRUDA, marketed by Merck & Co.), have been approved for the treatment of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) CRC. This is a subset of four to five percent of CRC patients with mutations that lead to high genetic instability. These results suggest that EGFR-directed immunotherapies have the potential to treat CRC and that, at least in some patients, there are sufficient T cells to mount an effective immune response.
 
Head and neck cancer overview
 Cancers known collectively as head and neck cancers usually begin in the squamous cells that line the moist, mucosal surfaces inside the head and neck, otherwise known as squamous cell carcinomas. Cancers of the head and neck are further categorized by the area of the head or neck in which they begin: oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity and salivary glands. Head and neck cancers account for approximately four percent of all cancers in the United States and are more than twice as common among men as they are among women. Researchers estimate that approximately 67,000 men and women in the United States will be diagnosed with head and neck cancers in 2023. Additionally, there will be an estimated 15,400 deaths from head and neck cancer in 2023. EGFR is overexpressed in approximately 90 percent of head and neck cancers.
 
Treatment options for SCCHN
 Locoregional SCCHN is treated with curative intent but at the cost of functional impairment and locoregional recurrence or metastatic disease. Standard first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic (R/M) disease that is not amenable to local therapy was for more than a decade, cetuximab, an EGFR antibody, plus chemotherapy with platinum and 5-fluorouracil (the EXTREME regimen), which provides a mOS of about 10 months and is associated with substantial adverse events.
 A significant number of cancer patients fail to respond to immunomodulatory agents regardless of PD-L1 expression, presumably because of tumor resistance mechanisms against immune attacks. The two-year OS in first-line R/M SCCHN ranged from 38 percent to 27 percent, pending the combined positive score. Consequently, there is a significant unmet need for improved therapies.
 
Non-small cell lung cancer overview

It is estimated that there will be approximately 238,000 new lung cancer cases and 127,000 lung cancer deaths in the United States in 2023. NSCLC accounts for approximately 80 to 85 percent of lung cancer cases. The overall five-year survival for all patients diagnosed with NSCLC is approximately 25 percent.
 
Treatment options for NSCLC
 Targeted therapies have been developed for NSCLC patients with tumors containing alterations in EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK); however, less than thirty percent of patients are eligible for these therapies. Patients ineligible or resistant to these therapies can be treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This treatment regimen significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) and OS compared to standard chemotherapy. However, despite the availability of these therapies, very few patients are cured of their disease, and the prognosis in NSCLC remains poor.‌
 
Renal cell carcinoma overview
 Renal cell carcinoma, or kidney cancer, is a disease in which malignant cells are found in the lining of tubules in the kidney. RCC is the deadliest urological neoplasm and late-stage disease has a five-year survival rate of approximately 15%. The American Cancer Society’s estimates for kidney cancer in the United States for 2023 are approximately 82,000 new cases of kidney cancer will be diagnosed and approximately 15,000 people will die from this disease.
 
Treatment options for RCC
 In RCC, greater than 90 percent of patients express EGFR. Treatment of 1L mRCC typically involves the combination of a PD1 or PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, avelumab) with an anti-VEGFR TKI such as axitinib, cabozantinib or lenvatinib. Alternatively, nivolumab may be combined with the CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab. The use of single agent anti-VEGF TKI’s such as sunitinib is declining due to data from the checkpoint combinations, however usage still remains as an option in the more favorable risk patients. In the 1L setting with checkpoint inhibitor combinations, the objective response rates range from approximately 30-70% with median PFS (mPFS) from 12-24 months and mOS typically being greater than 40 months.
Almost all 1L patients become resistant to standard therapy with less than 50% being eligible to receive 2L therapy. The majority of 2L patients typically receive an anti-VEGR agent such as cabozantinib. Limited data exists for anti-VEGF therapy outcomes in checkpoint refractory patients. The most widely used 2L treatment option is cabozantinib, which has reported objective response rates of only 17%, with mPFS of 7.4 months and mOS of only 21 months. Over 80% of patients receive little to no benefit of SOC 2L treatment options.
 
Our solution: JANX008
 We designed JANX008 as a dual-masked TRACTr in which both the EGFR and T cell-binding domains are designed to be masked. We illustrate the JANX008 structure below.
 
Figure 14. Structure of JANX008
 

We found that our EGFR-TRACTr product candidate exhibited an 8,500-fold shift in activating T cell killing of EGFR expressing HCT116 tumor cells in an in vitro assay when it was masked than when the mask was removed, as shown below. We believe this differential in activity can significantly reduce healthy tissue toxicities caused by EGFR expression outside of tumors.
 Since these cells harbor KRAS mutations and are resistant to anti-EGFR antibodies, the observed EGFR-TCE activity suggests that EGFR inhibitor-resistant (including KRAS mutants sensitive to our EGFR-TRACTr) CRC will be sensitive to our EGFR-TRACTr. Our observation is consistent with published studies demonstrating EGFR-TCE activity in cell lines resistant to EGFR mAbs and harbored KRAS mutations. The results of our study are depicted in the figure below.
 
Figure 15. Our masked EGFR-TRACTr was over 8,500-fold less potent at T cell-mediated killing of EGFR-expressing tumor cells than an equivalent unmasked TCE in an in vitro assay
 

In NHPs, our EGFR-TRACTr demonstrated a half-life of approximately 94 hours, which we believe translates to the potential for once-weekly dosing in humans. This compares to the half-life of the unmasked EGFR-TCE of approximately one hour. In figure 16, we illustrate our EGFR-TRACTr and the EGFR-TCE half-lives in a study in NHPs.
 
Figure 16. Our EGFR-TRACTr had a half-life of approximately 94 hours in NHPs, which we believe is in line with once-weekly dosing in humans
 


In this same study, dosing our EGFR-TRACTr at 100µg/kg resulted in minimal levels of inflammatory cytokine release, relative to an unmasked EGFR-TCE at 10µg/kg, which led to a greater than 20-fold expression of IL-6. We believe these data suggest that our EGFR-TRACTr has the potential to reduce CRS risk relative to an
unmasked EGFR-TCE. Furthermore, in a separate, study of our EGFR-TRACTr dosed at 600µg/kg once-weekly for three weeks in NHPs, no dose-limiting toxicities were identified.
 
Figure 17. Dosing of our EGFR-TRACTr in NHPs had minimal effects on inflammatory cytokine levels. In contrast, dosing of an EGFR-TCE led to substantial levels of IL-6 as well as elevation of other inflammatory cytokines commonly observed in CRS
 


Clinical development plans
 
 We recently received FDA clearance of an IND to conduct a Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors that overexpress EGFR, including CRC, RCC, SCCHN and NSCLC, to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. In addition, we plan to evaluate additional opportunities where EGFR is overexpressed.

Our TROP2-TRACTr for the treatment of TROP2 overexpressing solid tumors
 We are developing our TROP2-TRACTr program to treat TROP2 overexpressing solid tumors, including TNBC, UC, and NSCLC. TROP2 is a cell surface glycoprotein overexpressed by many human carcinomas. In preclinical studies, we showed that our TROP2-TRACTr had an over 6,500-fold reduced ability to activate T cells when it was masked compared to unmasked. In addition, we demonstrated that our TROP2-TRACTr was well-tolerated in NHPs, substantially reduced cytokine release relative to the unmasked TCE, and had a prolonged half-life. We expect to select a development candidate in 2023 for our TROP2-TRACTr.
 
Triple-negative breast cancer overview
 Although some forms of breast cancer are less aggressive and have displayed improving survival rates, there are still highly aggressive forms of disease that represent a significant unmet need. For example, TNBC tends to present later than other types of breast cancer and grows, spreads, and recurs faster than most other types. Women with triple-negative breast cancer are also more likely to develop metastases. They typically have a poorer prognosis than other types of breast cancer due to the lack of targeted therapies available for treatment. TNBC is referred to as “triple-negative” because it is estrogen receptor-negative (ER-), progesterone receptor-negative (PR-), and HER2-, and is unlikely to respond to hormonal or HER2-targeted therapies. TNBC accounts for approximately 15 percent of all breast cancers and is more aggressive and more likely to recur compared to receptor-positive breast cancers. The five-year survival rate for TNBC is approximately 77 percent compared to approximately 90 percent for other types of breast cancers.
 
Urothelial cancer overview

Cancer that begins in cells that line the urethra, bladder, ureters, renal pelvis, and some other organs is referred to as urothelial carcinoma. UC is the most common type of bladder cancer, and bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men in the United States. UC accounts for 90 percent of all bladder cancers, and can also arise in‌ the renal pelvis and ureters. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be approximately 83,000 new cases and 17,000 deaths caused by bladder cancer in the United States in 2023. Despite the approval of checkpoint inhibitors in recent years, the treatment of patients with advanced UC in the second-line setting remains a significant unmet need. The relative five-year survival rate for patients with metastatic UC is about six percent.‌
 
TROP2 is a validated cancer target
 TROP2 is a transmembrane protein involved in calcium signal transduction. The observed TROP2 level is low in normal tissues, and TROP2 is overexpressed in various cancer types, such as breast, lung, urothelial, endometrial, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, gastric, colon, head and neck, and glioma. Furthermore, TROP2 functions as an oncogene capable of driving tumorigenesis and metastasis in epithelial cancers such as colorectal cancer. TROP2 expression in cancer cells has long been correlated with drug resistance, and high levels of TROP2 expression have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in various cancer types. A meta-analysis, including data from approximately 2,500 patients, increased TROP2 expression was associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival outcomes across several solid tumors.
 The increased expression of TROP2 in tumors has made it both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for cancer. Sacituzumab govitecan, marketed as Trodelvy by Gilead, is an anti-TROP2 ADC that received accelerated approval by the FDA in April 2020 as a treatment for metastatic TNBC, UC in April 2021 and HR+/HER2-BC in February 2023. In metastatic TNBC, this ADC had a 33 percent overall response rate, providing clinical validation of TROP2 as a target. However, sacituzumab govitecan was also associated with significant toxicities: 21 percent of patients reported Grade 3 or Grade 4 serious gastrointestinal events, and 43 percent reported Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia. Beyond TNBC, a published report from the 2019 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium indicated an objective response with sacituzumab govitecan in approximately 30 percent of highly pretreated urothelial cancer patients.‌‌
 Furthermore, in a Phase 1 trial of datopotamab deruxtecan (DS-1062), an anti-TROP2 ADC in clinical development by AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, objective responses were obtained by 21 percent to 25 percent of NSCLC patients treated. Promising third-party clinical data in multiple metastatic cancer indications have been reported, including HR+/HER2- breast and urothelial cancers. As a therapeutic target, TROP2’s independence from other therapeutic approaches (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors) lends combination therapy with TROP2 targeted therapies a potentially promising approach.
 
Our solution: our TROP2-TRACTr program
 We designed our TROP2-TRACTr program as a dual-masked TRACTr in which both the TROP2 and the CD3e antigen binding domains are masked in order to minimize the risk of on-target, healthy tissue toxicity. We illustrate our dual masked TROP2-TRACTr structure in the figure below.
 
Figure 18. Structure of our dual masked TROP2-TRACTr
 
In preclinical in vitro studies, our unmasked TROP2-TCE led to T cell-mediated cell killing of several tumor cell lines with potencies that generally correlated with the level of TROP2 expression. The TROP2-TCE was active against both high TROP2-expressing cell lines, such as BxPC3 and NCI-N87, which were sensitized to killing by
concentrations of TROP2-TCE of less than 1 pM and the low TROP2-expressing cell line, HCT116 at 10 pM, as shown in the figure below.
 
Figure 19. Our TROP2-TCE led to potent T cell-mediated cell killing across a range of tumor types that express TROP2 in preclinical studies
 


We found that our TROP2-TRACTr exhibited a 12,500-fold shift in activating T cell killing of TROP2 expressing tumor cells in an in vitro assay when it was masked than when the mask was removed. We believe this differential in activity has the potential to greatly reduce toxicities caused by TROP2 expression outside of tumors.
 
Figure 20. Our masked TROP2-TRACTr was greater than 12,500-fold less potent at activating T cell mediated killing of TROP2-expressing tumor cells than unmasked TROP2-TCE in an in vitro assay
 


In NHPs, our TROP2-TRACTr demonstrated a half-life of approximately 90 hours, which we believe is in line with the potential for once-weekly dosing in humans. The half-life of the unmasked TROP2-TCE was less than two hours. We illustrate our TROP2-TRACTr and the TROP2-TCE half-lives in our NHP study in the figure below.
 
Figure 21. Our TROP2-TRACTr had a half-life of 90 hours in NHPs, which we believe is in line with once-weekly dosing in humans
 

In this same study, dosing of our TROP2-TRACTr at 100µg/kg resulted in minimal levels of inflammatory cytokine production, relative to an unmasked TROP2-TCE at 3µg/kg, which led to a greater than 20-fold expression of IL-6 as shown in the figure below. We believe these data suggest our TROP2-TRACTr has the potential to reduce CRS risk relative to an unmasked TROP2-TCE.
 
Figure 22. Dosing of our TROP2-TRACTr in NHPs had minimal effects on inflammatory cytokine levels. In contrast, dosing of a TROP2-TCE led to substantial levels of IL-6 as well as elevation of other inflammatory cytokines commonly observed in CRS.
 


Clinical development plans
 We expect to select a development candidate for TROP2-TRACTr in 2023.
 
Our PD-L1 x CD28 TRACIr (JANX009) for the treatment of solid tumors
 Activation of T cells is a highly regulated process that typically requires two signaling events for full functionality: the first signal is initiated upon binding of the MHC-antigen complex, which helps distinguish “self” from “non-self” to the T cell receptor (TCR) and the second signal through activation of a costimulatory receptor. While the first recognition signal activates a T cell and triggers T cell-mediated toxicity of the recognized cell, if the T cell does not receive a second costimulatory signal, it can lead to T cell tolerance whereby the T cells continue to recognize the tumor antigen but do not mount an immune response against the tumor cell. The second costimulatory signal prevents T cell tolerance and further activates the T cell to enhance T cell cytotoxicity towards the targeted cell. The interaction of tumor cells and T cells with and without our PD-L1xCD28 costimulatory bispecific is depicted in the figure below.
 
Figure 23. T cell costimulatory bispecific activators such as our PD-L1xCD28 program have the potential to increase activation both as monotherapy and in combination with TCEs




In NHPs, our PD-L1xCD28-TRACIr exhibited an extended PK profile compared to non-masked PD-L1xCD28 in NHPs, as shown in the figure below. We believe this approach supports once-weekly dosing in humans.
 
Figure 24. Our PD-L1xCD28-TRACIr exhibited extended PK profile compared to non-masked PD-L1xCD28 in NHPs
 


Our PD-L1xCD28 costimulatory bispecific is designed to act both as an antagonist of PD-L1 and a conditional agonist of CD28 as shown in the figure above. While CD28 agonism has shown some clinical promise, the efficacy seen with this approach has been limited due to dose-limiting toxicities that result from systemic activation of CD28. Our PD-L1xCD28 costimulatory bispecific is designed to conditionally agonize CD28 only in the presence of PD-L1, which is often overexpressed by tumors to avoid T cell- mediated killing. In addition, engagement of PD-L1 by our costimulatory bispecific is designed to block PD-1 binding and provide checkpoint inhibition. We believe this unique combination of potential mechanisms of action could enhance anti-tumor responses and limit the systemic toxicity of CD28 agonism. This is supported by studies in NHPs with our costimulatory bispecific demonstrating a
lack of systemic immune system activation as evidenced by the lack of cytokine release, as shown in the figure below.
 
Figure 25. Dosing of our PD-L1xCD28 costimulatory bispecific in NHPs had minimal effects on inflammatory cytokine levels, and several of these were below limits of quantification‌
 


Despite unprecedented clinical response rates, most patients fail to respond to therapies targeting PD-1 and PD-L1. We believe this is partly because T cells require costimulation for full functionality, to enable the immune system to attack a tumor fully. We believe the addition of immune costimulatory agents could derive further benefit. A preclinical study comparing a checkpoint antibody with our costimulatory bispecific with PD-L1 expressing tumor cells demonstrated induction of T cell cytotoxicity and IFNg release with the costimulatory bispecific and lack of activity with the checkpoint antibody, as shown in the figure below. In addition, IL-2 release was observed with the costimulatory bispecific, which is consistent with CD28 agonism. We believe that intra-tumoral release of IL-2 has the potential to further enhance the activity of tumor resident T cells to improve activity further.
 
Figure 26. Our unmasked PD-L1xCD28 bispecific led to T cell-dependent anti-tumor activity and the release of IFNg and IL-2 from T cells in preclinical studies
 


We plan to clinically evaluate the single-agent activity of our costimulatory bispecific to treat patients with PD-L1 expressing tumors, including those refractory to, or relapsed from, approved checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
Additional supporting evidence for this strategy is provided in the figure below, where our costimulatory bispecific demonstrated T cell-mediated killing of a range of different cancer cells, including breast cancer, NSCLC, and skin cancer.
 
Figure 27. Our PD-L1xCD28 bispecific led to T cell-mediated cell killing of a number of cell lines
 
We also plan to evaluate our costimulatory bispecific in combination with our TRACTrs clinically. Since TCE activation of T cells occurs via the first signal, we expect improved activity when combined with our costimulatory bispecific. In preclinical studies, our costimulatory bispecific enhanced anticancer activity greater than 30-fold when combined with a PSMA-TCE. We believe these data highlight the potential synergy between a PD-L1/CD28 bispecific and a CD3-directed TCE, as shown in the figure below.
 
Figure 28. Our PD-L1xCD28 bispecific combined with a TCE led to increased cell killing in preclinical studies
 

To reduce potential toxicities and enable combination therapy with our TRACTrs we optimized the masks for our T cell costimulatory bispecific molecules. We also modified them to contain our proprietary cleavable linkers and albumin-binding domain with the goal of creating bispecific product candidates that can be safely administered with a long half-life when in the inactive state, and display potent T cell costimulatory activity that is limited to tumor sites. We anticipate developing this bispecific costimulatory molecule both as a monotherapy and in combination with other T cell engagers, including with our TRACTr programs. The below schematic illustrates the potentially synergistic benefit of combining our bispecific costimulatory molecule with our TRACTrs. In this scenario, TRACTr-mediated anti-tumor activity is further enhanced through a reversal of tumor-mediated immunesuppression via simultaneous binding to PD-L1 and CD28 mediated by our costimulatory bispecific.

Clinical development plans
 We plan to submit an IND in 2023 to conduct a Phase 1 trial in patients with advanced solid tumors to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics.‌
 
Manufacturing
 Certain features of our TRACTr and TRACIr molecules allow for their development, manufacturing and control processes to closely resemble those used for standard monoclonal antibodies. First, our TRACTr and TRACIr molecules are readily expressed at high levels recombinantly in common Chinese hamster ovary cells. Second, our TRACTr and TRACIr molecules bind protein A via the anti-albumin-binding domain. Protein A affinity chromatography is the standard technique for capturing recombinant monoclonal antibodies and is a very robust purification procedure due to its specificity. After the protein A affinity chromatography step, TRACTrs and TRACIrs are further purified and polished using standard ion exchange, hydrophobic-interaction and/or multi-modal chromatography, virus filtration, and ultrafiltration/diafiltration formulation steps. Our anticipated dosing strategy gives us the advantage of manufacturing at relatively modest scale and formulating our drug products at low protein concentrations in typical formulation matrices. Through developability and manufacturability assessments, we continue to verify that our TRACTr and TRACIr constructs have advantageous properties that include high solubility, minimal aggregation, and good stability. We believe all these attributes will allow our products to be manufactured at a substantially lower cost than monoclonal antibodies.
 We do not own or operate and currently have no plans to establish current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) manufacturing facilities and laboratories. We currently rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers for the raw materials and starting components used to make our TRACTrs and TRACIrs, and we expect to continue to do so to meet our development, clinical and commercial needs. Our third-party manufacturers are qualified to manufacture our product candidates under cGMP requirements and other applicable laws, guidance and regulations.
We believe there are multiple sources for all of the materials and components required for the manufacture of our product candidates.
 All of our TRACTrs and TRACIrs are and will continue to be manufactured from a vial of a master cell bank or working cell bank of that biologic therapeutic’s production cell line. We have or intend to have one master cell bank for each TRACTr and TRACIr that was or will be produced and tested in accordance with cGMP and applicable regulations. Each master cell bank is or will be stored in two independent locations, and we intend to produce working cell banks for each product candidate later in the course of product development. It is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks from multiple locations and have our manufacturing severely impacted by the need to replace the cell banks. However, we believe we have an adequate backup should any particular cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event.
 We currently and plan to continue to obtain bulk drug substance (BDS) for our TRACTrs and TRACIrs from a single-source third-party contract manufacturer. While any reduction or halt in the supply of BDS from this contract manufacturer could limit our ability to develop our product candidates until a replacement contract manufacturer is found and qualified, we believe that we will have sufficient BDS to support future clinical trial programs. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates and have and intend to continue to put in place agreements under which our third-party contract manufacturers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of BDS and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development and commercial supply needs.
 
Competition
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of cancer immunotherapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with new immunotherapies that may become available in the future.
 We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other related markets that develop immuno oncology treatments. Many other companies have commercialized and/or are developing immuno oncology treatments for cancer including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, such as AbbVie, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Gilead, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co., Novartis, Pfizer, Regeneron and Roche/Genentech.
 We face significant competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that target specific tumor-associated antigens using immune cells or other cytotoxic modalities. These generally include immune cell redirecting therapeutics (e.g., T cell engagers, T cell immunomodulators), adoptive cellular therapies (e.g., CAR T cell therapies), antibody-drug conjugates, targeted radiopharmaceuticals, targeted immunotoxin, and targeted cancer vaccines.
 With respect to our lead PSMA-TRACTr, we are aware of other competing PSMA-targeting clinical-stage therapeutics, which include, but are not limited to: T cell engagers from Amgen, Abbvie/Calibr, Crescendo Biologics, Johnson and Johnson, Lava Therapeutics and Regeneron; T cell immunomodulators from Regeneron; antibody-drug conjugates from Ambrx; CAR T cell therapies from Gilead/Tmunity Therapeutics; and radiopharmaceuticals from Novartis, Point Biopharma, Telix and Bayer.
 With respect to our EGFR-TRACTr, we face competition from several targeted therapies approved by the FDA to treat CRC, including, but not limited to, Roche’s bevacizumab, Amgen’s panitumumab, Eli Lilly/Merck KGaA’s cetuximab, Bayer’s regorafenib, and Eli Lilly’s ramucirumab. We also face competition from other anti-EGFR immunotherapies that are in clinical development. We believe that the most advanced candidates are those being developed by Amgen/CytomX, Merus, Regeneron, Roche and Takeda.
 With respect to our TROP2-TRACTr, Gilead’s sacituzumab govitecan was the first ADC approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed/refractory metastatic TNBC. We are aware of other TROP2 therapies that are in clinical development for solid tumors. We believe that the most advanced candidates are Daiichi Sankyo/AstraZeneca’s ADC DS-8201 andMerck’s MK-2870. Additional competition may come from leading
companies in lung cancer and breast cancer, including, but not limited to, AstraZeneca, Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck KGaA, Pfizer, Roche Holding AG.
 With respect to our PD-L1 x CD28 TRACIr, we are aware of other CD28-based multispecifics that are in clinical development for solid tumors. We believe the most advanced candidates are ‌Regeneron’s REGN5678, REGN5668 and REGN7075, Sanofi’s SAR443216, and Janssen/Xencor’s Xmab008. Additional competition may come from other companies developing costimulatory multispecifics, including, but not limited to Genmab/BioNTech, Inhibrx, Incyte/Merus, and Roche.
 We are currently developing a pipeline of TRACTr and other protease-activated therapeutics that face increasing competition from other biologic prodrug developers, which include, but are not limited to, Adagene, BioAtla, Chugai Pharmaceutical Co./Roche Holding AG, CytomX Therapeutics, Harpoon Therapeutics, Merck & Co., Sanofi, and Xilio Therapeutics.
 Many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved drugs than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites, and enrolling subjects for any future clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 We could see a reduction or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we or our collaborators are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety, and convenience. If we are not successful in developing, commercializing, and achieving higher levels of reimbursement than our competitors, we will not be able to compete against them and our business would be materially harmed.
 
Research Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.
 On December 15, 2020, we and Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (Merck), entered into a research collaboration and exclusive license agreement (the Merck Agreement). The Merck Agreement provides that we and Merck will use commercially reasonable efforts to engage in certain research and development activities related to our TRACTr platform technology that are to be funded by Merck up to specified annual limits. Pursuant to the agreement, Merck had the right to designate up to two TRACTr product candidates in each case to be developed against a target (a Collaboration Target). We granted Merck an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to certain of our patent rights and know-how with respect to the Collaboration Targets, in each case once designated by Merck, to research, develop, make, have made, use, import, offer to sell, and sell compounds and any licensed products related thereto. Merck selected one of the Collaboration Targets upon execution of the Merck Agreement and selected the second Collaboration Target in May 2022. Following the research term, Merck will have the sole right to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize the licensed compounds and products directed against the Collaboration Targets.
 In consideration of the rights granted to Merck under the Merck Agreement, Merck paid us a one-time upfront payment of $8.0 million in respect of the first Collaboration Target and paid us an additional one-time payment of $8.0 million upon the selection of the second Collaboration Target. In addition, Merck is required to make milestone payments to us upon the successful completion of certain regulatory and development milestones, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $142.5 million for each of the two Collaboration Targets ($285.0 million collectively for both Collaboration Targets). Merck is also required to make milestone payments to us upon the successful completion of certain sales milestones, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350.0 million for each licensed product under either of the Collaboration Targets.

Merck is also required to make tiered royalty payments on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, ranging from low single-digit to low teens percentage royalty rates, on specified portions of annual net sales for licensed products under either of the Collaboration Targets that are commercialized. Such royalties are subject to reduction, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, for licensed products not covered by patent claims, or that require Merck to obtain a license to third-party intellectual property in order to commercialize the‌ licensed product, or that are subject to compulsory licensing. Merck’s royalty obligation with respect to a given licensed product in a given country begins upon, and ends no less than 10 years following, the first sale of such product in such country.
 The Merck Agreement will terminate at the end of the calendar year in which the expiration of all royalty obligations occurs for all licensed products under the agreement. Merck has the unilateral right to terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a Collaboration Target by Collaboration Target basis at any time and for any reason upon prior written notice to us. Both parties have the right to terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach, certain illegal or unethical activities, and insolvency of the other party. Upon expiration of the agreement but not early termination thereof, and provided all payments due under the agreement have been made, Merck’s exclusive licenses under the agreement will become fully paid-up and perpetual.
 
License Agreement with WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited
 In April 2021, we entered into a cell line license agreement (Cell Line License Agreement) with WuXi Biologics (Hong Kong) Limited (WuXi Biologics), pursuant to which we received a non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain of WuXi Biologics’ patent rights, know-how and biological materials (WuXi Biologics Licensed Technology), to use the WuXi Biologics Licensed Technology to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import certain therapeutic products produced through the use of the cell line licensed by WuXi Biologics under the Cell Line License Agreement (WuXi Biologics Licensed Product). Specifically, the WuXi Biologics Licensed Technology is used to manufacture a component of our PSMA-TRACTr and EGFR-TRACTr product candidates.
 In consideration for the license, we agreed to pay WuXi Biologics a non-refundable, one-time license fee of $0.2 million upon Wuxi Biologics’ achievement of a certain technical milestone, which was achieved in May 2021. Additionally, if we do not engage WuXi Biologics or its affiliates to manufacture the WuXi Biologics Licensed Products for our commercial supplies, we are required to make royalty payments to WuXi Biologics in an amount equal to a low single-digit percentage of specified portions of net sales of WuXi Biologics Licensed Products manufactured by a third-party manufacturer. We have the right (but not the obligation) to buy out our remaining royalty obligations with respect to each WuXi Biologics Licensed Product by paying WuXi Biologics a one-time payment in an amount ranging from low single digit million dollars to a maximum of $15.0 million depending on the development and commercialization stage of the WuXi Biologics Licensed Product (the Buyout Option), and upon such payment, our license with respect to such WuXi Biologics Licensed Product will become fully paid-up, irrevocable, and perpetual. The royalty obligations will remain in effect during the term of the Cell Line License Agreement so long as we have not exercised the Buyout Option.
 The Cell Line License Agreement will continue indefinitely unless terminated (i) by us upon three months’ prior written notice and our payment of all amounts due to WuXi Biologics through the effective date of termination, (ii) by either party for the other party’s material breach that remains uncured for 30 days after written notice, and (iii) by WuXi Biologics if we fail to make a payment and such failure continues for 30 days after receiving notice of such failure.
 
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We own the patents and patent applications relating to our TRACTr and TRACIr platform technologies. Our intellectual property policy includes seeking to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, striving to obtain issued patents by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States, directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates, continued innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of immunotherapy. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and
patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how; to obtain and maintain licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
 As of February 15, 2023, we own 16 pending U.S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications, two U.S. patents, 12 pending patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and 16 foreign patent applications. Specifically, we have one U.S. non-provisional patent application and five foreign patent applications directed to compositions of our TRACTr and TRACIr platform technologies that are applicable across our product candidates for our PSMA-TRACTr (JANX007), EGFR-TRACTr (JANX008), and costimulatory bispecific (JANX009) and our TROP2-TRACTr program. We also have two PCT patent applications, one U.S. patent, one U.S. non-provisional patent application, five foreign patent applications that cover compositions and applications of various components and aspects of our TRACTr and TRACIr platform technologies and have general applicability across various product candidates. We have one PCT patent application that covers compositions and applications of components of our TRACTr platform technology that has generally applicability to TRACTr product candidates. We further have one U.S. patent, two U.S. provisional patent applications, two PCT patent applications, one U.S. non-provisional patent application, and two foreign patent applications specific to JANX007, two U.S. provisional patent applications, two PCT patent applications, and two foreign patent applications specific to our TROP2-TRACTr program, two U.S. provisional patent applications, three PCT applications, and two foreign patent applications specific to JANX008, and one U.S. provisional patent application and one PCT patent application specific to JANX009. In addition, we have six U.S. non-provisional patent applications and one PCT patent application relating to compositions of our other proprietary antibodies, compounds, technology, inventions, improvements, and other aspects of our technology that are not under active development. Any patents that issue from these pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2038 and 2043, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology.
 With respect to our product candidates and processes, we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, and we intend to pursue patent protection directed to, when possible, compositions, methods of use, methods of making, dosing, and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing, therapeutic development processes and technologies, and therapeutic delivery technologies.
 Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date excluding U.S. provisional applications. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that is directed to or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date excluding U.S. provisional applications. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its claims, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of immunotherapy has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and enforce the patent rights that we may license, and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful
in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even the issued patents that we license do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and the issued patents that we may in-license and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or that we may exclusively in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. A comprehensive discussion on risks relating to intellectual property is provided under the section of this Annual Report titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Government Regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products, such as our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines. Generally, before a new drug or biologic can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
Regulatory Approval in the United States
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of biologic products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as clinical hold, FDA refusal to approve pending biologics license applications (BLAs), warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 A biologic must be approved by the FDA pursuant to a BLA before it may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
 •completion of extensive preclinical laboratory and animal studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP) requirements;
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be commenced;
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (GCP) requirements and other regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
 •submission to the FDA of a BLA;
 •payment of any user fees for FDA review of the BLA;

•a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
 •satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic, or components thereof, will be produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing processes (cGMP) requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •satisfactory completion of any potential FDA audits of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA to assure compliance with GCPs and integrity of the clinical data;
 •FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee; and
 •compliance with any post-approval requirements, including REMS, where applicable, and post- approval studies required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
 
Preclinical Studies
 Before testing any biological product candidates in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product candidates and formulations, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Some long-term preclinical testing may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated in the trial. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Information about certain clinical trials, including clinical trial results, must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration.
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA. The FDA will accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the clinical trial was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary.

Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, which may overlap or be combined:
 •Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability, safety of the product candidate, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness.
 •Phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in disease-affected patients to evaluate proof of concept and/or determine the dosing regimen(s) for subsequent investigations. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
 •Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an
 •adequate basis for product labeling. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the biologic.
 A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness (generally subject to the requirement of additional post-approval studies).
 The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated checkpoints based on access to certain data from the trial.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and, among other things, companies must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational medicines do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life.
 
FDA Review Process
 Following completion of the clinical trials, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety, purity, and potency of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the United States. The cost of preparing and submitting a BLA is substantial. Under the PDUFA, each BLA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. The applicant under an approved BLA is also subject to an annual program fee.
 The FDA reviews all submitted BLAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information. The FDA must make a decision on accepting a BLA for filing within 60 days of receipt, and such decision could include a refusal to file by the FDA. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10
months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of an original BLA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of an original BLA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and the review process can be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications.
 The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements and the integrity of the data supporting safety and efficacy. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA, it will issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the BLA and may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 As a condition of BLA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the biologic outweigh the potential risks to patients. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure a product’s safe use (ETASU). An ETASU can include, but is not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing the product, dispensing the product only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient-specific registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, the FDA may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States.
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. In addition, if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same product for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may
receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication. In the latter case, because healthcare professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses based on their independent medical judgement, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite another product’s orphan exclusivity.
 An orphan-designated product may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates.
 For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, product candidates are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic candidate can request the FDA to designate the candidate for a specific indication for fast track status concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the candidate. The FDA must determine if the biologic candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy, priority review and accelerated approval.
 Breakthrough therapy designation may be granted for products that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Under the breakthrough therapy program, the sponsor of a new biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the submission of the IND for the biologic candidate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process, providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval, involving more senior staff in the review process, assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team and taking other steps to design the clinical studies in an efficient manner.
 Priority review may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and for original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
 Accelerated approval may be granted for products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long, and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a product, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs
rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of products for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large studies to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process.
 
Pediatric Information
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), BLAs or supplements to BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the biological product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data.
 The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (the BPCA) provides a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a biologic if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new biologic in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 Once a BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in a manner consistent with the provisions of the approved labeling. Although physicians may prescribe products for off-label uses as the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician’s choice of drug treatment made in the physician’s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. Companies may only share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling.
 Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic safety summary reports is required following FDA approval of a BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, biological product manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects a biologic product’s manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with required regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or
with manufacturing processes or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning or other enforcement-related letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. A reference biological product is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the
 biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency.
 
Regulatory Approval in the European Union
 The EMA is an agency of the European Union. It coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorized medicinal products. Through its Committees, particularly the Committee on Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) it conducted scientific evaluation of applications for EU marketing authorizations, as well as the development of technical guidance and the provision of scientific advice to sponsors.
There are similarities between the process regarding approval of medicinal products in the European Union and that in the United States. The new Clinical Trials Regulation that came into force on January 31, 2022 aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The Clinical Trials Regulation introduces a complete overhaul of the existing legislation governing clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal”; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU member states in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (member states concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each member state concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be
governed by the national law of the concerned EU member state. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 Manufacturing and import into the EU of investigational medicinal products is subject to the holding of appropriate authorizations and must be carried out in accordance with cGMP.
 
Review and Approval
 Authorization to market a product in the European Union member states proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure or a national procedure. Since our products by their virtue of being antibody-based biologics fall under the centralized procedure, only this procedure will be described here.
 Certain drugs, including medicinal products developed by means of biotechnological processes, must be approved via the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization. A successful application under the centralized authorization procedure results in a marketing authorization from the European Commission, which is automatically valid in all European Union member states. The other European Economic Area member states (namely Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) are also obligated to recognize the European Commission decision. The EMA and the European Commission administer the centralized authorization procedure.
 Under the centralized authorization procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the CHMP), serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of human products on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state’s national drug authority, with one of them appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the assistance of a further member of the CHMP acting as a Co-Rapporteur. The CHMP is required to issue an opinion within 210 days of receipt of a valid application, though the clock is stopped if it is necessary to ask the applicant for clarification or further supporting data. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report is produced. If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product is sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. The CHMP’s opinion is sent to the European Commission, which uses the opinion as the basis for its decision whether or not to grant a marketing authorization.
After a medicinal product has been authorized by the European Commission and launched in the EEA, it is a condition of maintaining the marketing authorization that all aspects relating to its quality, safety and efficacy must be kept under review by the MAH. Sanctions may be imposed for failure to adhere to the conditions of the marketing authorization. In extreme cases, the authorization may be revoked, resulting in withdrawal of the product from sale.
 
Conditional Approval and Accelerated Assessment
 As per Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) 726/2004, a medicine that is demonstrated to fulfill an unmet medical need may, if its immediate availability is in the interest of public health, be the subject of a conditional marketing authorization on the basis of less complete clinical data than are normally required, subject to specific obligations being imposed on the authorization holder. Fulfilment of these specific obligations is reviewed annually by the EMA. A conditional authorization is valid for 12 months, and may be renewed.
 When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a medicinal product for human use which is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may request an accelerated assessment procedure pursuant to Article 14.9 of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. Under the accelerated assessment procedure, the CHMP is required to issue an opinion within 150 days of receipt of a valid application, subject to clock stops. We believe that some of the disease indications in which our product candidates are currently being or may be developed in the future qualify for this provision, and we will take advantage of this provision as appropriate.
 
Period of Authorization and Renewals
 A marketing authorization is initially valid for five years and may then be renewed on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. Once renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one
additional five-year renewal period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the EU market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization shall cease to be valid (the “sunset clause”).
 The EU provides opportunities for data and market exclusivity related to certain types of marketing authorizations. Upon grant of related marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally benefit from eight years of data exclusivity and 10 years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EEA from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic application or biosimilar application for eight years from the date of authorization of the innovative product, after which a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EEA until 10 years have elapsed from the initial marketing authorization of the reference product in the EEA. The overall ten year period may, occasionally, be extended for a further year to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical/biological entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 
Orphan Medicinal Product Designation
 Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000, as implemented by Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provides that a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that (1) the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
In the EU, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of the MAA. Orphan medicinal product designation entitles an applicant to incentives such fee reductions or fee waivers, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized MA procedure. Upon grant of an MA, orphan medicinal products are entitled to a ten-year period of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication, which means that the EMA cannot accept another MAA, or grant an MA, or accept an application to extend an MA for a similar product for the same indication for a period of ten years. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for orphan medicinal products that have also complied with an agreed PIP. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications. Orphan medicinal product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 The period of market exclusivity may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria on the basis of which it received orphan medicinal product destination, including where it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity or where the prevalence of the condition has increased above the threshold. Additionally, an MA may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the 10 year period if: (i) if the applicant consents to a second original orphan medicinal product application, (ii) if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities; or (iii) if the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. A company may voluntarily remove a product from the register of orphan products.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 Where an MA is granted in relation to a medicinal product in the EU, the holder of the MA is required to comply with a range of regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products.

Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the individual EU member states. The holder of an MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 In the EU, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to both EU and EU member states’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities in connection with an MA. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU.
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Data Privacy and Security Laws
 In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share (collectively, “Process”, “Processing” or “Processed) personal information or other sensitive data, including proprietary and confidential business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, data we collect about trial participants in connection with clinical trials, and sensitive third-party data. Accordingly, we are, or may become, subject to numerous data privacy and security obligations, including federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements, and other obligations related to data privacy and security.
In the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal information privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), imposes specific requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. As another example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) applies to personal information of consumers, business representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. Although the CCPA exempts some data Processed in the context of clinical trials, the CCPA increases compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we maintain about California residents. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (CPRA), established a new regulatory agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the CCPA. Furthermore, U.S. federal and state consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal information and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal information.
 Outside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards govern data privacy and security. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (EU GDPR) and the EU GDPR as it forms part of United Kingdom (UK) law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the UK GDPR) impose strict requirements for Processing personal information. Under the
EU GDPR and UK GDPR, companies may face temporary or definitive bans on data Processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million Euros (£17.5 million for the UK GDPR) or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to Processing of personal information brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests.
Marketing
 Similarly to the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union member states, and, in the U. K, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment.
 Payments made to physicians in certain European Union member states must be publicly disclosed on the basis of applicable sunshine rules. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, their competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union member states. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the individual European Union member states. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.
 
International Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States and the European Union, a variety of foreign regulations govern clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country and the time to approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or European Commission approval.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations and Legislative Reform
 
Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 Healthcare providers, including physicians, and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our operations, including any arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would research, as well as market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (HHS) (including the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. The healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:
 •The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has also been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other hand. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, but the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection.

•Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the False Claims Act (FCA), which can be enforced by private citizens on behalf of the government through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and the federal civil monetary penalty laws prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false, fictitious or fraudulent claims for payment of federal funds, and knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the FCA in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal healthcare programs for the product. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims.
 •HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal liability for executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and creates federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 •The federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act), which requires, among other things, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physicians assistants or nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests, including such ownership and investment interests held by a physician’s immediate family members.
 •Analogous state and foreign anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws that require the reporting of information related to drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
 Any action brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including, among others, significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, reputational harm, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
 Many EU Member States periodically review their reimbursement procedures for medicinal products, which could have an adverse impact on reimbursement status. We expect that legislators, policymakers and healthcare insurance funds in the EU Member States will continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures, such as
lower maximum prices, lower or lack of reimbursement coverage and incentives to use cheaper, usually generic, products as an alternative to branded products, and/or branded products available through parallel import to keep healthcare costs down. Moreover, in order to obtain reimbursement for our products in some EEA countries, including some EU Member States, we may be required to compile additional data comparing the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States, including those representing the larger markets. The HTA process is the procedure to assess therapeutic, economic and societal impact of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country. The outcome of an HTA will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product currently varies between EU Member States.
 
Legislative Reform
 We operate in a highly regulated industry, and new laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery and payment for healthcare products and services could negatively affect our business, financial condition and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting healthcare reforms, and it is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and the governments of other countries will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation.
 For example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs such as:
 •increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;
 •established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government;
 •expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program;
 •established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (increased to 70% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
 •extended manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
 •expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
 •created a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including our product candidates, that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
 •established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
 •established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending; and
 •created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products.

There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, in 2017, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act), which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. In addition, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 “IRA” into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in Affordable Care Act marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act.
 In addition, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the federal and state level in the United States that seek to reduce healthcare costs. In 2011, the U.S. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act, which included provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers beginning in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2031. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. In addition, in 2012, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Taxpayer Relief Act, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several presidential executive orders, congressional inquiries and proposed legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. The IRA also, among other things, (1) directs HHS to negotiate the price of certain single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare and (2) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. It is currently unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022 directing HHS to submit a report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. It is unclear whether this executive order or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future.
In December 2021, Regulation No 2021/2282 on Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, amending Directive 2011/24/EU, was adopted in the EU. This Regulation, which entered into force in January 2022 and will apply as of January 2025, is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The Regulation foresees a three-year transitional period and will permit EU Member States to use common HTA tools, methodologies, and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas, including joint clinical assessment of the innovative health technologies with the most potential impact for patients, joint scientific consultations whereby developers can seek advice from HTA authorities, identification of emerging health technologies to identify promising technologies early, and continuing voluntary cooperation in other areas. Individual EU Member States will continue to be responsible for assessing non-clinical (e.g., economic, social, ethical) aspects of health technologies, and making decisions on pricing and reimbursement. If we are unable to maintain favorable pricing and reimbursement status in EU Member States for product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval, any anticipated revenue from and growth prospects for those products in the EU could be negatively affected.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and Regulations
 We and our third-party contractors are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Hazardous chemicals, including flammable and biological materials, are involved in certain aspects of our business, and we cannot eliminate the risk of injury or contamination from the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. In the event of contamination or injury, or failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, fines and penalties associated with such liability could exceed our assets and resources. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 The availability and extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement by governmental and private third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive medical treatments. In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors decide which products will be covered and establish reimbursement levels for those products.
 Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:
 •a covered benefit under its health plan;
 •safe, effective and medically necessary;
 •appropriate for the specific patient;
 •cost-effective; and
 •neither experimental nor investigational. 
 Obtaining coverage approval and reimbursement for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement at a satisfactory level. If coverage and adequate reimbursement of our future products, if any, are unavailable or limited in scope or amount, such as may result where alternative or generic treatments are available, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. Adverse coverage and reimbursement limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in our product candidates, even if such product candidates obtain regulatory approval. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices
often associated with such products. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.
 There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. There is no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement in the United States and, as a result, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. In the United States, private payors often, but not always, follow Medicare coverage and reimbursement policies with respect to newly approved products. It is difficult to predict what third-party payors will decide with respect to coverage and reimbursement for fundamentally novel products such as ours, as there is no body of established practices and precedents for these new products. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for that product. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. In addition to third-party payors, professional organizations and patient advocacy groups such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society of Clinical Oncology can influence decisions about reimbursement for new medicines by determining standards for care. Therefore, it is possible that any of our product candidates, even if approved, may not be covered by third-party payors or the reimbursement limit may be so restrictive that we cannot commercialize the product candidates profitably.
 Reimbursement agencies in the European Union may be more restrictive than payors in the United States. For example, a number of cancer products have been approved for reimbursement in the United States but not in certain European countries. In Europe, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. For example, some countries provide that products may be marketed only after an agreement on reimbursement price has been reached. Such pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Other countries require the completion of additional health technology assessments that compare the cost- effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. In addition, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product, may adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market or monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. Furthermore, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceutical products, and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, and prescription products in particular, has become increasingly intense. As a result, there are increasingly higher barriers to entry for new products. There can be no assurance that any country that has reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved in those countries. Accordingly, the reimbursement for any products in the European Union may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits.
 Furthermore, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of foreign and domestic governments as well as private third-party payors. The prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments and private third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. We also expect to experience pricing pressures due to the trend towards managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. These and other cost-control initiatives could cause us to decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower-than-anticipated product revenues. In addition, the publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels or if coverage and adequate reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, our revenues and the potential profitability of our product candidates in those countries would be negatively affected.


Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.
Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, where we lease office and laboratory space pursuant to a lease agreement which commenced in July, 2022 and expires in January, 2033. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for the foreseeable future. As we expand, we believe that suitable additional alternative spaces will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if required.
