Impact of COVID-19
 
As discussed in more detail below under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on our business, particularly in our Specialty Health Care segment, where it impacted the schools where many of the Company’s personnel work.
 
Industry Overview
 
Businesses today face intense competition, the challenge of constant technological change and the ongoing need for business process optimization. To address these issues and to compete more effectively, companies are continually evaluating the need for implementing innovative solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes. As a result, the ability of an organization to integrate and align advanced technologies with new business objectives is critical.

Industry Overview (Continued)
 
In the health care services industry, a shortage of nurses and other medical personnel in the United States has led to increases in business activity for health care service companies, including the Company’s Specialty Health Care group. Due in part to an aging population and improved medical technology, the demand for selected health care professionals is expected to continue over the next several years, with an emphasis on leveraging technology to expand access to care. The increased adoption of telemedicine, an area in which the Specialty Health Care group has developed new service offerings, is a primary example. In addition, public educational institutions are outsourcing their requirements for school nurses, therapists and paraprofessionals to lower their costs and it is expected that this will continue and grow. Each of these dynamics have been exacerbated by COVID-19. The pandemic has also altered patterns in health care delivery, with newer delivery models gaining traction, namely telemedicine. Given federal and state regulatory changes as well as private insurer reimbursement methods, utilization of telemedicine services increased significantly. CDC researchers stated that maintaining the expansion of telehealth remains critical to providing access to care. It is expected the total addressable market opportunity will continue to expand and grow. Expanding access to behavioral health and mental well-being is also a priority for public health officials. Increasing and maintaining access to proper care remains a top priority and the market opportunity for these services is expected to continue to grow. While the Company believes that the demand for Healthcare related services remains historically high, the Company also believes this demand has subsided some as COVID-19 shifts from a pandemic to an endemic.
 
The Company’s Engineering group remains focused on areas of growth, primarily within the electric power, aerospace, marine and transportation, commercial and industrial, oil and gas, as well as biofuel industries. Given the current composition of its customer base, the Engineering group’s performance is well balanced between its three segments. In recent years, many electric utilities have prioritized transitioning their power generation assets to cleaner sources of energy. Much of this transformation is being driven by investments in renewable energy. The Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) estimates that 38% of the United States’ electric generation capacity will be comprised of wind and solar assets by 2050. This expansion will require extensive investment in the nation’s transmission infrastructure to interconnect these renewable resources to the energy grid. Projects of this scale will require engineering and design expertise, as well as the utilization of EPC services. As the world’s industrial output rebounds from pandemic-related weakness in 2020 and 2021, the Company believes its Process and Industrial group is positioned well to take advantage. Companies in the chemical industry are reprioritizing spending towards decarbonization technologies, with many US chemical companies expecting to place an emphasis on renewable feedstocks and new carbon recycling technologies. The Company believes its process engineering services can play a vital role across this multibillion-dollar opportunity.
 
Companies must integrate and manage computing environments consisting of multiple computing platforms, operating systems, databases and networking protocols and off-the-shelf software applications to support business objectives. Companies also need to keep pace with new technology developments, which often rapidly render existing equipment and internal skills obsolete. At the same time, varied factors have caused many organizations to focus on core competencies and trim workforces in the IT management area. Accordingly, these organizations often lack the quantity, quality and variety of IT skills necessary to design and support IT solutions. IT managers are charged with supporting increasingly complex systems and applications of significant strategic value, while working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints within their own organizations.
 
The Company believes its target market for IT services is among middle-market companies, which typically lack the time and technical resources to satisfy all of their IT needs internally. These companies commonly require sophisticated, experienced IT assistance to achieve their business objectives and often rely on IT service providers to help implement and manage their systems. RCM is structured to provide middle-market companies a single source for their IT needs.

Business Strategy 
 
RCM is dedicated to providing solutions to meet its clients’ business needs by delivering specialty health care, engineering, life sciences and information technology services. The Company’s objective is to remain a recognized leader of specialized professional staffing, consulting services and solutions in major markets throughout North America. The Company adapts operating strategies to achieve this objective. The following is a discussion of the key elements of its growth and operating strategies:
Growth Strategy 
 
Promote Full Life Cycle Solution Capability
 The Company promotes a full life cycle solution capability to its customers. The goal of the full life cycle solution strategy is to fully address a client’s project implementation cycle at each stage of its development and deployment. This entails the Company working with its clients from the initial conceptualization of a project through its design and project execution, and extending into ongoing management and support of the delivered product. RCM’s strategy is to build projects and solutions offerings selectively, utilizing its extensive resource base.
 
The Company believes that the effective execution of this strategy will generate improved margins on its existing resources. The completion of this service-offering continuum is intended to afford the Company the opportunity to strengthen long-term client relationships that will further contribute to a more predictable revenue stream.
 
In addition to a full life cycle solution offering, the Company continues to focus on transitioning into higher value oriented services in an effort to increase its margins on its various service lines and generate revenue that is more sustainable. The Company believes this transition is accomplished by pursuing additional vertical market specific solutions in conjunction or combination with longer-term based solutions, through expansion of its client relationships and by pursuing strategic alliances and partnerships.
 
Achieve Internal Growth
 The Company continues to promote its internal growth strategies which it designed to better serve the Company’s customers, generate higher revenue and achieve greater operating efficiencies. Every division of the Company continuously focuses on services and client diversification. Business units are collaborating on penetrating and servicing accounts as sales teams are increasing their activity levels. This enables clients to be supported by specialists in their areas of need while RCM productivity increases.
 
RCM provides an orientation program in which sales managers and professionals receive relevant information about Company operations.
 
RCM has adopted an industry-centric approach to sales and marketing. This initiative contemplates that clients within the same industry sectors tend to have common business challenges. It therefore allows the Company to present and deliver enhanced value to those clients in the vertical markets in which RCM has assembled the greatest work experience. RCM’s consultants continue to acquire project experience that offers differentiated awareness of the business challenges that clients in that industry are facing. This alignment also facilitates and creates additional cross-selling opportunities. The Company believes this strategy will lead to greater account penetration and enhanced client relationships.
 
Operational strategies contributing to RCM’s internal productivity include the delineation of certain new solutions practice areas in markets where its clients had historically known the Company as a contract service provider. The formation of these practice areas facilitates the flow of project opportunities and the delivery of project-based solutions.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
----------------------------

Growth Strategy (Continued) 
 
Pursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions
 The industries in which the Company operates continue to be highly fragmented, and the Company plans to continue to selectively assess opportunities to make strategic acquisitions as such opportunities are presented to the Company. The Company's acquisition strategy is designed to broaden the scope of services and technical competencies and grow its full life cycle solution capabilities. In considering acquisition opportunities, the Company focuses principally on companies with (i) technologies or market segments RCM has targeted for strategic value enhancement, (ii) margins that are accretive to existing margins, (iii) experienced management personnel, (iv) substantial growth prospects and (v) sellers who desire to join the Company’s management team. To retain and provide incentives for management of its acquired companies, the Company has generally structured a significant portion of the acquisition price in the form of multi-tiered consideration based on growth of operating profitability of the acquired company over a two to four year period.
Operating Strategy
 
Develop and Maintain Strong Customer Relationships
 The Company seeks to develop and maintain strong interactive customer relationships by anticipating and focusing on its customers’ needs. The Company emphasizes a relationship-oriented approach to business, rather than the transaction or assignment-oriented approach that the Company believes is used by many of its competitors. This industry-centric strategy is designed to allow RCM to expand further its relationships with clients in RCM’s targeted sectors.
 
To develop close customer relationships, the Company’s practice managers and/or salespeople regularly meet with both existing and prospective clients to identify areas of need and help design solutions and identify the resources needed to execute their strategies. The Company’s managers also maintain close communications with their customers during each project and on an ongoing basis after its completion. The Company believes that this relationship-oriented approach can result in greater customer satisfaction. Additionally, the Company believes that by collaborating with its customers in designing business solutions, it can generate new opportunities to cross-sell additional services that the Company has to offer. The Company focuses on providing customers with qualified individuals or teams of experts compatible with the business needs of its customers and makes a concerted effort to follow the progress of such relationships to ensure their continued success.
 
Attract and Retain Highly Qualified Consultants and Technical Resources
 The Company believes it has been successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified consultants and contractors by (i) providing stimulating and challenging work assignments, (ii) offering competitive wages, (iii) effectively communicating with its candidates, (iv) providing selective training to maintain and upgrade skills and (v) aligning the needs of its customers with appropriately skilled personnel. The Company believes it has been successful in retaining these personnel due in part to its use of practice managers who are dedicated to maintaining contact with, and monitoring the satisfaction levels of, the Company’s consultants and contractors while they are on assignment.

International Operations
 
The Company operates its business in Canada and, to a less significant extent, in Puerto Rico and Serbia. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 4.4% of the Company’s revenue were generated outside the United States. There are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including: the imposition of trade barriers, foreign exchange restrictions, longer payment cycles, greater difficulties in accounts receivables collection, difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws (including without limitation the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), changes in legal or regulatory requirements, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, complex and uncertain employment environments, political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences. Our operations in Serbia could be adversely affected by the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia, with which Serbia has substantial ties. Should sanctions against Russia affect Russia in a way that causes adverse economic consequences to Serbia, or if such sanctions were to be extended to countries that might be considered to be in alignment with Russia, thus could have a negative impact on our employees or operations both within and outside Serbia. To the extent the Company experiences these risks, the business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
 
From its headquarters locations in New Jersey, the Company provides its branch offices with centralized administrative, marketing, finance, MIS, human resources and legal support. Centralized administrative functions minimize the administrative burdens on branch office managers and allow them to spend more time focusing on sales and marketing and practice development activities.
 
Branch offices are primarily located in markets that the Company believes have strong growth prospects for the Company’s services. The Company’s branches are operated in a decentralized, entrepreneurial manner with most offices operating as independent profit centers.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
Sales and marketing efforts are conducted at the local and national level through the Company’s network of branch offices. Sales activities and productivity are tracked and rankings established and published. Sales between business units are recognized and financially encouraged. The Company emphasizes long-term personal relationships with customers that are developed through regular assessment of customer requirements and proactive monitoring of service performance. The Company’s sales personnel make regular visits to existing and prospective customers. New customers are obtained through active sales programs and referrals. The Company encourages its employees to participate in national and regional trade associations, local chambers of commerce and other civic associations. The Company seeks to develop strategic partnering relationships with its customers by providing comprehensive solutions for all aspects of a customer’s engineering, life sciences, information technology and other professional services needs. The Company concentrates on providing carefully screened professionals with the appropriate skills in a timely manner and at competitive prices. The Company regularly monitors the quality of the services provided by its personnel and obtains feedback from its customers as to their satisfaction with the services provided.
 
The Company serves Fortune 1000 companies and many middle market clients. The Company’s relationships with these customers are typically formed at the customers’ local or regional level and from time to time, when appropriate, at the corporate level for national accounts.

Key Customers 
 
The Company has established long-term relationships with many of its customers across each of its business segments. RCM’s emphasis on client retention has resulted in repeat business from many of its largest strategic accounts. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had two customers exceed 10% of consolidated revenue, representing 13.2% and 12.7% of consolidated revenue. The Company’s five, ten and twenty largest customers accounted for approximately 43.0%, 53.7% and 67.0%, respectively, of the Company’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
Other Information 
 
Safeguards - Business, Disaster and Contingency Planning
 RCM has implemented a number of safeguards to protect the Company from various system-related risks including Redundant Telecommunications and server systems architecture, multi-tiered server and desktop backup infrastructure, and data center physical and environmental controls. In addition, RCM has developed disaster recovery / business continuity procedures for all offices.
 
Given the significant amount of data generated in the Company’s key processes including recruiting, sales, payroll and customer invoicing, RCM has established redundant procedures, functioning on a daily basis, within the Company’s primary data center, which is a third-party Internet Data Center (“IDC”). This redundancy should mitigate the risks related to hardware, application and data loss by utilizing the concept of live differential backups of servers and desktops to Storage Area Network (SAN) devices on its backup LAN, culminating in offsite tape storage at an independent facility. Controls within the data center environment ensure that all systems are proactively monitored and data is properly archived.
 
Additionally, RCM has contracted and brokered strategic relationships with third-party vendors to meet its recovery objectives in the event of a system disruption. For example, comprehensive service level agreements for RCM’s data circuits and network devices guarantee minimal outages as well as network redundancy and scalability.
 
The Company’s ability to protect its data assets against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, and facility violations is critical. To address potential cyber security threats, the Company uses a third-party mail management service to filter all emails destined for the RCMT domain before being delivered to the corporate mail servers. The service has also been deployed to safeguard the enterprise from malicious internet content. The deployment of virus, spam, and patch management controls extends from the perimeter network to all desktops and is centrally monitored and managed. In addition to the virus and malware controls, an Intrusion Protection System (IPS) monitors and alerts on changes in network traffic patterns as well as known hostile signatures.
 
The Company maintains a disaster recovery plan that outlines the recovery time / point objectives (RTO / RPO), organization structure, roles and procedures, including site addendum disaster plans for all of its key operating offices.  Corporate IT personnel regulate the maintenance and integrity of backed-up data throughout the Company.
 
The IDC provides RCM with a robust data center environment with redundant HVAC, commercial power feeds, ten 2000kW diesel generator sets with five 10,000-gallon, above-ground fuel oil storage tanks to provide standby power and dry pipe fire suppression.  In addition, the IDC provides 24x7 security staffing, closed-circuit monitors, secure-card key access, biometrics scanners, man traps, and alarmed doors.

Competition
 
The market for engineering and IT services is highly competitive and is subject to rapid change. As the market demand has shifted, many software companies have adopted tactics to pursue services and consulting offerings making them direct competitors when in the past they may have been alliance partners. Primary competitors include participants from a variety of market segments, including publicly and privately held firms, systems consulting and implementation firms, application software firms, service groups of computer equipment companies, facilities management companies, general management consulting firms and staffing companies. In addition, the Company competes with its clients’ internal resources, particularly where these resources represent a fixed cost to the client. Such competition may impose additional pricing pressures on the Company.
 
The Company believes its principal competitive advantages in the engineering and life sciences and information technology services market include: strong relationships with existing clients, a long-term track record with over 1,000 clients, a broad range of services, technical expertise, knowledge and experience in multiple industry sectors, quality and flexibility of service, responsiveness to client needs and speed in delivering life sciences and information technology solutions.
 
Additionally, the Company competes for suitable acquisition candidates based on its differentiated acquisition model, its entrepreneurial and decentralized operating philosophy, and its strong corporate-level support and resources.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company’s operating results can be affected by the seasonal fluctuations in client expenditures. Expenditures in the Engineering, Life Sciences and Information Technology segments can be negatively impacted during the first quarter of the year when clients are finalizing their budgets. Quarterly results generally fluctuate depending on, among other things, the number of billing days in a quarter and the seasonality of clients’ businesses. The business is also affected by the timing of holidays and seasonal vacation patterns, generally resulting in lower revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of each year, not considering any non-seasonal impact. Extreme weather conditions may also affect demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year as certain clients’ facilities are located in geographic areas subject to closure or reduced hours due to inclement weather. The Company generally experiences an increase in its cost of sales and a corresponding decrease in gross profit and gross margin percentage in the first and second fiscal quarters of each year as a result of resetting certain state and federal employment tax rates and related salary limitations. Also, the Company’s Specialty Health Care segment typically experiences a significant decline in revenue due to the substantial closure of one of its largest customers, the New York City Department of Education, and other educational institution clients during the third quarter due to their summer recess.
Government Regulations
 
The Company is a consulting firm and employment service provider and is generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship between a firm and its employees, including tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, benefits, workplace compliance, wage and hour, anti-discrimination, immigration and workers’ compensation, (2) registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements, and (3) federal contractor compliance. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all employee related statutes.

We are always looking for ways to exceed compliance standards by utilizing continuous improvement discipline to eliminate risks in the workplace proactively.
 
The Company believes promoting engagement and empowering its workforce drives better business results.  As a result, the Company believes it has an "open door" culture whereby every member of its workforce is comfortable expressing their ideas on improving the Company and its performance.  Our culture has resulted in action plans at all levels of the organization and drives continuous conversations on the things that matter most to our workforce and their teams.
 
The Company's employees and contractors have generally divided into four groups: 1) Nonbillable employees; 2) Billable salaried employees; 3) Billable hourly long-term employees; 4) Billable hourly short-term employees and contractors.
 
Nonbillable employees are primarily full-time and salaried. These positions include but are not limited to executives, managers, general administration, finance, accounting, account managers, recruiters, credentialers, etcetera. These employees are not billed to clients. As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 280 nonbillable employees. The expense for these employees is included in the Company's selling, general, and administrative expense in its income statements.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (CONTINUED)
----------------------------

 
Billable salaried employees primarily include senior-level employees whose time is often billed to clients. These employees tend to be long-term in nature. Many are intended to produce high utilization rates (representing the percentage of their time billed to clients), often in the 90% to 100% range. However, some have nonbillable responsibilities such as account management, client proposal preparation, general strategy formulation, expert content generation, project controls, overseeing projects where their time is not billable, supervising billable personnel, etcetera. These employees' utilization rates generally range from 20% to 90%. Most of the expense for billable salaried employees are included in the Company's direct costs in its income statements.
 
Billable hourly long-term employees have very high utilization, typically in the 90% to 100%. For most of these employees, our goal is near 100% utilization. They are hired with the idea that we want them to work on multiple assignments, either in succession or simultaneously. Billable hourly short-term employees have near 100% utilization. They are typically hired for one assignment, and upon completion, they terminate.
 
As of December 31, 2022, our billable workforce comprised approximately 2,540 Specialty Health Care services personnel, 490 Engineering and Technical personnel, and 230 Life Sciences and Information Technology personnel assigned by the Company to work on client projects or assignments for various periods.  None of the Company's employees are party to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
The Company conducts business globally but is principally concentrated in the United States, Canada, Serbia/Europe, and Puerto Rico. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's workforce breaks out as follows:
 

● | United States and Puerto Rico: approximately 257 nonbillable and 3,450 billable
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Canada: approximately five nonbillable and 30 billable
